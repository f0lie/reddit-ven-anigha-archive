### The axe-handle has finally worn out.

The axe-handle has finally worn out.

# WHAT?

This is an attempt to summarize my journey. Knowing fully well that my axe-handle is truly worn out - by HH standards.

The first radical change in my view and being was in Feb/Mar 2022. The change cemented over subsequent months. Since then and until Sep '24 I had suspected streamentry but did not try to confirm it. I did not see a point because I have lost value for labels and achievements in my personal life. In any case, I figured, I have to continue on the path with my efforts anyway. Only thing that has nagged me until June '24 has been about how much to prioritize formal meditation - and whether it was really important - because, after all, I am a house-holder with precious-little me-time. I have contemplated and tried to practice HH teachings ever since I first came across them in beginning 2022 - I had no doubt that it was an important thing to do. Meditation - I have been doing regularly since 2020 COVID lockdowns - assuming that it too was an important thing to do. I had not been able to attribute my shift in view to contemplation (HH) or meditation, or in whatever proportion.. I had not been able to clearly discern the factors leading to my fruition.

# WHY?

In general I do not believe that I can learn from others' stories - because karma manifestations are unique to every individual. Even when reading Dhamma material, I always skip biographical parts - even, Siddharta Gautam's. Nevertheless, a minor reason for this post is to maybe help develop conviction in those who seek inspiration from others' lives; even if only to validate that HH approach works.

I am not looking for validation; I have conviction now in my fruit. HH community has helped me since 2022 - starting with essays and audio-recordings from Ajahn Nyanamoli on his website, Bhante Anigha's comments and essays, Sister Medhini's essays, yt channel of HH and Samanadipa, and the fellow beings part of this r/HH. I look forward to contemplating any points that arise in this post - like for any r/HH posts.

My parents are in their 70s - and I have always prodded them to read about Dhamma, practice meditation. They have intellectual interest and have been trying to meditate. I had been wanting to send them for Vipassana. While I had myself suspected to have attained the first fruit, I have not been sure about what made it click for me - and what is the most efficient way to get my parents there. As of Sep'24 I am clear about the way that I must help them. Their time is limited - and that is the sort of urgency that led me to validate my own path up until now - and crystallize what really needs to be done. There is no time to waste in formal meditations; it is about right contemplation. I know that now.

I do not hope to teach anyone - except my parents and kids. I am lazy about remembering exact things/facts; I cannot quote suttas if you ask me "where did I read that". I rely on my understanding and intuition developed thru contemplation. Even on r/HillsideHermitage  I hesitate to post my response because I only have intuitive understanding - and defending my viewpoint is not my cup of tea. IRL I do not engage in deep Dharma discussions; I keep to my own; I have had faith in me and the teachings that I can do this on my own; that there is no other real option anyway! :)

I have held back from an urge to make this kind of a post in last many months - because I could not clarify my intention. "I am no teacher. "I am not going to be able to really help out someone. "Will it not be mere chest-thumping? "I still have doubts regarding my own practice." There are 2-3 draft-posts that I never posted - and then later realized that it was good I did not post because I was proven wrong since writing them. The only journal I have maintained for last 2 years is that of my spiritual thoughts, contemplation, experiences; going forward I see little need for that.

(What about this post? will it end up in that journal without getting posted? I think not)

While reading and following discussions on r/HillsideHermitage have been rewarding, I have not had any questions to make a post-of around my lived-experience; I have had reasonable good clarity since 2022. Of course there are hypotheticals to ponder over - but I don't engage in them. So I have had nothing to contribute, really, to r/HH - but gained a lot of insights here. My gratitude to the folks here.

# BACKGROUND:

I am a house-holder with one kid in college and another in middle-school. I was an atheist until 2017 when a once-in-lifetime incident forced me to existential questions (WHY ME?) - and eventually led me to Dhamma in 2018. Since the event I have had many spiritual (touching) encounters with people, animals that convinced me of our inter-connectedness. Early 2018 I had my first real intro to Buddhism in a Tibetan-Mahayana retreat. I took the first 4 precepts on that first retreat. Since then I have read commentaries, suttas, prioritized all my me-time for "practice" and retreats. My life became only more peaceful and at-ease with time. I have not had a teacher, except for the (group) retreats. I moved to Theravada readings because they were a smaller set of texts than Mahayana. Being an Indian atheist, I have always distrusted prayer, worship, rituals, guru-devotion etc. That helped me move faster, cut thru the fluff of Buddhism, on the path.

# TIMELINE:

Early Mar '22 I experienced complete dis-enchantment from all media. I simply stopped taking any pleasure in movies, TV-shows, music, etc. I was never into social-media anyway. End-Feb '22, during regular sitting meditations, I had gone from access-concentration to "J1" - once. I tried to regain the experience but failed; but I was not that crazy for it. I was practicing some moment-to-moment concentration too, around that time. All this, while listening and reading sutta-commentaries and contemplating.

April-July of '22 - I was fortunate to find solitude and I spent time contemplating and mediating. It was not planned, but it just happened; away from family and friends.

Soon, I lost fear of death, sickness, old-age; fear of seeing loved-ones getting hurt. I lost longing for company, friends, money, possessions, travel, adventure. I became dis-passionate but my life was more vibrant!

Oct '22 I fell ill with a combo of Dengue + Chikv infection - painful, nearly hospitalized; it took 4-6 months to get back on my feet, to go out for a walk in the park again; it took an year to recover my formal strength. But all through the illness and its after-effects, there was no mental suffering. The second-arrow had (has) completely vanished for me, along with FOMO and regrets.

The key thing I had understood in early Mar '22 was Karma and the 4NT (to some extent) - that that is the ultimate truth, and hence the only thing that matters in life. This led me to break-free from all conceptual attachments and cravings. Since then I have had no trouble keeping precept #7 perpetually. In later 2022, I also stopped keeping my journal that I had kept for 25 years - because it felt meaningless to record stuff about myself; past does not matter. The backups also do not matter anymore - emails, photos, videos, memories. In the here-and-now, none of that matters!

# PRECEPTS:

I have kept the 5 precepts for many years now through my adulthood. Last offenses:

P1 2014 or 2015 when I drowned a captured rat. I have slapped mosquitoes to death until 2021 or so.

P2 Nothing from any person that I can remember. From my corporate employer - a $100 item - in 2014

P3 Never

P4 Never, I think

P5 2014 - I was drunk on that last occasion and I vividly remember a very over-whelming sense of restraint for my words and actions while being drunk

P6 began as Intermittent Fasting (IF) in 2018 for health-reasons. Currently I generally eat only in a 4-5 hour window during the day. I do experience, and give-in to, food cravings - but I am aware of my actions. In social settings (though I avoid in general) I dont mind breaking fast. Also, I am not hung-up upon WHICH 4-5 hour-window in the day - we have a cook for the family and HER timings decide what hours I keep :)  not the noon-sun. I consume non-veg now and then; I am mindful of my consumption (and not just about food)

P7 kept it since 2022 as noted above. The interest in media disappeared once I had a clear understanding of what to prioritize in my life, what was really important. This had happened earlier too - once I understood that, physically, the time-travel cannot happen backwards in time, I lost interest in all the movies with time-travel tropes! (The only kind possible is the one shown in Intersteller - IMO)

I was floored watching Dune-1 in theaters - but when Dune-2 came out, I had no interest in it. The fantasies and folklores have lost meaning (and my interest) - what does it matter? I have understood what the most important thing is there to be understood; the only thing that matters. Even concepts - rebirth, bardo, realms - what do they matter - if they are not manifest in the here and now - why bother?

I do watch shows/movies with kids; my Dharma-teachings to my kids are all based on the shows and movies that they watch. There are characters and situations to exemplify and teach about wholesomeness vs un-wholesomeness. Music - sometimes listen to Kabir bhajans or Sufi music that now bear very clear meaning; they are a good reminder to practice, and also, WHY do we practice.

I am not the socializing-type; no need to dress-up.

P8 I have been a green-minimalist since 2014. I do not have much money for luxuries - just enough for kids' education. I am content with simple-living.

Solitude - I have very few friends IRL. I have almost always enjoyed solitude.

# CELIBACY & VIPASSANA:

I was last intimate in early 2019. But still, Celibacy has been the toughest battle. Its the fap - purely mental indulgence; not breaking #3. The longest I have kept celibacy is 3 months. That happened right after my first Goenka Vipassana retreat in Sep '23. I was thrilled upon realizing that the thoughts had "vanished" because of Vipassana; that I was no longer susceptible! The illusion was broken in 3 months - HH was right and I am still liable to be over-powered by craving - esp this particular type. I have tried to explain away the reasons - like "not enough of my past karma has been washed away" and that "more scanning" will help :)

BTW, I had no trouble reaching full-body dissolution in my 1st Goenka retreat. Now I know its only because I have kept sila for a long time. I did not give much importance to experiences that arose - knowing well that I cannot get it on-demand. The lack of control over manifesting - is strongly tied to my understanding of Karma ca. 2022.

I went to my second Goenka retreat in March '24 - hungering for solitude. It brought immense peace, like last time. Good vibrations too :)  But on the final night, after I had been relieved from the precepts - the fap happened. That put me in deeper self-doubt. If I were a stream-enterer (or nearly there), how come I dont have "good self-control", why do I "get angry" at times? Why can I not "keep mindfulness of body/breath 24x7"?

# JHANA:

June '24 I had some me-time and I started listening to Rob Burbea's Jhana instructions. I had achieved Kundalini-awakening in May '23 with those instructions. This time around, it was quite easy for me to get to J1 - or what I have discerned to be the 1st Jhana - I do not really care if it is "defined as" or "really is" J1 or not. I was/am able to get that feeling almost any time in any posture - let go of stress, mental-activity, and I breathe - and the spark is there. This is different from manifesting a pleasant state, its more like relaxing and letting-go; letting-go, not reaching-for.

As of late June my '24 sitting-meditation, vipassana etc. stopped altogether - because of no solitude in early-hours. I was curious of the "withdrawl symptoms". Keeping awareness of the 5 aggregates and contemplation have continued without break all the time - as I dont need me-time/solitude for that.

Finally I got curious again of my spiritual-state, started digging into Samandipa and HH videos and looking up the definition and progress thru the fetters. It made sense and this is the post about it.

# CURRENT STATUS:

I am ok. Nothing special to do except take on the challenges of a householder, one day at a time until the kids mature into adulthood. And then I will seek a formal teacher, solitude, jhanas, etc.

Regardless, I just keep awareness of my 5 aggregates, sometimes contemplate; chop-wood-carry-water.

edit: formatting

edit: celibacy - last date early 2019

edit: current status: I am not looking to progress to/in jhanas or in vipassana. I dont have the time in my family life - as of now. It has been very hard to make 10 days of time for retreats in a nuclear-family with kids. The retreats have always been helpful to me - but they are not "it" - thats the realization I have tried to capture in my OP.

    Since you mentioned you are open to contemplating replies to your post:

    > While I had myself suspected to have attained the first fruit, I have not been sure about what made it click for me 

    That's would simply not be possible if it actually were the fruit of stream entry. "Shifts of view" and "transformational insights" are just that, not stream entry, and the contemporary idea of "fruition" that's implied in the post is a misinterpretation of how the word *phala* is used in the Suttas. 

    People think that a "fruition experience" is what makes one a sotāpanna, which naturally leads to this "I know it, but I can't explain it" idea.

    This flies in the face of the whole reasoning behind the simile of the axe handle: you can't not know what caused the axe handle to wear away if you actually wore it away, because it would've been you yourself, with your own hands, grabbing it and swinging it millions of times. In that timespan, there would be dozens of "shifts" and "insights" even more profound than what you describe, and none of them are *sotāpatti* yet.

    >But all through the illness and its after-effects, there was no mental suffering. The second-arrow had (has) completely vanished for me

    That doesn't mean the second arrow has vanished. That's a common point of confusion. It simply means that, probably due to the mental fortitude and stability created by your virtue and restraint, and maybe some degree of innate toughness, *there was no arrow to begin with*. Freedom from the second arrow is way more profound than that: it's not being touched by *arisen* mental suffering, regardless of how intense it is.

### I Still Don't Understand about Sotapanna

Hi brothers and sisters in dhamma. Sometime ago another member of this subreddit made a post about the suffering of Sotapnna, I read the thread and I saw how Bhikku Anigha gave very interesting answer and it leads to me having more question.

>

So, **in comparison** to one's *puthujjana* state (since you can only ever speak in relative terms; there is no unit of measurement for feelings), a *sotāpanna* feels effectively nothing, because that ever-present second arrow that was always 99% of all the suffering the *puthujjana* experienced is completely gone. The first arrow is nothing compared to that. And, as some Suttas say, Nibbāna is where nothing is felt, and *that* is pleasant.

>...............................  
And yes, adding just "seven grains" to the experience of an Arahant is enough to be able to cry like Ānanda, and to be overwhelmed with sexual desire like Vaṅgīsa. Still, experientially speaking, although it might look the same externally, that *is* effectively nothing compared to the suffering of a puthujjana. Even in those absolute rock-bottom moments, it's all just the first arrow.

Bhikku Anigha said this, but also, in different answer he said this.

> That's why many *sotāpannas* in the Suttas could become quite heedless, to the point that, on top of not ordaining, they would continue to lead a normal householder's life and not be celibate.

I am wondering, if Sotpanna's 2nd arrow is 99 percent gone, how can they not be automatically celibate?? Doesn't the absence of second arrow means they wouldnt have the craving to "scratch the itch" in lots of types of pleasure, and also mean they should be automatically celibate??

I hope Bhikku Anigha can give answers, and you guys who are more experienced can also give me your opinion.

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1f9hffn/i_still_dont_understand_about_sotapanna/llnvrup/)** _2024-09-05 17:51:09_:

    >Doesn't the absence of second arrow means they wouldnt have the craving to "scratch the itch" in lots of types of pleasure, and also mean they should be automatically celibate??

    It means that they're incapable of experiencing the "itch" in the way a puthujjana does, but it doesn't mean that they will never scratch it.

    As the Arrow Sutta says, the puthujjana knows no other escape from pain than sensual pleasure—any pleasure that is bound with attachment and depends on circumstances, and that includes things like career, friends, hobbies, and also meditation for most people—which means that for him, scratching an arisen sensual itch is a matter of existential importance. Not doing so automatically means being crushed by his own mind. He might become skilled at *preventing the itch from arising* (which is what is commonly regarded as "meditation"), but if and when it arises, he's completely cornered.

    A noble disciple, since he does understand the true escape from all suffering, would engage in sensuality simply out of habit and laziness. He would not be troubled if he had no access to sensual pleasure when the itch arises.

    Because of that, that itch can never have the threatening, commanding quality that it has for the puthujjana, even if it gets quite intense at times and he gives in to it.

    Also, owing to his understanding of all craving as suffering, a sotāpanna can't possibly hold the view that sensuality is somehow beneficial, acceptable, justified, or excusable, regardless of the circumstances. When he does give in to it, it's out of pure weakness. 

    But a puthujjana is able to—and most often will—hold the view that engaging in sensuality *can* be beneficial because he doesn't see the danger in it, let alone in *upādāna* generally.

### To what extent should "I" assume responsibility for phenomena arising in my experience?

When I can sense my mind in an unwholesome state (e.g., lust, anger, laziness, and so on), to what extent should I assume responsibility for causing to arise vs perceiving it as "un-ownable"?  Or perhaps is responsibility for vs un-ownable different things, or is this altogether a wrong line of questioning?

For example, suppose lust arises in the mind.  Even though I have been practicing/guarding my sense doors, its having arisen could be due to

1. just the natural remnants of an untrained mind becoming more tame,
2. I haven't been guarding my senses careful enough,
3. I still see value in sensuality, or
4. some other causal factor I haven't figured out yet.

It seems to me that option #1 should assumed only if all of the other options have not be thoroughly investigated and confirmed to not be the cause.

On a meta level, I'm also trying to reconcile "I am the owner of my actions" (kammassakomhi) with avoiding the wrong view of ownership over one's senses (more specifically, the contents of one's sensory experience).  Apologies in advance if I have butchered the paraphrasing.

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1f89y5q/to_what_extent_should_i_assume_responsibility_for/llgm0qi/)** _2024-09-04 13:07:55_:

    Whenever you intentionally break a precept or fail to exercise restraint, that in itself should be regarded as an act of taking ownership of your experience. The emphasis should be on preventing the transgression from recurring, not in trying to wriggle out of the remorse by re-framing it in light of the "Dhamma" of not-self, etc. [The sense of shame and fear of wrongdoing is the precursor to wholesome states](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an10.105).

    Although virtue alone is not the Dhamma, there cannot be Dhamma (non-ownership) apart from virtue.

    But if you know that you have been restrained and keeping your precepts, you are alone in seclusion, and aren’t doing anything unwholesome at the time, *then* you are in a position to try to understand what is left over as not yours.

### Do we have control over "wanting of the wanting"?

https://youtu.be/_ttVxzlzlj0?si=IoAf5KlD_GzN8V0N

In this video, Ajahn discusses the wanting of wanting of sensual objects. 

If the wanting is there on it's own, out of my control, phenomena enduring there by itself, what is it that makes "wanting of the wanting" something different from that? Isn't that also a phenomena that I'm subject to/secondary to and is out of my control? 

I have a similar question about upadana. Is upadana a phenomena (Dhamma)? What did the Buddha mean when he said "upadana is not in the five aggregates, nor is it apart from them." As I currently understand, the five aggregates is the totality of my experience. If that's the case, how can upadana be apart from the aggregates/how can it not be a phenomena?



- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1f2jyr4/do_we_have_control_over_wanting_of_the_wanting/lkai18e/)** _2024-08-28 04:16:56_:

    >what is it that makes "wanting of the wanting" something different from that?

    One of them is a mental state, the other is your volition in regard to that mental state. You can say that your volition is also a phenomenon, but if you say that it's not in your control, you fall into denial of *kamma*, which is a textbook wrong view.

    >As I currently understand, the five aggregates is the totality of my experience. If that's the case, how can upadana be apart from the aggregates/how can it not be a phenomena?

    You can't look at it from a purely theoretical point of view, as if you could describe your experience objectively. The ordinary person cannot see the totality of their experience even when they try to think about it, and thus, *upādāna,* even though technically it's also a phenomenon within that experience, is not so ***for them***. For them, since *upādāna* is not seen, it *is* "outside,"  even though that's technically impossible. [That's why it's said that the defilements are gratuitous, and the mind itself is radiant](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an1.51-60#an1.51:1.1-an1.51:1.4), which doesn't mean we're "already enlightened" or similar; without a great deal of effort, defilements will remain indefinitely. The intrinsic "radiance" simply means that enlightenment is always *possible* to develop.

    Once you do get to see the totality of your experience (which is what an unwavering commitment to virtue and sense restraint gradually achieves), and *upādāna* can be recognized as a phenomenon, it automatically ceases to be there. It's something that can only operate in the dark, unseen.

    >Take an unlearned ordinary person who has not seen the noble ones, and is neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve not seen true persons, and are neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the true persons.

    >They regard form \[feeling, etc.\] as self. But that regarding is an activity. [\[1\]](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=sn22.81#comment1) And what’s the foundation, origin, birthplace, and source of that activity? For an unlearned ordinary person, struck by feelings born of ignorance-contact, craving has arisen. That activity is born from that. So that activity is impermanent, determined, and dependently originated. [\[2\]](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=sn22.81#comment2) And that craving, that feeling, that contact, and that ignorance are also impermanent, determined, and dependently originated. For one who knows and sees in this way, bhikkhus, there is **immediate destruction of the influxes.**

### Magga & Phala, Right View, Stream Entry and faith/dhamma followers - regarding recent events

What if we take the interpretation that Right View is something different from Stream Entry?
Hear my out here.

Often times in the suttas getting right view and stream entry seems to go hand in hand, mainly after certain individuals with the necessary preconditions heard a discourse from the Buddha.

Yet there is also this certain very elusive category of faith & dhamma followers, those on the path (magga) and striving for stream entry, but having not yet achieved the fruit (phala)(stream entry).

They seem to inhabit certain ariyan qualities which make them destined to achieve stream entry at their death, when they can no longer postone the pratice.

What if we say that this category has "Right View" but they haven't reached stream entry yet. This would enable them to for example teach others, even reduce their suffering somewhat, without having "seen" the path for themselves.

An example of such an individual in the suttas might have been the heavy drinker Sarakāni, who due to his negligence in sense restraint could not attain stream entry but possed enough confidence and wisdom to possess Right View. I have attached the sutta SN 55.24 at the bottom of this post.
My theory is that most of *serious* practitioners are like Sarakāni, due to having been born in the current age of sense indulgence.

I am quite curious about what Bhikku Anigha and Keller Dellinger might think of this interpretation. Essentially this would mean that a number of us may be considered noble in the broadest sense of having the right view, but not in the strictest sense of having completed the path to stream entry trough perfected virtue. 

(One may not know themselves to be a faith/dhamma followerer, hence why people came up to the buddha and asked about it.
Stream Entry in contrast is definitely noticeable, since your entire perspective gets turned upside down.)

I basically propose that the faith/dhamma followers have Right View but not the fruit of Stream entry, and that these terms are often used synonymously because they can happen in quick succession/simultaneously.  Hence the confusion about such an elusive term.




The sutta reference:
SN 55.24 Paṭhamasaraṇānisakkasutta: About Sarakāni (1st) (Translation by Bhikku Sujato)

At Kapilavatthu.

Now at that time Sarakāni the Sakyan had passed away. The Buddha declared that he was a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening.

At that, several Sakyans came together complaining, grumbling, and objecting, “Oh, how incredible, how amazing! Who can’t become a stream-enterer these days? For the Buddha even declared Sarakāni to be a stream-enterer after he passed away. Sarakāni was too weak for the training; he used to drink alcohol.”

Then Mahānāma the Sakyan went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. The Buddha said:

“Mahānāma, when a lay follower has for a long time gone for refuge to the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha, how could they go to the underworld? And if anyone should rightly be said to have for a long time gone for refuge to the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha, it’s Sarakāni the Sakyan. Sarakāni the Sakyan has for a long time gone for refuge to the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha. How could he go to the underworld?

Take a certain person who has experiential confidence in the Buddha … the teaching … the Saṅgha … They have laughing wisdom and swift wisdom, and are endowed with freedom. They’ve realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements. This person is exempt from hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm. They’re exempt from places of loss, bad places, the underworld.

Take another person who has experiential confidence in the Buddha … the teaching … the Saṅgha … They have laughing wisdom and swift wisdom, but are not endowed with freedom. With the ending of the five lower fetters they’re reborn spontaneously. They are extinguished there, and are not liable to return from that world. This person, too, is exempt from hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm. They’re exempt from places of loss, bad places, the underworld.

Take another person who has experiential confidence in the Buddha … the teaching … the Saṅgha … But they don’t have laughing wisdom or swift wisdom, nor are they endowed with freedom. With the ending of three fetters, and the weakening of greed, hate, and delusion, they’re a once-returner. They come back to this world once only, then make an end of suffering. This person, too, is exempt from hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm. They’re exempt from places of loss, bad places, the underworld.

Take another person who has experiential confidence in the Buddha … the teaching … the Saṅgha … But they don’t have laughing wisdom or swift wisdom, nor are they endowed with freedom. With the ending of three fetters they’re a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening. This person, too, is exempt from hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm. They’re exempt from places of loss, bad places, the underworld.

Take another person who doesn’t have experiential confidence in the Buddha … the teaching … the Saṅgha … They don’t have laughing wisdom or swift wisdom, nor are they endowed with freedom. Still, they have these qualities: the faculties of faith, energy, mindfulness, immersion, and wisdom. And they accept the teachings proclaimed by the Realized One after deliberating them with a degree of wisdom. This person, too, doesn’t go to hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm. They don’t go to places of loss, bad places, the underworld.

Take another person who doesn’t have experiential confidence in the Buddha … the teaching … the Saṅgha … They don’t have laughing wisdom or swift wisdom, nor are they endowed with freedom. Still, they have these qualities: the faculties of faith, energy, mindfulness, immersion, and wisdom. And they have a degree of faith and love for the Buddha. This person, too, doesn’t go to hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm. They don’t go to places of loss, bad places, the underworld.

### Another yoniso manisikara question...

So it was thinking. What is the existential manifestation of yoniso manisikara? So I thought let's say I have the hinderance of remorse arise I have two smoke a cigarette or don't smoke and just endure it the way it's supposed to be endured (from the not personal point of view which can be bodily activity)... so sister medhini said in a video before that a non sensual thought is the thought of the danger of sensuality. As in the good thought is manifested negatively not as an object you can attend to.

So I was thinking yoniso may not be so different. 

Back to the example. A hinderance has arisen, I know if I cover it up il I won't address the issue I would just be putting my attention somewhere else( attending things unfit for attention) so instead I know the arisen hinderance and pressure to get rid of it I don't give in because I know this is not the escape. Then since trying to cover it up is not escape would restraint be the stepping outside while inside.

    >A hinderance has arisen, I know if I cover it up il I won't address the issue I would just be putting my attention somewhere else( attending things unfit for attention) so instead I know the arisen hinderance and pressure to get rid of it I don't give in because I know this is not the escape.

    Yes, that's right. It usually helps to make some effort to remind yourself about the danger in taking the bait, but at the end of the day, the "meat" of *yoniso manasikāra* is in the simple resolve not to perform the unwholesome action, while also not trying to remove the pressure if it has arisen. Hence, you're already practicing a degree of *yoniso manasikāra* if you really make sure to keep the precepts unbroken (without resorting to a calming technique), whereas figuring out all the details of how to practice it but not actually keeping the precepts would hardly bring you any closer.

### A Sotāpanna's Suffering

Hello everyone!

There was a certain passage in Keller's [recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1eylaun/i_am_a_puthujjana/) that got me interested in writing this post. It is this one:

>Bhante continued on to explain that this lack of suffering experienced by a sotāpanna is the exact same as that lack of suffering experienced by an arahant: that they **feel nothing**. Or, at least, that they feel nothing regarding any pressure coming from the first three fetters which, if we take the himalaya mountain/seven grains of sand analogy seriously, means they do truly feel effectively nothing. 

I am wondering how the statement that a *sekha* feels nothing can be squared with the description of Ānanda's grieving on account of the Buddha's imminent passing in the Mahāparinibbāna-sutta, DN 16:

>Then the Venerable Ānanda, entering the dwelling, leaned on the lintel and stood crying: 'And I am only a trainee, who still has his task (ahead), and there will be the final extinguishment of my teacher, who is one compassionate towards me.'

>*atha kho āyasmā ānando vihāraṃ pavisitvā kapisīsaṃ ālambitvā rodamāno aṭṭhāsi — “ahañca vatamhi sekho sakaraṇīyo, satthu ca me parinibbānaṃ bhavissati, yo mama anukampako”ti.*

Could someone who feels nothing become so visibly overcome with grief? Or should we interpret this as feeling nothing "regarding any pressure coming from the first three fetters"?

The analogy of "the seven stone fragments the size of mustard seeds" (*satta sāsapamattiyo pāsāṇasakkharā,* SN 56.59/60) compared to the Himālaya is actually about the *dukkha* of the seven more existences that remain for a *sotāpanna,* which the [sutta](https://suttacentral.net/sn56.60/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=sidebyside&reference=main&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin) explicitly states. That the term *sattakkattuparamatā* 'the fact of seven times at most' refers indeed to what is commonly called "rebirth" can perhaps best be seen from [AN 3.88](https://suttacentral.net/an3.88/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=sidebyside&reference=main&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin) and [AN 9.12](https://suttacentral.net/an9.12/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=sidebyside&reference=main&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin), referring to the (first type of) *sotāpanna*:

>Through the wearing away of three fetters, he is one of seven times at most. Having run on, having wandered on seven times at most towards gods and humans he makes an end to suffering.

>*so tiṇṇaṃ saṃyojanānaṃ parikkhayā sattakkhattuparamo hoti. sattakkhattuparamaṃ deve ca manusse ca sandhāvitvā saṃsaritvā dukkhassantaṃ karoti.*

Based on that, the simile is actually inadequate to be used for the suffering that still remains for a *sotāpanna* in their present existence.

Again, it is not my intention to be dismissive of anyone, or wanting to criticize for its own sake. Only I feel that these two points do not fully hold against the suttas.

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1ezf1p7/a_sotāpannas_suffering/ljntada/)** _2024-08-24 04:50:22_:

    Based on that simile alone, yes, it might seem like a *sotāpanna* experiences largely the same suffering as a puthujjana, just that the amount of it is limited to the remainder of seven lives.

    But see the [Arrow Sutta](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=sn36.6), particularly the following lines:

    >In the same way, a learned noble disciple, when struck by unpleasant feeling, doesn’t sorrow, wail, lament, beat their breast or become muddled. They feel one feeling: one bodily, and none pertaining to the *citta*.  
    ...  
    If they feel a pleasant feeling, they feel it unyoked. If they feel an unpleasant feeling, they feel it unyoked. If they feel a neither-pleasant-nor-unpleasant feeling, they feel it unyoked.

    >This is called a learned noble disciple who is **unyoked from birth, old age, and death, from sorrows, lamentations, pains, dissatisfactions, and tribulations; who is unyoked from suffering, I say.**

    >...  
    One who understands and is learned **does not feel a feeling**  
    **of pleasure or unpleasure.**  
    This is the great distinction  
    between the wise and skilled, and the ordinary person.

    It's a grave but common mistake to think that a *puthujjana* can at times not experience the second arrow. The reality is that, as the Sutta says, whenever they experience displeasure, the second arrow is inevitably there.

    So, **in comparison** to one's *puthujjana* state (since you can only ever speak in relative terms; there is no unit of measurement for feelings), a *sotāpanna* feels effectively nothing, because that ever-present second arrow that was always 99% of all the suffering the *puthujjana* experienced is completely gone. The first arrow is nothing compared to that. And, as some Suttas say, Nibbāna is where nothing is felt, and *that* is pleasant. A *sotāpanna* abides in Nibbāna to the degree that they have realized the third noble truth.

    Of course, once you actually become a *sotāpanna,* the suffering that's left does feel excessive because now that's all you have, and that remainder would motivate you to strive further. But if you don't draw that clear distinction between the feelings of *puthujjana* and *sotāpanna*, you end up with the common case of a *puthujjana* who gained some special ["insight"](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn29#mn29:5.1-mn29:5.24) and now assumes himself to have the Right View, while in the end still being liable to the second arrow (though they may not notice it due to lack of self-transparency, and increased virtue, sense restraint, and commitment to Dhamma in general).

    It can be compared to someone who still experiences minor lingering symptoms from a deadly illness that they were already cured of. The fact of the matter is, even if at times the symptoms they experience are *more* intense and physically painful than those of a person who's still ill and may die at any moment from the disease, they will never be the felt the same way. The ill person's palpable symptoms may be less or even none, in fact, but the real pain they are perpetually subject to stems from the fact that they're trapped by and cannot escape that illness that will kill them sooner or later. The particular symptoms are just the cherry on the cake when they show up.

    It's also important to clarify that "not feeling anything" doesn't mean what people usually understand by that. There's lots of puthujjanas who "don't not feel anything", but out of sheer indolence, dullness, and apathy, which is emphatically not what Nibbāna is. "Not feeling anything" in this right sense is a result of the absence of ignorance, and not of becoming a lifeless rock. On many occasions, the Buddha himself alluded to how he experienced not just physical pleasure and pain, but also mental happiness and mental discomfort.

    And yes, adding just "seven grains" to the experience of an Arahant is enough to be able to cry like Ānanda, and to be overwhelmed with sexual desire like Vaṅgīsa. Still, experientially speaking, although it might look the same externally, that *is* effectively nothing compared to the suffering of a puthujjana. Even in those absolute rock-bottom moments, it's all just the first arrow.

    That sounds confusing and somewhat paradoxical, but it's not supposed to make sense from a *puthujjana's* perspective. If it does, and you're still a *puthujjana*, you should be concerned. The Dhamma is "beyond reasoning" (*atakkāvacara),* and can only be experienced by the wise for themselves.

    So, whichever way we wish to interpret the simile of the seven grains of sand, it's not seven more existences of more or less the same feelings that you know now as a *puthujjana. Sotāpannas* have only seven existences left not because of a cosmic decree, but because *internally*, that's how little potential for being is left in them (and it may be even less, since it's not that every sotāpanna has to have 7 more existences). So *both* the limited amount of reappearances in the future and the limited amount of suffering in the present are byproducts of the same internal development that makes them, from a *puthujjana*'s point of view, be free from suffering.

### Rebirth, Kamma, and what is even the point?

Early on in my Buddhist practice, the teachings on non-self, rebirth, and kamma were something I easily accepted. Perhaps because I came from a non-religious background so did not have an opposing world view to counter those teachings.

But recently, the more I think about these things, it makes me wonder what is even the point of attaining enlightenment, and if enlightenment is even a reality. It's my understanding that kamma is an energy that moves through samsara and we are all basically manifestations of that, but are not real beings with souls. So, are we individual "packages" of kamma, or are we even less of actual beings than that? It makes me wonder, if I will not remember this life, because I do not remember past lives, and I can not conceive of or see my future lives, then what is even the point of working towards enlightenment?

I hear teachings from some monks and they're like, "do you really want to go through the pain of living and growing up and loss all over again?" - but this question does not really make sense because if I have a future life, it will seem then like it's my first go around. Can someone please help put this all into perspective, because I'm feeling a little bit lost in my confidence in the Buddha's teachings as of late. Especially over the last few days since coming to question my practice of meditation. I feel like that was a core part of my practice.

  
Also I'm watching this and it's bringing up a lot of questions

    >It's my understanding that kamma is an energy that moves through samsara and we are all basically manifestations of that, but are not real beings with souls. So, are we individual "packages" of kamma, or are we even less of actual beings than that?

    Most of the information you will find on rebirth and kamma doesn't accord with the Suttas.

    This sort of view is very common, and it gives people a sense that from their present position, with an untrained mind, they can already make sense of what the Buddha was pointing to with the teaching of *anattā*. But there is no mention of such a doctrine, or anything that resembles it, anywhere in the Suttas. It's certainly influenced by the Abhidhammic analysis of experience as an ever-flowing sequence of mental events, each one conditioned by previous ones, because of which "there is no real being there".

    In fact, whenever the Buddha would recount one of his previous lives, he would say ["I myself was such and such at that time"](https://suttacentral.net/dn17/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=main&notes=none&highlight=false&script=latin#2.14.3).

    The Dhamma is something that "can only be seen by the wise for themselves", and so it cannot be accurately conveyed through such theoretical, explanatory views that a scientist would "agree" with and that don't require any practice to comprehend.

    >It makes me wonder, if I will not remember this life, because I do not remember past lives, and I can not conceive of or see my future lives, then what is even the point of working towards enlightenment?

    If someone comes and tells you, "I'll beat you up tomorrow, and you'll forget what happened today as well as the beat-up itself, but you'll still have the bruises and broken bones the day after and beyond", is there any point in saying no? There is nothing more esoteric about going from one life to another than going from today to tomorrow. The only significant difference is the presence of memories of what came before, but as shown by the example I gave, the absence of memories doesn't allow you to pretend in good faith that what comes later is not your problem. The fruits of your actions will still have to be experienced, and they will still hurt just as much.

    If there were no rebirth, then indeed there would be point in enlightenment. It would just be a sensual goal of getting more pleasure and avoiding pain, for no particular reason, given that you could just end it all right now without having to bother with any practice.

    But if you realize that you can't possibly prove that there *isn't* rebirth, then, if you're concerned for your own welfare, the goal of liberating your mind from passion in this life does have a valid justification. If you don't do that, and you turn out to be wrong and there *is* rebirth, you're at the mercy of the workings of *kamma* that you can't even comprehend, and you may well not get another chance to rescue yourself for who knows how long. You can assume that you will lose all the experience and knowledge you gained in this life that allowed you to protect yourself from suffering to a great degree. So you can also safely assume that if this human world is anything to go by (and clearly it can be a lot worse if you look at animals), there's a high likelihood that it won't be a fun ride.

### Noting Meditation 

Greetings everyone. Would the Mahasi Sayadaw's meditation technique of mental noting experiences and phenomenon be considered a valid meditation within the framework of what the Buddha himself taught and said about meditation? If so, how? If not, why not? 

I am looking for guidance from the suttas, not so much other people's personal opinions or good or bad experiences with this particular method.

Another thing... I have been listening to talks put out by Hillside Hermitage regarding meditation. I have a rather consistent and solid meditation practice, but am now questioning the techniques and methods I use at times. What do the Noble Ones at Hillside Hermitage recommend as a way of meditation for lay people who keep 5 precepts and celibacy, sometimes all 8 precpets, and are focused on knowing intentions and restraining senses (at the level that sometimes I still mess up, but am constantly reflecting and trying to self correct)?

Thank you all for any input.

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1ewv66l/noting_meditation/lj5sp2n/)** _2024-08-21 04:29:55_:

    Any type of meditation that promises itself to be right while one is a puthujjana is intrinsically wrong, whether it's noting, watching your breath, loving-kindness mantras, or even "choiceless awareness",  simply because it won't push you to become aware of your intentions, which is where craving, the defilements, and everything you actually need to understand lies. Your mind is still subject to greed, aversion, and delusion not because you don't spend enough time "noting" or because the noting hasn't given rise to some special fruition experience, but because you don't sufficiently recognize the degree to which your own intentions, including the intention to practice noting, as well as anything else you do, say, or think, is affected with those defilements.

    >“Sandha, meditate like a thoroughbred, not like a wild colt.

    >And how does a wild colt meditate? A wild colt, tied up by the feeding trough, meditates: ‘Fodder, fodder!’ Why is that? Because it doesn’t occur to the wild colt tied up by the feeding trough: ‘What task will the horse trainer have me do today? How should I respond?’ Tied up by the feeding trough it just meditates: ‘Fodder, fodder!’

    >—AN 11.9

    Instead, you need to operate with the assumption that your own intentions are hiding from you and are sabotaging your efforts for as long as you don't see them fully (i.e., don't yet have the Right View).

    >And how does a thoroughbred meditate? A fine thoroughbred, tied up by the feeding trough, doesn’t meditate: ‘Fodder, fodder!’ Why is that? Because it occurs to the fine thoroughbred tied up by the feeding trough: ‘What task will the horse trainer have me do today? How should I respond?’ Tied up by the feeding trough they don’t meditate: ‘Fodder, fodder!’ For that fine thoroughbred regards the use of the goad as a debt, a bond, a loss, a misfortune.

    When a desire arises to go somewhere, eat something, say something, imagine something, or to practice this or that technique, become aware of *that,* investigate whether it's unskillful (which the last one always is if your goal is to see the four noble truths), don't give in to it if it is, and remain on guard for anything else that might arise. If it's not unskillful, not against the precepts, and doesn't lead to the arising of further defilements internally, you can do it.

    [Whoever has purified their behavior has done it like this](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn61), and not through noting.

### When is it Upekkha and when is it laziness? 

 I've been trying to develop Upekkha, but very often remaining equanimous to certain things has a flavor of just being lazy or of the "it's going to be fine anyway" wrong view. How can I tell the difference between Upekkha and just wishful thinking that everything will be fine? 

 Thank you all!

    > How can I tell the difference between Upekkha and just wishful thinking that everything will be fine? 

    By not trying to "do" what you now think upekkha is, and instead focusing on developing virtue, sense restraint, awareness of your intentions, and becoming a sotāpanna first. That may be a more disquieting endeavor compared to your current idea of equanimity, but is in reality much closer to upekkha.

    Any equanimity you have not based on those prerequisites will be wishful thinking. It will be the equanimity based on the household life and not on renunciation, as the Buddha says in MN 137.

### Restraint and discipline is tiring me?

I've since forever felt this resistance to restraint in my daily life. No matter what it is, "something" starts to feel bad after I've restrained myself for a while. Sometimes, it's to the point that I've felt that I'll die of a heart attack or something.

For example, I'm studying or working on something, and for this, I need to sit on a chair for long hours, with full attentiveness. Let's say at least for four or five hours. I'll naturally start getting restless after half an hour, feeling anxious, etc., so I might have to get up and "walk it off".  This clearly sucks because it's taking me away from deep work, not to mention trapping me with a bad habit of giving in to pressure.

Let's not even talk about other escapes like sexuality, social media, etc. I might be able to ward off for a while, but then I start getting tired from this. Finally, after a point of time, they can easily overpower me.

So starting today, what I can do to improve? How can I stand against the pull of ANY distraction, no matter how tired I feel, which I will invariably face again tomorrow?

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1esyjg6/restraint_and_discipline_is_tiring_me/licut4d/)** _2024-08-16 04:28:10_:

    You shouldn't be worrying about something as minute as an intention to get up and walk if you still break the 8 precepts from time to time. If you do, it's almost guaranteed that you'll be acting from a place of adhering to an arbitrary observance (which is basically what self-mortification is), instead of actually seeing an unwholesome intention and restraining it. That's why[ the Buddha instructed people to train gradually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gBSOK_8fXA) instead of trying to restrain every single unskillful intention right off the bat, which is not possible because you start being able to see only the very coarsest ones, and the subtler ones will be a complete hit-or-miss.

    So what you can do starting today to improve is determine to dial in the very first step: never breaking the 8 precepts again (and that might take a while).  Do your best with all the rest, but don't expect it to be anywhere near perfect before you are accomplished in basic virtue.

### Enduring the pressure correctly

Let's say, as a really simple example, that I am sitting down and not engaging with anything else on an external level.  Just sitting still, that's it.  And then, I have a really strong urge to stand up.  I'm using this example because it's so simple, this could equally apply to more coarse situations like an urge to smoke cigarettes.

In this situation, I am guaranteed to be experiencing an unpleasant SENSATION of pressure.  I am also probably going to have thoughts ringing out that are trying to push me towards action in one direction or another.  Now, this all kind of reminds me of an example I read on here recently, where Venerable Nanavira was speaking about his experience quitting cigarettes.  He mentions how, after quitting, he quickly found himself thinking "I know I can stick to my resolve not to smoke again, but I really need to smoke another cigarette to be sure this is the right way to go."  Similarly, I often find myself in a situation like this, where a pressure is occurring, I know that I just need to not follow the obvious direction it is trying to take me, and that's all that I need to be *doing.*  Hence, if I just keep sitting down and that's  my only external action, in the case where the urge is to stand up, then I can kind of rest easy knowing that I'm legitimately enduring the pressure correctly.

Now here's where it gets confusing to me. Sometimes, I experience a more ambiguous type of pressure, it doesn't have clear directionality, but it's just saying that I need to do something\*.\*  There are two questions that I have about this:

1. Is it true to say that the perceived directionality is because of thinking and pondering related to the pressure?  As in, I am connecting two unconnected domains, and believing that the thoughts related to the pressure are actually related to it, when they actually aren't?  For instance, if you have an itch, your natural inclination is to scratch it.  But what if your natural inclination was to jump up and down, thinking that was the best solution -- you'd never even thought of scratching in the first place, just jumping.  It's the same itch, but "acting out" or going with the grain seems to take two different forms depending on your perception of it, which is formed by thought.
2. Experientially, is it true that I should just remain aware of the whole experience, not even just the pressure, but certainly not without the pressure I know is there, and not do anything else?  It seems like that is ultimately the best thing I can do when I'm under pressure to act out of unwholesome.  I keep finding myself feeling so overwhelmed because I'm not sure whether I'm just implicitly acting out by having xyz thoughts, or what even directly constitutes acting out at all.  This is especially difficult when I consider point 1, which posits that there may be no real directionality at all, so "acting out" would simply mean doing anything with the intention to distract yourself from the pressure.  
3. One thing I have contemplated for a while is that, given that the entire body(1) (and hence, my body(2) experience as a whole -- using the terminology bhante Anigha used in his Yoniso Manasikhara essay, where body(1) is the more fundamental object in the world) is subject to death and thus directly unownable, it is possible that no thinking and pondering, no sensations, nothing on that body(2) level can actually be my action on an immediate level, my action is something that comes *after* that.  But does it have to be volitional?  On what level do I *choose* to make this or that action, what is the threshold?  So is it just that assumption or ayoniso attention that turns natural thinking and pondering into the *act* of thinking and pondering?  Or is it that, since you implicitly can say no to thoughts, can turn your direction elsewhere, you are acting simply by experiencing them?  Without understanding the line of action more clearly, I'm having a lot of trouble enduring the hindrances, even though I see how terrible and often unbearable the pressure of sensuality actually is.  It really is exactly like racketeering, it's honestly very horrific because pretty much every single thing I habitually "want" to do has this exact same dynamic, this exact same pressure underlying it.  It's like my world is made of sharp stones.

To rephrase what I said above - when I'm met with an unpleasant abiding, I know that it's wrong to act towards ignoring it or trying to get rid of it.  What happens is that since I don't understand the line between acting and not acting with enough clarity, my ability to endure without actually acting chips away as the perception that I am implicitly acting out due to the arising of phenomena grows stronger.  If I had to guess, I would say that perhaps I just need to endure that too, and I'm still not acting out until I make a conscious choice.  But I could easily be wrong.

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1esp5sp/enduring_the_pressure_correctly/licrph3/)** _2024-08-16 04:03:13_:

    It sounds like you're severely overthinking things and are not realizing that you've already gone down the rabbit hole of restlessness and doubt. Even if the ideas you arrive at are theoretically correct, they won't be so *internally* because they're coming through a mind of doubt.

    What you should do is not try to stop feeling the pressure or stop thinking, but see the whole barrage of doubts, uncertainties, and questions that present themselves as being of the utmost importance as *one thing* that's trying to bait you away from the right context, and then let that pressure endure for as long as it wants without going out to welcome it *or* fight with it at any point.

### Logic behind restraint and non-restraint

I've heard multiple times that giving into craving further perpetuates it. Why is that the case? I understand that intuitively through empirical observations, but there's still a sense of doubt with regards to it. Also, is abstinence supposed to naturally ward off the craving? Similarly, why?

Say there's a pleasant prospect present, the recognition of that prospect is felt unpleasantly and there is resistance towards it naturally; i.e., there is a sense of "I want to go towards that thing" either physically or mentally. What is right endurance here? What makes that endurance "right" as opposed to other kinds of endurances?

    >Also, is abstinence supposed to naturally ward off the craving? Similarly, why?

    Not in itself, because in the end abstinence always pertains only to specific things. You can move your craving away from specific things simply by abstaining from them, but that's not the Dhamma yet, that's just virtue, and craving would still linger on a deeper level that may not be blatantly reflected by your actions.

    What abstinence does is "contain" craving, which is the stepping stone for discerning it, and only once you discern it can you truly destroy it. If you live perfectly restrained but assume that's all you need to do, you won't be looking further for the actual *root* of those things that you abstain from.

    >Say there's a pleasant prospect present, the recognition of that prospect is felt unpleasantly and there is resistance towards it naturally; i.e., there is a sense of "I want to go towards that thing" either physically or mentally. What is right endurance here? What makes that endurance "right" as opposed to other kinds of endurances?

    Endurance becomes "right" when it's done from the understanding that the way you feel is not the issue, but rather the impulse to *act* out of the way you feel. The rightness or wrongness is not determined by what you do.

    So for example, the severe fasting some ascetics in the Buddha's time did is not in itself wrong. The problem is that more often than not the view behind it is that you’ve developed your mind when you no longer perceive the hunger and discomfort anymore, almost like some sort of soldier.

    But the person practicing right endurance sees the problem as the fact that their mind is affected by (= wants to act out of) the physical and emotional unpleasantness of abstinence, as opposed to whether the abstinence itself is unpleasant. So if someone is abstaining from some unwholesome action and is in terrible emotional distress on account of it, there is no problem at all for as long as they're not doing anything by body, speech, or mind to alleviate that discomfort (which includes telling themselves to "endure it" with the hope that it will subside).

    And that's the type of endurance that develops your mind so that nothing can ever overpower it, without needing to manage the way you feel about anything. In other words, it's not about *not being challenged* by things, but about not craving no matter how intense the challenge is. The former can be achieved through sheer willpower, the latter can only ever arise from wisdom.

    >“Suppose, friend, there was a stone pillar eight meters long. Four meters would be below ground and four meters above ground. If a violent rainstorm should then arrive from the east, it would not shake it or make it quake, wobble, and tremble; if a violent rainstorm should then arrive from the west … from the north … from the south, it would not shake it or make it quake, wobble, and tremble. For what reason? Because the stone pillar is deep in the ground and is securely planted. So too, friend, when a bhikkhu is thus perfectly liberated in mind, even if powerful forms cognizable by the eye come into range of the eye … Even if powerful phenomena cognizable by the mind come into range of the mind, they do not obsess his mind; his mind is not at all affected. It remains steady, attained to imperturbability, and he recognizes its vanishing.”  
    —AN 9.26

    \[Note the subtle difference from "no powerful forms, etc. come into range”, which is what people tend to subconsciously expect\].

    And that's also how the Dhamma is "timeless" (*akālika)*: you need time to change the way you feel, whereas right endurance is always presently achievable no matter how you feel.

### Am I practicing the right way?

My practice is to be relaxed and at ease with the right attitude and awareness of what is happening. The attitude I am talking about is the one that allows me to tolerate what is occurring in the present moment without any aversion to it or strong desire. I try to develop this type of awareness constantly. I also develop this awareness by asking questions.

I have noticed that developing this awareness allows me to let go of sensuality more (for example, I have noticed less interest in sexuality). I have also noticed that in situations where I have contact with other people I behave better. For example, quite recently I had a situation when I was talking to a family member who said something that upset me and I noticed this growing aversion. I did not react with aggression to this stimulus, but I behaved in a calm way.

Is it worth continuing this practice if there are results in improving morality and peace?

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1elckwf/am_i_practicing_the_right_way/lgxiwx1/)** _2024-08-07 12:49:28_:

    >My practice is to be relaxed and at ease with the right attitude and awareness of what is happening. The attitude I am talking about is the one that allows me to tolerate what is occurring in the present moment without any aversion to it or strong desire.

    If that attitude automatically makes you keep the precepts and not act on sensual, averse, or distracting intentions, then it could be along the right lines. But if you are able to maintain that type of awareness while also acting in such ways in your day-to-day life, it’s for that very reason not the right type of awareness. The Buddha taught "awareness" and meditation[ with restrained conduct as a non-negotiable prerequisite.](https://suttacentral.net/sn47.3/en/bodhi?lang=en&reference=none&highlight=false)

    Ultimately, however, the goal should be to refine and improve your definition of what the "right attitude" is, and not assume that you already have it. That's how you progress towards the Right View.

### Step by step?

As I currently understand what you are teaching about the gradual training, it is necessary to go step by step in the correct order so as not to unconsciously engage in dukkha management. What I am having trouble understanding is how moderation in eating comes after sense restraint, since isn't immoderate eating (with sensuality at least) tainted with "grasping at the signs and features"? Or is this stage mainly to purify the other unskillful motives for eating (bulking up, beautification)? Also, if lack of accomplishment in virtue basically includes acting on \*any\* unskillful motives through body or speech, wouldn't improper eating already be filtered out through that? Or if not then, through sense restraint? What am I missing?

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1ec6a9u/step_by_step/lezt2vf/)** _2024-07-26 06:10:37_:

    The entire gradual training should be understood as a refinement of the same principle of being able to see unwholesome impulses and not acting out of them.

    In the case of moderation in eating, how to eat with the right attitude would become apparent if you're already skilled in sense restraint, because by then you would have learned that the problem is not the signs and features themselves (in this case the pleasant tastes and experiences related to food) but the "grasping" at those. You can make sense of that in theory, but before sense restraint has been developed, there would be a subconscious tendency to deny the signs and features instead of simply not grasping at them, failing to see where the danger actually lies, and that safety has to be found amidst that which is dangerous (the simile of the deer herd in MN 25).

    Regarding the second question, in theory yes, but in practice no. Someone who's advanced would be able to see the whole sequence of stages as a unity and would no longer think of them individually, but a person who's just starting out with virtue won't be able to see the subsequent aspects with sufficient accuracy to purify them reliably. They can surely try, but it's likely that they'll end up denying things most of the time. Hence the need to go step by step.

    So one should think of "purity" in relative terms, in relation to which stage they're at. For a person who's at the stage of virtue, their body and speech being restrained, to whichever extent they are aware of that, counts as "purity". Once that becomes the norm, they can begin to look for the subtler impurities that are still found within that, which would be lack of sense restraint, and at point they will see clearly for themselves how to address that as opposed to just blindly following an external instruction to do this instead of that.

    You are able to work at any of the "stages" only when you see that the unwholesome intentions on that respective level cannot arise by accident, and that it's always you who lets them in. Whenever you try to work beyond where you're presently at, it will tend to feel like you're fighting against something that imposes itself over you outside your control because you still can't see your own intentions on that deeper level, and so even if you're precisely following the right instruction on paper, it will devolve into a mechanical management method done without real understanding. The widespread misconception that the hindrances are particular thoughts that come to you against your will and require absorption on a meditation object for dispelling is based on an insufficient development of the prerequisites for abandoning the hindrances.

### Questions on Jhāna

Is it not theoretically possible that one could attain jhāna without having gone through the gradual training (e.g. Prince Siddhartha as a young boy, or various devatas)? As such would it be legitimately jhāna but (not being rooted in the complete gradual training and achieved, say, through meditation techniques) simply more dependent on certain conditions (birth in heaven, being on a meditation retreat) and therefore less useful for total release. Or in your view is anyone who attains such a state not truly secluded from unwholesome states and therefore not in jhāna even though they might think they are? In other words, is it possible that using the gradual training as the basis for samādhi is not the only way to reach jhāna but simply the way the Buddha taught it for the sake of permanent freedom? Thank for taking the time.

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1ec693c/questions_on_jhāna/lezrn2r/)** _2024-07-26 05:56:18_:

    It's possible to attain jhāna without being permanently established in renunciation and the gradual training. But the nature of the jhāna itself would be no different, and so it can never be achieved through a meditation technique, which by definition goes in the opposite direction. 

    Somebody can be doing the right things for a while without fully understanding why they're right, i.e. not breaking the precepts, living restrained, seeing sensuality as unsatisfactory, and regarding their experience through a broader context in the right way without denying it or absorbing themselves into some separate object. Because of all this, their minds would be to an extent "separating" from sense objects, and they could have a one-off experience of jhāna. But one experience of jhāna doesn't magically do anything in itself; jhānas are[ just pleasant abidings here and now as the Buddha said](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn8#mn8:4.1-mn8:4.5). 

    *Proficiency* in jhāna or being able to attain it repeatedly is what reveals that a person sees the signs of their mind and comprehends the nature of wholesome and unwholesome to a great degree. Consequently, they would need very little instruction to get the right view, which is nothing other than that same understanding being fully cemented in all its implications. The Bodhisatta had jhāna as a child once, and it's clear that he didn't fully understand how to get it again.

    No absorption practice can ever develop that, and if you look closely, they always depend on a wrong assumption about what the problem is: "These *objects* are the cause of my sensuality, aversion, etc., and therefore I must replace them until they no longer arise". There is a wrong view about what craving and the three poisons are right off the bat, and the culmination of wrong view is wrong samadhi (AN 10.105). So it actively takes you away from the middle way.

### How difficult is it for a sotapanna to reach sakadagami or anagami?

[deleted]

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1e9is7j/how_difficult_is_it_for_a_sotapanna_to_reach/lehpm87/)** _2024-07-23 03:41:49_:

    >sotapanna may be likely to be attainable within a few months

    If it's the real deal, it will take much longer for a monk, let alone a layperson. 

    How long it takes depends on 1) how much "dust" the person has in their eyes (accumulation of defilements and wrong views) and 2) the quality, not just the intensity, of effort they put in to not act out of those defilements, and to leave no stone unturned when questioning their wrong views. For most of us today, both of these metrics aren't very good, and for a layperson, the second one will almost always be less than optimal.

    An "experience" you get after practicing intensively for months is not what makes you a *sotāpanna*. Having sufficiently trained yourself to stop overlooking the sign of your mind/your intentions, having abandoned *all* of your wrong views, and having developed unshakable faith in the Triple Gem and spotless virtue that is not clung to is what does (the four aspects of *sotāpatti* often listed in the Suttas). The fruit of stream entry is the result of *you* having done that work beforehand, for as long as it had to be done depending on your starting point (that you wouldn't be able to gauge except in hindsight), as opposed to "The Experience" being what "transforms" you.

    The same applies for higher attainments.

    >“Mendicants, a farmer has three urgent duties. What three? A farmer swiftly makes sure the field is well ploughed and tilled. Next they swiftly plant seeds in season. When the time is right, they swiftly irrigate or drain the field. These are the three urgent duties of a farmer. That farmer has no special power or ability to say: ‘Let the crops germinate today! Let them flower tomorrow! Let them ripen the day after!’ But there comes a time when that farmer’s crops germinate, flower, and ripen as the seasons change.

    >

    >In the same way, a mendicant has three urgent duties. What three? Undertaking the training in the higher virtue, the higher mind, and the higher wisdom. These are the three urgent duties of a mendicant. That mendicant has no special power or ability to say: ‘Let my mind be freed from defilements by not grasping today! Or tomorrow! Or the day after!’ But there comes a time—as that mendicant trains in the higher virtue, the higher mind, and the higher wisdom—that their mind is freed from defilements by not grasping.

    >

    >So you should train like this: ‘We will have keen enthusiasm for undertaking the training in the higher virtue, the higher mind, and the higher wisdom.’ That’s how you should train.”  
    —AN 3.92

    >  
    Suppose there was a hen with eight or ten or twelve eggs. And she properly sat on them to keep them warm and incubated. Even if that hen doesn’t wish: ‘If only my chicks could break out of the eggshell with their claws and beak and hatch safely!’ Still they can break out and hatch safely. Why is that? Because that chicken with eight or ten or twelve eggs properly sat on them to keep them warm and incubated.  
      
    In the same way, even though a bhikkhu who is committed to development might not wish: ‘If only my mind was liberated from the influxes through non-assumption!’ Even so, his mind is liberated from the influxes through non-assumption. Why is that? You should say: ‘Because of development’. Development in what? Development in the four establishments of recollection, the four right efforts, the four bases of spiritual ability, the five faculties, the five powers, the seven awakening factors, and the noble eightfold path.

    >Suppose a carpenter or his apprentice sees the marks of his fingers and thumb on the handle of his adze. He doesn’t know how much of the handle was worn away today, how much yesterday, and how much previously. He just knows ‘it’s worn away’ once it’s already worn away.

### What does "self" mean?

The average secular or atheistic westerner understands that we're made of components, and that the body regulates itself, they know and agree that we're a bunch of chemicals that can be altered with drugs as many take antidepressants, yet they still believe in a self. So what does self actually mean, both in the real world and suttas?

Does self in the suttas mean having *absolute control*? Because I think most don't think we have absolute control over our bodies/mind, hence people talk about intrusive thoughts, or getting dementia, or some other condition where control is lost.

Does it mean having *partial control*? I think most people believe in this, that if we eat the right foods we can prevent diseases, so we have a partial control over our bodies. But does no-self mean believing we don't have partial control?

Or is it more nuanced? Control over that process which selects and acts on thoughts which are deemed non-intrusive, aka intentions. I.e. intrusive thoughts are not me, but that process that accepts thoughts and turns them into action, is me.

 Maybe it specifically has to do with control over feelings? Perhaps  self means control over mental suffering and feelings? That if one indulges in something pleasant, bad feelings which are "mine" can be eliminated, and good feelings which are "mine" can be arisen. I.e. "I am" feeling bored, therefore if I eat a snack, I will feel pleasant, and no longer bored.  So this is a level of confidence of control over feelings, and eliminating suffering like boredom. 

Then again, self cannot mean control because the dhamma is about removing suffering, so we do have control, or is no-self simply control without a label "self", in which case what does "self" mean then?



Is there anything else that demonstrates a self? What does self really mean?

My clearest most rational definition is that I don't choose to suffer, therefore suffering is no-self. Anything that I choose that doesn't increase suffering can be self/no-self doesn't matter how you define it, but suffering is **always** no-self, as I never wish for it. Therefore to me, suffering is no-self. Hence dukkha *in* anicca, anatta *in* dukkha.

So if someone insists that they have a self, all I have to ask is "do you get bored? Do you suffer?", if they say yes then I ask them "why do you choose to suffer?"

"I am" feeling bored, therefore if I eat a snack, I will feel pleasant, and no longer bored. So this is a level of confidence of control over feelings, and eliminating suffering like boredom.

    Yes, the assumption is most acutely reflected in the attitude towards feelings. Acts of sensuality are the coarsest manifestations of that, but it doesn't end there. Even if you're not specifically doing anything at all, there will still be the tacit assumption that you *could* exert ultimate control over the aggregates if you tried. So that's why sitting down, stopping all activity, and pretending you have no control over your experience doesn't really fix the issue. [You first remove the clearly unwholesome activities](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an3.101), not everything at once.

    The state of affairs is more like the aggregates present you with options, and you can only choose one among those. You can't choose an option that wasn't already available. You can walk because your legs are functional, but you can no longer do so if your legs are amputated. Likewise, you can think and imagine because you have a functional mind that depends on physical factors. So there *is* control, but it's secondary, and secondary control is insufficient to justify a sense of self and ownership.

    >Then again, self cannot mean control because the dhamma is about removing suffering, so we do have control, or is no-self simply control without a label "self", in which case what does "self" mean then?

    Removing suffering doesn't mean removing unpleasant feeling, which would require control. You remove Suffering (Dukkha with capital D) by recognizing the assumption of control as just that—an assumption. And then the aggregates remain as they were, but you no longer Suffer amidst their inherent unpleasantness and unreliability. And that safety is reliable because it doesn't depend on the aggregates doing what you want them to do, as any other safety does, nor does it require you to "slip out" of the aggregates (which is impossible). [Like the deer who learn how not to take the bait even though they still live in the hunting ground.](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn25#mn25:5.25-mn25:6.29)

    >My clearest most rational definition is that I don't choose to suffer, therefore suffering is no-self.

    Yes, but you can't approach it from an impersonal perspective like that. You have to see that if you are suffering, it's because you are unwittingly taking something as self (as in *paṭiccasamuppāda,* if there is sorrow, lamentation, etc., it *has* to be because there is ignorance at the root ). The statement that suffering is not-self only becomes experientially true when you're no longer affected by it, i.e., displeasure is no longer suffering even though it's still there.

### New site for suttas + epubs for Ven. Akincano's and Bhante Anigha's writings

I've been working on a new site to read the read the suttas that I thought I'd share here. It started out just as a place where I could read translations from both Bhikkhu Bodhi and Thanissaro, who were my preferred translators at the time, but since then Bhante Anigha started sharing his excellent translations, so I've them as well. 

I'm also making it a place for resources, so I've compiled all of Venerable Akincano's articles from path press and all of Bhante Anigha's articles from the HH website, and turned them both into ebooks that you can download or read directly on the site with a built in e-reader.

Still a work in progress with a lot more to come, but I figured I'd share it here since others might find the ebooks or suttas useful.

The main site is: [https://abuddhistview.com/](https://abuddhistview.com/)  
and the books can be found at: [https://abuddhistview.com/books](https://abuddhistview.com/books)

Let me know if there's anything specific you'd find helpful. I'll be adding quite a few more books in the near future - audio and ebook

    Nice work. It looks like you're not pulling my translations directly from the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/bkhpanigha/hh-suttas)? I notice some Suttas contain typos and translations of terms that I've edited recently.

### Satipatthana - internal, external, both internal and external.

Friends,

I first read about the Satipatthana Sutta in the seminal work of Ven. Analayo "Satipatthana - The Direct Path to Realization". As for every element of the sutta, Analayo dissects the *interna/external/both* component of the refrain over several pages, and with plenty of references and footnotes. Below is a quick summary:

First, he refers to the Abhidhamma and the commentaries:

>According to the Abhidhamma and the commentarial interpretation, “internal” and “external” satipatthãna encompasses phenomena arising in oneself and in others.

> \[…\]

>in the Satipatthãna Saÿyutta the Buddha introduced these three modes of attention – internal, external, and both – separately as a “threefold way of developing satipatthãna” \[…\] a discourse in the Bojjhaúga Saÿyutta points out that both internal and external sati can act as an awakening factor.

Then into specific Suttas:

>In the Sãmagãma Sutta, for example, the same two terms are used when countering various unwholesome qualities and unskilful forms of behaviour, whether these occur in oneself (ajjhatta) or in others (bahiddhã).

> \[...\] And \[...\]

> in the Janavasabha Sutta, in a context directly related to satipatthãna, “external” explicitly refers to the bodies, feelings, etc. of others. This passage carries considerable weight in relation to the present discussion, since it is the only discourse to provide additional information on the nature of “external” satipatthãna.

After an overview of other, more modern interpretations, he concludes:

>In summary, although alternative ways of understanding internal and external satipatthãna have their practical value, to understand “internal” as referring to oneself and “external” as referring to others offers a practicable form of contemplation which can moreover claim support from the discourses, the Abhidhamma, and the commentaries.

In one of the few posts when this Sutta was discussed in this subreddit (yes, I have read all the posts !!), u/Bhikkhu_Anigha writes the following about the topic ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/176rj53/comment/k4wnyjy/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)):

>\[...\] it's not, as generally interpreted, about contemplating external things like people as opposed to internal ones, which I've seen leads some to think that reflecting on worldly phenomena contributes to enlightenment.

Obviously, I am very keen to find out what Bhikkhu Anigha's interpretation is - unfortunately, he does not elaborate in that post, and I could not find any elsewhere (of course, I might have missed it.)

Also - why the "both internal and external", as expressed multiple times in the refrain? I mean, one can contemplate "internally", or "externally" (whatever their definition), but why add the "both" as a separate method in and all of itself?  As it is often pointed out, the fact that some phrases or words are repeated multiple times in a sutta, it is an indication of the importance the Buddha placed on those instructions, and, as a natural implication, they should be understood.

As always, I am very grateful for any elucidation, May you all be well.

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1e79wsy/satipatthana_internal_external_both_internal_and/le1kiq0/)** _2024-07-20 05:29:54_:

    I hadn't considered the passage in DN18. However, it doesn't actually say that one is mindful externally as a *practice*. It says that one gives rise to knowledge and vision of the body, feelings, etc. of others externally as a result of practice.

    The more useful way of interpreting it is that *ajjhattaṃ* means "implicitly", *bahiddhā* means "explicitly". Or, "peripheral" and "actual".

    So, at certain times, you need to be making effort to explicitly think about the body, feelings, etc.; at other times the recollection is "behind" your direct thinking and attention, by itself. This internal aspect becomes most palpable in *samādhi* (and becoming established in virtue is the most basic form of it), and it's why prior to jhānas the Suttas so often state that the mind [becomes established, settled and composed internally](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=sn35.246#sn35.246:3.13-sn35.246:3.14) (this was the central point of my [most recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/theravada/comments/1e2sv0t/on_thinking_about_jhāna_by_ven_thanissaro/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)). It's also how an Arahant is always mindful effortlessly, despite it being as impossible as before to keep their attention fixed on a particular object forever.

    And sometimes, when the recollection is already implicit in your experience whether you think about it or not, you do make further effort to think about it. You are mindful internally and externally. 

    The *ajjhattaṃ* aspect can be regarded as your internal sense bases (six-sensed body) being in themselves mindful regarding whatever arises for them. Everything manifests already within the context. *Bahiddhā* corresponds to how you'd be paying attention to a specific thought or idea, which is always external. But in the right way, of course: you're thinking of the body within the body (or body concurrently with the body), i.e., the body as a context, and not as an ordinary sense object. 

    Also, meditation methods and techniques in this sense remain perpetually "external" (thus always revolving around observation of specific things), but the relief and usefulness of *sammāsamadhi* or temporary liberation is precisely in how the external aspect [no longer requires maintenance](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn19#mn19:12.1-mn19:12.4), thus giving one a glimpse of the way permanent liberation works.

### A Note on Etymology (and Semantics, I guess)

I like to take a few comments in the other thread as an occasion of saying something about the place of etymology, word-derivation, and semantics in understanding the meaning of (Pāli) words. 

There is a growing trend to misapply etymology in order to justify idiosyncratic readings and understandings of Pāli terms and even to construct far reaching doctrinal arguments based on it, which is hazardous. Bhante Anīgha‘s [foreword](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/) to his *sutta* adaptations may serve as an example: 

>On this site, Bhikkhu Sujato’s copyright-free translations have been adapted to create **a work that rigorously aims to convey the meaning of significant Pāli terms drawing solely on their etymology—which is generally unambiguous—**and eschewing commentarial and later baggage that is often present even in most Pāli dictionaries. \[...\] This approach aims to maintain a clear distinction between translation and interpretation, which is often blurred.

Needless to say, this post is not directed in anyway against Bhante or wants to discredit his adaptations, but simply wants to clarify the proper place of etymology when it comes to interpret Pāli words. 

It is sometimes believed, normally only by beginners and amateurs of Pāli, that the etymology of a Pāli word is the direct path to its true and original meaning. This is a misconception. Originally, granted, that is what [etymology](https://www.etymonline.com/word/etymology) wanted to be, resting on a general human belief that what is older and original must by that also be more true and genuine, and that what comes later tends to be degenerate and false. This is why  arguments referring to etymology appear superficially impressive and convincing to non-experts. 

However, referring to etymology in order to provide the 'true meaning' of a word is a fallacy arising mainly from not knowing what etymology actually is and does today, how it is done properly, and what its necessary limitations are. The misconception also arises from not understanding correctly how meaning in general is constructed within languages. Etymology also more often than not doesn't tell us much about the synchronic meaning and usage of a word. Take the etymology of the word '[understand](https://www.etymonline.com/search?q=understand)' in English, for example. Or, to take a Pāli example, how much does the root of the Pāli word *dhamma* (S. *dharman*)*, dhṛ* 'hold', tell us about the manifold senses, shades, nuances and usages of that term?

Today, etymology is the study of the origin and evolution of a word's semantic meaning across history. It comprises fields such as word formation, diachronic development of form, and diachronic and synchronic meaning, i.e. how word meaning changes over time and what a word means at a specific time or time period. It is thus mainly about how the sense of a word changes over time. Etymology is historical and because of that more often than not speculative and tentative and necessarily ever more limited the further we go back in history, simply due to the limitations of textual sources. It does have a place in learning what a word means, yes, but that place is only advisory and never decisive. 

What determines the meaning of a word at a certain point in time, i.e. its synchronic meaning, is that word's position in a context, its usage, and that context is always interpreted by the translator. That context is hierarchically structured according to phrase, sentence, passage, text, textual corpus and eventually the whole socio-cultural historical environment in which that textual corpus was produced and stood. When it comes to an ancient language, even one as well attested to as Pāli, we run into obvious necessary limitations in reconstructing that context. 

Taking that into account shows the absurdity of [apodictic](https://www.etymonline.com/search?q=apodictic) pronouncements about the meaning of Pāli words solely based on their etymology. The line between translation and interpretation cannot be blurred, because it doesn't exist. Every translation of a text is an interpretation and hence there cannot be "one right translation". 

Bhante writes: 

>Terms and expressions of doctrinal and practical significance found in the early Suttas are sometimes misrepresented in existing translations. 

Yes, indeed. Only the attempt to rely solely on etymology in order to rectify this state of affairs is unsound and far to simplistic. 

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1e71ewd/a_note_on_etymology_and_semantics_i_guess/ldx6y1m/)** _2024-07-19 12:46:18_:

    There certainly is room for different renderings of many Pāli words. I wouldn't take great issue with someone rendering the word *dosa* as either aversion, resistance, or ill will. Translating *saṅkhāra* as fabrication, volitional formation, activity, concoction, etc., or *pīti* as rapture, joy, gladness, bliss, etc., could all be reasonably justified, even though some of them may not fit my personal preference.

    Etymology certainly does not give us one and only one option in most cases, and I often find myself making changes. Moments ago I replaced "spiritual colleague" with "fellow renunciate" for *sabrahmacāri*. I also still haven't found a satisfactory rendering for very elementary terms like *kusala*, and have changed my mind several times.

    What etymology gives us is a rough fence that the translation of a word should not end up outside of. I am not claiming to have found the one and only right spot within the fence, and I don't think there *can* be such a thing simply because English and Pāli are two completely different languages, and I am certainly biasing certain options within the fence based on what I think is best.

    But what I do claim is that things like ["love" for *adosa*](https://suttacentral.net/mn9/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=main&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin#7.1) lie way outside the fence to be acceptable. Translating *teneva pītipāmojjena vihātabbaṃ ahorattānusikkhinā kusalesu dhammesu* as “Then they should *meditate* with rapture and joy, training day and night in skillful qualities” gives a significantly different impression than “Then they should dwell/live/abide...” which all do fall within the range of *viharati*. Just to give some examples.

    I haven't yet found a collection of translations by a single author where such stark deviations do not occur at least sometimes, and that gap is what I hope to fill. I also wouldn't be opposed to changing any of my chosen English renderings if someone were to prove to me that it does not fit either the Pāli word itself well, or its usage in other Suttas I may not have considered.

    I am also well aware that in many cases, a Pāli passage alone does not enforce a particular interpretation, but taking not only etymology but also many different Suttas on the same topic into account certainly shaves off a whole lot of potential misinterpretations that the vast majority of modern teachings heavily rely on. Once those are off the table, it's up to the individual to judge the positive assertions I make about what the right interpretation is, but the space is a lot more narrow than is generally thought if we take as many Suttas into account as possible, and make sure not to casually assume that the Buddha said things he didn't mean, or meant things he didn't ever say.

    >This approach aims to maintain a clear distinction between translation and interpretation, which is often blurred.

    I can acknowledge that this is poorly worded, and sounds as if I'm claiming that I am not interpreting the texts *at all*.

    (Edit: It's also possible that I've been using the term "etymology" wrong, in which case I'm happy to be corrected. What I consider when translating is a word's root, what that root is said to mean in an compendium of roots such as [this](https://discourse.suttacentral.net/t/pali-roots-from-the-saddaniti/2471), what Pāli and Sanskrit dictionaries as well as other translators say, and last but certainly not least, the various occurrences of the word/phrase in different contexts across the Vinaya and Nikāyas, which in rare cases does not immediately follow from its derivation, e.g. *nirodha* .This alone leaves me with a list of possible renderings that are very semantically close almost every time, from which I then pick what I think fits best, though I may change my mind to one of the other options later on.)

### Kusala Citta vs. Sukha Vedana

As Ajahn often instructs, the overaching mood that one is under the influence of, is a close approximation to what the citta is at the time. In what way does one then distinguish a 'gladdened mind' or an 'elated mind' ; from a pleasant feeling.

Since both *Citta* as well as *Vedana* are peripheral, and structurally precede dhammas, is it possible to tell them apart, and/or is it even necessary; since the *working principle* of the practice is to restrain from acting on the basis of *either one* (regardless of being able to tell them apart).

Thank you.

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1e6434y/kusala_citta_vs_sukha_vedana/ldw3bfi/)** _2024-07-19 06:19:08_:

    The most important difference would be that you can have a pleasant feeling accompanied by an unwholesome *citta*, since there can be a context or mood of valuing sensuality accompanying that feeling. Similarly, there can be unpleasant feeling with a wholesome *citta* that values renunciation (the pain of renunciation, as it's called in some Suttas).

    So, basically, *citta* would be along the lines of what you are valuing and inclining towards, aside from the way you currently happen to feel.

### Asking for help

Hello everyone,

I'm in my mid 20s with a stable job and low income. I'm considering advancing my career. The existential pressure I am currently feeling is hard to handle as I also maintain a consideration that I could just up and leave to go to a monastery. My attachments are preventing me from doing so currently. I take the 5 precepts and want to be celibate, but struggle to commit to the decision. I feel overwhelmed due to my mind going back and forth on and on in trying to make a decision about developing my career by undertaking further studying (as I'm unable to commit to renunciation fully) or just to make further effort to go to a monastery.

Leaving to go to a monastery could just be a cop out for putting effort to ensure I can look after myself in the world and fend for myself (I currently live with my mum and step dad.)

I have this constant background noise regarding decision this every day and have had it for a while. Does anyone have any advice?

    >Leaving to go to a monastery could just be a cop out for putting effort to ensure I can look after myself in the world and fend for myself (I currently live with my mum and step dad.)

    It could, but that doesn't mean staying at home and continuing to pursue a career is better automatically. You could improve the context that you're approaching monastery life with, and realize that it's actually going to be harder than anything you might try in lay life, but infinitely more fruitful if you use it wisely. Then it will no longer present itself as a cop out, and if you truly value freedom from suffering, you would see it as the ideal choice.

    And then even if you stay at home, you would be tailoring your life to fit those values as much as possible, instead of thinking you're justified in maintaining conditions that are not conducive to taming the mind because you won't ordain after all.

### On Withstanding the Defilements

Hello everyone,

I've been engaging with the teachings of Ajahn Nyanamoli and HH on and off for the past years, finding them sometimes more, sometimes less convincing and useful.

The recent upload on YouTube, "Withstanding the Defilements" got me interested in writing this post.

I take a summary of the talk that was approved by the channel in the comments as a starting point:

>"Phenomena arise on their own. You can not stop that. If annoyance arises within me, the unpleasant feeling of annoyance itself is not the problem. The problem is if I start dwelling on that arisen feeling. If I start getting worked up about it. The problem is if I lash out at someone next to me due to my aversion to that arisen annoyance." - ToKiniAndy

Phenomena here includes the defilements, "some form of greed, hatred and delusion", as mentioned in the quote of a question to Ajahn Chah at the beginning. So, the way to properly deal with arisen defilements of greed, hatred and delusion (or however one wants to render *rāga*, *dosa*, *moha*) is to fortify the mind through virtue and sense restraint and not act out of or based on those arisen defilements in any way, simply letting them endure as the arisen phenomena they always already were. This is safety, this is the "island that no flood can overwhelm". If you don't go towards the waves, you don't wet yourself.

However, it seems that the teaching of "enduring arisen defilements" is contradicted by several passages in the suttas. Take, e.g., the following section of MN 2 on "detriments to be gotten rid of through dispelling" (*āsavā vinodanā pahātabbā*):

>... Here, monks, reflecting properly, a monk **does not endure (*****nādhivāseti*****)** an arisen thought of sensuality, **he gets rid of it, dispells it, makes an end to it (*****byantīkaroti*****), eradicates it (*****anabhāvaṃ gameti*****, lit. causes it do go to non-existence).** A monk **does not endure (*****nādhivāseti*****)** an arisen thought of ill-will ... an arisen thought of cruelty ... variously arisen bad, unwholesome things, **he gets rid of them, dispells them, makes an end to them (*****byantīkaroti*****), eradicates them (*****anabhāvaṃ gameti*****, lit. causes it do go to non-existence).**

"Detriments to be gotten rid of through enduring", *āsavā adhivāsanā pahātabbā*, are mentioned earlier on. Defilements are not listed here, but various painful bodily experiences.

Consider also the following (SN 38.3):

>Those for whom, friend, greed ... hatred ... delusion ... is gotten rid of, with it's root cut, made like the site of a (previous) palm tree, **made non-existent (*****anabhāvaṅ*****-*****kato*****), not liable to arise (again) in the future (*****āyatiṃ anuppādadhammo),*** they are blessed (*sugatā*) in the world.

This is about the arahant. If the Buddha had meant that defilements are to be endured or withstood infinitely without acting out of them, he could have simply said so. Terms like *adhivāsanā*, *adhivāseti*, *khanti*, *khamo*, *khamati* are definetly used in the texts in senses of '(patiently) enduring, (fore-)bearing etc.', but they seem not to be employed positively when it comes to defilements. After all, *dukkhanirodha*, the third noble truth, is called the "**remainderless fading away and cessation** of craving" (*taṇhāya asesa-virāga-nirodho,* cp. SN 56.11), not simply the non-acting out of it.

What are your thoughts on this? If I should have misrepresented Ajahn Nyanamoli's teachings here, I would be glad to be corrected.

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1e5i0zr/on_withstanding_the_defilements/ldq668j/)** _2024-07-18 04:51:21_:

    The confusion stems from conflating unwholesome thoughts (*vitakka*) and the perceptions and feelings that accompany them. Saying that you should "endure" the former would be like saying you should endure breaking the precepts, which is silly. But trying to "obliterate" the latter is also silly, because they're not in your control to begin with, and by trying to get rid of them you'll be acting out of craving there and then. It's like smashing all bottles of alcohol you encounter so as to not break the fifth precept.

    Instead, you "starve" the craving by enduring the perceptions and feelings, and enduring them means you won't be doing unwholesome actions by body. speech, or thought.

    >"**remainderless fading away and cessation** of craving

    And that's what leads to this, whereas if you're only concerned with suppressing and avoiding the entire picture and not just the part you're responsible for (the intentional thoughts), you're not addressing craving at its root, but merely concealing the triggers for it.

    And the Suttas do speak about "enduring" in this way. See SN 35.228, SN 35.247, MN 4, Thag 1.21, Thag 2.36, and the first line of the Ovāda Pātimokkha for a few examples.

### My circumstances, and ordination. Gratefully asking for advice.

I am a psychology graduate living in the UK. Have gone through abuse most of my life and only gotten my freedom 2.5 years ago. Originally wanted to go into a career of mental health. Had an on-off secular meditation practice of 7 years. Used to be nostril-watcher but changed as I had to cultivate better behaviours to overcome trauma.

I stumbled upon HH a year ago by accident. I was starting to get into buddhism due to an ego death experience on mushrooms and curiosity into the concept of nibbana and the spiritual life. I was planning to join the army as an unconventional route into the mental health field (developing leadership skills, tolerating high amounts of stress, cultivating and teaching emotional intelligence to soldiers etc.).

As I started watching HH videos, I started to gain knowledge in buddhism and was considering becoming a monk after 5 years into the army. Then I watched more videos and recognised that pursuing the spiritual path is the most important thing I can do in my life. My background, purpose, everything, this is exactly what I want and need to do.

I contacted my therapist who helped me overcome lots of my trauma and told her about my decision. What then started was a strange but unique arrangement, I started talking to her again, paying for her time to start watching HH videos so I could practise my learning by teaching her the concepts and finding holes in my knowledge whereby she would ask questions I couldn't answer. Over time she started to understand buddhism more and its implications, understands my urge to ordain and the sheer weighted difference between the dhamma and psychotherapy. I have tried to talk about the dhamma to friends but even the slightest claim that circumstances might not be the cause of suffering has severely upset them, so I have nobody else to talk to who is not psychologically minded besides my trusted therapist, who, thankfully is starting to understand the 'context' of suffering vs the content. She is providing me with that middle ground - not an uninstructed person with no knowledge of the mind where I have to start from scratch, but western-orientated enough to push me to properly understand the concepts enough to teach. I have yet to find any other mental health professional who grasps not-self mundanely. She comments that despite being a beginner in learning she gets that the stuff we discuss are things most people could not comprehend, whether monk or layperson, and would be terrified to explore.

My learning arrangement might be strange but it works for now as I try to organise myself.

I plan to ordain, roughly in the first few months of next year. I've read previous posts but I'm still lost...

The advantages of my situation is that upon telling my family they were incredibly supportive. I am indeed half thai so my mother is already obsessed with turning my ordination into an extravaganza purely for thai culture. I have lots of money in savings so can afford to quit my job at the start of next year for more seclusion in my laylife, and need not worry about emergency funds.

Problem is, with my mother being so toxic and me being a survivor of filial piety, I feel like her support is going to be simultaneously a major help and obstruction. She already wants to sort out my visa, but I'm worried she will try to push me to go to a crap monastery.

I understand that picking out monasteries in general is picking the least worse out of the bunch, and my post is asking about whether my heritage will help me or whether I should consider Sri Lanka. I'm wondering whether I should quit my job early so I can have enough free time to obtain the right view. I'm wondering whether if I go to a thai monastery where they confiscate my phone, would I be allowed to bring physical books and even printed papers of HH video transcripts (if I'm that desperate)? Do the bad monasteries allow you to study any material or do you literally just chant and polish floors?

My brother thinks I should ordain in a UK monastery as he knows how awful thai ones can be. Was wondering if anyone has experience with english monasteries or heard of what they are like?

Some people have recommended a partially renounced lay lifestyle before considering ordination but I'm not sure why that it is and would appreciate everyone's perspective on this.

Thank you for reading, sorry for the long post, I appreciate any comments or pointers in the right direction.

    >My brother thinks I should ordain in a UK monastery as he knows how awful thai ones can be.

    That may not work. Apparently, you can get in trouble at English Ajahn Chah monasteries to the point of being denied ordination simply due to expressing interest in HH, even if you're polite and well-behaved.

    The sheer amount of monasteries in Thailand means that at least a few should be good enough, even if most of them are inadequate for various reasons. All you really need is a place where the Vinaya is kept, you have some free time in seclusion and are not overburdened with duties and activities, and you won't get punished just for having a different view than the seniors as long as you're otherwise a good monk. It's not a dealbreaker if you lose internet access for as long as you don't get in trouble for using the "wrong" Dhamma resources.

### Path Press recommended reading

I'm interested in reading the writings of Ajahn Nyanamoli Thero, but I've heard 'Meanings,' in particular, can be quite challenging. Is this true? If so, are there any other books on the Path Press Publications website that can help me understand 'Meanings' or any of his other books better?

I already have some context from the YouTube videos, I just wanted something in book format.

Thanks in advance for any recommendations! I really appreciate the help.

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1e4odxk/path_press_recommended_reading/ldgpnt3/)** _2024-07-16 15:36:43_:

    You'll be much closer to understanding Meanings the way it's supposed to be understood—as descriptions of the way out of suffering that are directly applicable to your own experience—if you've been earnestly putting into practice what is said in Dhamma Within Reach, The Only Way to Jhāna, the Dhamma talks, and of course the Suttas. Limited intelligence is not the real obstacle. 

    The more rigorous style of Clearing the Path by Ven. Ñāṇavīra can help point out how various fashionable doctrines and notions are actually not canonical, so it can be useful for those with prior experience with Buddhist teachings and somewhat of an intellectual bent. For those who are totally new, it's probably not strictly essential.

### Some assistance with understanding the “extent” of defilements?

It is my understanding that defilements are maintained by ignorance, so understanding them – their “extent” or entire domain – results in their abandonment right there and then. We cannot understand something and be ignorant of it at the same time. The mind infected with greed is actively maintaining its infection through ignorance of that activity. Seeing the sign of the mind infected with greed means recognizing that greediness is a detrimental overlay, something inflicted on experience by the assumed ownership of the untamed citta’s inclination toward a sense object. The Right View includes the recognition of how defilements cannot defile the mind without the false belief that they can. Until the full extent of defilements is recognized, any recognition of a defilement will disguise the defilement that underlies that recognition as its background and context. For example, even our attempt to peripherally apprehend the mind of greed may be done with aversion because we cannot discern what is simultaneously present. 

Am I misunderstanding anything? Because it isn’t clear to me why a sotapanna cannot be defiled by the defilements. Does that mean that the way they relate to their underlying tendencies is fundamentally different from how a worldling regards the defilements? Or is there such a thing as lapses in the Right View based on those tendencies? 

Thanks in advance to anyone who takes the time to reply.

    >Until the full extent of defilements is recognized, any recognition of a defilement will disguise the defilement that underlies that recognition as its background and context. For example, even our attempt to peripherally apprehend the mind of greed may be done with aversion because we cannot discern what is simultaneously present.

    It’s true that initially one cannot see the full extent of defilements, but it’s not like you then get to see it by trying extra hard to do so. You simply train according to what you can presently recognize; the Gradual Training is the refinement of restraining defilements, and that's why it follows a certain order. Diligence in not yielding to the unwholesome tendencies that are now discernible (which initially would be the obvious breaking of the precepts) *on its own* broadens the mind so that less blatant aspects are gradually uncovered. You can’t manually "dig up" the defilements, but what you can do is renounce the acts that covered them up.

    >Does that mean that the way they relate to their underlying tendencies is fundamentally different from how a worldling regards the defilements?

    Yes. It means that they *will* become aware of the underlying tendencies if they try. They will not overlook them if they don’t want to. On the other hand, a *puthujjana* has a high likelihood of unwittingly covering up their own greed, aversion, and delusion through secondary alibis such as their views, tradition, textual authority, devotion to a method or a teacher, sense of duty, etc. (even if they’re theoretically well-founded) because they lack self-honesty and don’t sufficiently see their own mind, nor the fact that that’s where all wholesome or unwholesome takes place and the rest is secondary. A *puthujjana* will tend to put their views and preferred observances/practices first and the need to see the present defilements second, tacitly assuming that these will somehow take care of their defilements by themselves (a salient characteristic of meditation techniques). In contrast, for a *sotāpanna* the priority has been flipped: the Right View is precisely *about* prioritizing the craving that is concretely seen at any given time, and no external crutches, psychologizing, or uncertainty of any kind are involved, which is why their practice would remain even after their memory is completely wiped in a new life.

    >Or is there such a thing as lapses in the Right View based on those tendencies?

    The diligence informed by the Right View can lapse, but not the Right View itself. And again, there is a difference in that if and when the sotāpanna is diligent, even if it’s only once in a blue moon, they are unquestionably moving in the right direction, whereas a puthujjana can be diligent 24/7 in a way that creates more harm than good because of their wrong view. Hence, “sotāpanna”[ literally means](https://suttacentral.net/sn55.5/en/sujato?lang=en) one who has entered the stream (the Noble Eightfold Path) that now "carries" them to Nibbāna.

### On “Thinking about Jhāna” by Ven. Thanissaro

I discovered [this recent writing](https://www.dhammatalks.org/books/HeartFlowing/06-thinking-about-jhana.html) by Ven. Ṭhānissaro that attempts to disprove some of the points I made in my essay about the jhānas (not sure if deliberately), and so I decided to address the main remarks made there because it serves as an opportunity to better articulate and expand upon the essence of what I originally wrote. It’s not necessary to be familiar with the original essay to comprehend the following.

>The longstanding habit of translating jhāna as “absorption” has been called into question, largely because the verb jhāyati is often translated in a more generic way as “meditate.” From this, it’s been argued that, because the verb has a generic meaning, the noun should, too.

>But even if we ignore the argument’s weak logic, we can note that its starting point—the persistent habit of translating jhāyati as “meditate”—is itself questionable. There’s nothing in the suttas to indicate that jhāyati, used in a positive sense in the context of meditation, means anything other than specifically, “do jhāna.”

A number of instances indicate that it does have a generic meaning. In the account of [MN 36](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn36#mn36:21.2) of the bodhisatta's period of austerities, it's said that he thought to himself at one point: *“yannūnāhaṃ appāṇakaṃ jhānaṃ jhāyeyyaṃ”*. This expression uses both the noun *jhāna* and the verb *jhāyati* in a context that most certainly does not refer to the standard four jhānas, since at that time he had not yet acknowledged those states as the way to enlightenment. “Appāṇaka jhāna” cannot refer to the fourth jhāna, also evidenced by how he had clearly not reached the genuine cessation of breathing, but was rather holding his breath as a form of austerity. Similarly, in DN 19, the brahmin Mahāgovinda thinks: *“yannūnāhaṃ karuṇaṃ jhānaṃ jhāyeyyaṃ”*, and we know from the Suttas that even though the four brahmavihāras are a form of *samādhi* that can fulfill the same purpose as the four jhānas, they’re not the same.

In AN 11.9, *jhāyati* is used in a generic sense throughout, and there it certainly does not refer to the jhānas only, since the formless dimensions are mentioned (which are not jhānas; they’re misclassified as such by the Commentaries, not the Suttas). Similarly, MN 108 states that the Buddha “did not praise all *jhāna*”, which there is no reason to interpret as meaning that he does not approve of some “types” of the four jhānas (a concept that, as we shall see, is unfounded). It means he does not approve of all types of meditation, for the lack of a better word.

>Second, even though the suttas do devote a lot of space to the practice of using thought to abandon unskillful qualities and to develop skillful qualities, that doesn’t mean that such a practice should be called jhāna. The actual fact of the matter, as we will see, is that the suttas describe this practice as a step prior to jhāna (DN 2; AN 10:99), and not as jhāna itself.

There is some truth to this. We see in MN 19 that the Buddha had to go a step further than mere wholesome thinking in order to enter the first jhāna, and we see the exact same situation implied in [AN 3.121](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an3.121). There is a point where only wholesome thoughts are left, but the mind is not yet fully appeased. However, “composing the mind internally” does not mean becoming absorbed or immersed, but the complete opposite. Demonstrating this is the main purpose of this writing.

>Fourth, and most graphically, the fact that doing jhāna would involve, not thinking, but actual absorption in physical and mental sensations, is shown in the similes we’ve quoted above: The meditator is said to pervade the body with feelings of pleasure to the point where, in the third jhāna, nothing in the body is unpervaded, and then moving on to a state in which the body is filled with a pure bright awareness. It’s hard to interpret this simply as a process of thinking, and not to see it as a state of full-body absorption in bodily and mental sensations.

Pervading the body with the pleasure of jhāna is indeed not a matter of ordinary thinking, but it’s a stretch to assume that it therefore must be the result of immersion in physical sensations. It’s neither.

Firstly, any sensation at all (which should not be confused with feeling or *vedanā*), no matter how internal it is, has to fall within the external sense field of tactile phenomena (i.e., the fifth string of sensuality). This is evidenced by how the Buddha chose to describe the 6 internal sense bases as “void, empty, and hollow”, comparing them to an empty village that gets attacked by bandits (the six external sense bases). If the 5th internal sense base could be outlined by certain sensations, it would have a specific substance defining it, and thus it wouldn’t be “void”.

The designation “whole body” in the jhāna similes of the bathman, etc., should not be interpreted as primarily spatial, in which case the instruction to pervade the whole body will be misunderstood as some sort of body scan exercise, as it often is. The body is a phenomenological totality that can only be approached as a unity, so even if one suffuses every single pore and internal point where sensations of touch are felt with pleasant energies, that’s still not the whole body. The sum of its parts does not equal the whole. That totality is also what one becomes increasingly separated from in the jhāna progression, which is why one gets to relate to it more and more equanimously, culminating in the fourth jhāna where the mind has separated itself from the most foundational aspect of the body, which is breathing. The totality of the body is not in itself spatial; [it is that because of which the world, including space, is there to begin with](https://suttacentral.net/sn2.26/en/sujato).

Now, in the case of the first jhāna which is the most pivotal, we need only look at the [standard description](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=dn2#dn2:69.1-dn2:74.4) of the practice that precedes it to see what *pītisukha* is supposed to result from: the relief of no longer being liable to the mental burden of the five hindrances. The mind disentangles and becomes separated from the pull of unwholesome states once they’ve been sufficiently seen as troublesome and unwanted, and it’s even said that the joy arises when one *considers* their absence—a mental, reflective affair—and not that the pleasure arises at the bodily level first. And, as the same description says further on, which occurs over fifty times in the Nikāyas, it’s when the mind is already joyous that the body calms down. Not the other way around.

One who has not clearly seen with right understanding the unsatisfactoriness and peril of sensuality is said to be incapable of entering the first jhāna (AN 6.73), as this is the tool for giving rise to *pītisukha*. If the origin of *pītisukha* were bodily, we would expect the Buddha to say that one can’t attain the first jhāna if one doesn’t know how to work with bodily sensations, and there is nothing in the texts to indicate this. Pervading the body with rapture and pleasure comes *after* the attainment of jhāna, not before.

We should also note that being “not of the flesh” (*nirāmisa*) is one of the five characteristics of *sammāsamādhi* (AN 5.27). There certainly is physical rapture in the jhānas, but, again, it is a *symptom* of the mind having successfully transcended the hindrances. Bodily pleasure is a palpable proxy for a mind properly detached from unwholesome states; it’s not beneficial in and of itself, and it’s unjustified to assume that because certain pleasant physical sensations in a meditative state don’t arise based on outside objects or people, they automatically cannot fall within the five cords of sensual pleasure, and that delight in them is thus not unskillful. Unskillfulness depends solely on one’s attitude, and not on the characteristics of a given experience.

The pleasure of jhāna arises and intensifies *because* one is cultivating a dispassionate and disinterested attitude in regard to the entire domain of the body. The suffering and burden of craving that was there before has been lifted ([hence the Buddha’s comparison with relief from debt, illness, etc.](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=dn2#dn2:69.1-dn2:74.2)), and this relief has an acute and substantial physical counterpart. If gaining more pleasure becomes the main goal, the dispassion that was the source the relief is no longer the priority, and you’ve fallen back to the five hindrances, or never surmounted them.

The simile of the bathman kneading the bath powder to the perfect moisture points to the fact that if you begin to internally *relish* the pleasure of the first jhāna, it’s too wet. If the pleasure is not there, it’s too dry, and it shows that mentally you’re not sustaining the perspective that keeps the mind detached from the hindrances. The middle point is where the mind is indifferent to the pleasure, and yet it’s doing everything right for it to manifest, i.e., regarding desire for any bodily experience as the taking on a burdensome debt.

Consider also how in AN 6.63, sensuality is defined as passionate intention (*saṅkapparāga*) for the likeable and agreeable objects of the five senses: the pleasant bodily sensations (“touches cognizable by the body”) that do factually arise in jhāna are not magically exempted from this, and if the mind is thirsting after those, it’s not withdrawn from sensuality. Conversely, to reiterate, it also means that the presence of agreeable bodily sensations in jhāna does not *intrinsically* make it sensual, because if it is true jhāna, the mind will not be passionately inclining towards them.

This is why it wasn’t immediately obvious to the Buddha that the pleasure of jhāna should not be feared. He would’ve been apprehensive of the physical pleasure in and of itself, overlooking the fact that the attitude of the mind towards it is different from that of any other pleasure (i.e., thirsting for more). Those who enter the first jhāna are already said to be “hungerless, extinguished, crossed over, and gone beyond in that respect” (*nicchāta nibbutā tiṇṇā pāraṅgatā tadaṅgena*, AN 9.33. See also AN 9.47 and other repetitions in that chapter that compare all of the jhānas to Nibbāna). The notion that there can be hungering after the pleasure of the first jhāna—where all such unskillful resolves have already ceased *without remainder* as per MN 78—and that it can even become tiresome eventually, blatantly contradicts the Suttas.

>What’s more, the suttas frequently describe the fourth jhāna as the basis for developing such psychic powers as the ability to read minds and to recollect past lifetimes. This would be impossible if the fourth jhāna were simply a thinking process of abandoning unskillful qualities and developing skillful ones. But it would be entirely possible that these psychic powers could develop from a still, full-body awareness.

It’s much less reasonable to expect absorption to result in psychic powers. Zooming *out* of experience, which is what *sammāsamādhi* is about, rather than zooming further and further *into* it, is what allows the mind to wield power over what it’s now fully detached from, and to no longer be limited by concerns of the present to the point where it can remember previous lives. It also guarantees that those aren't hallucinations, which easily result from absorption.

>So given that the one-pointed oblivious definition of jhāna requires that the Buddha was either devious or incompetent in his teachings—using “body” to mean not-body, and “thinking” to mean not-thinking—we have to reject that definition of what jhāna entails.

This is correct. But the distinction between absorption in one fine point and in whole-body pleasure is not at all fundamental. There is no reason to assume the latter is any more conducive to the right kind of knowledge and vision than the former, and, as we’ve already seen, the latter can easily fall within the scope of sensuality, while the former drifts more into the domain of delusion.

>In other words, we have to assume that vitakka and vicāra have the same meaning both in the first jhāna and in the stage prior to it. This means that the difference between the first jhāna and the stage prior to it is not a matter of thinking and not thinking. As we’ll see, it’s more a matter of what you’re thinking about and why.

>In the second stage, the first jhāna, you engage in enough vitakka and vicāra focused on the theme of your concentration to maximize the pleasure and rapture you can gain from staying with that theme and to spread that pleasure and rapture throughout the body.

The implication here seems to be that even though *vitakka* and *vicāra* are the same, in jhāna they are limited to a specific topic, and this is not the case. It is said in AN 4.77 that the “range of one in jhāna” (*jhāyissa jhānavisayo*) is one of the four inconceivables. This refers to the fact that even in the first jhāna there are no constraints as to the specifics of where the mind moves (in this case through *vitakkavicāra*). The mind has achieved the first stage of *limitlessness*. There is no fixed answer to the question “What is someone in the first jhāna thinking about?”, and yet the mind is undoubtedly unified and undistracted [*within* what used to distract it](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an9.42#an9.42:3.1-an9.42:4.2).

We even see [from the Buddha’s own account](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an3.63) that changing postures during jhāna practice poses no difficulty. [AN 4.12](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an4.12) explains why this is the case, showing also that the body can be calm and undisturbed even during movement. As already explained, this is because this physical calm is a byproduct of the right mental attitude that’s been cultivated long enough. It’s stated as well that one who cannot bear all of the five senses, not just the tactile faculty, would not be able to enter upon right samādhi (AN 5.113). If we look carefully, we find that most approaches to meditation revolve around cocooning the mind away from the five senses well beyond what the Suttas say is necessary, which is physical seclusion with virtue established beforehand. It’s only the degree of the cocooning, what’s happening within it, and the narrative behind it that can vary. Whether you enclose the mind in a tiny vial or in a larger gallon-sized jug, you are still *limiting* it, and this is the opposite of what the Buddha encourages:

>“Sandha, meditate like a thoroughbred, not like a wild colt.

>And how does a wild colt meditate? A wild colt, tied up by the feeding trough, meditates: ‘Fodder, fodder!’ Why is that? Because it doesn’t occur to the wild colt tied up by the feeding trough: ‘What task will the horse trainer have me do today? How should I respond?’ Tied up by the feeding trough it meditates: ‘Fodder, fodder!’

>In the same way, take a certain untrained person who has gone to the forest, the root of a tree, or an empty hut... They meditate relying on earth, water, fire, and air. They meditate relying on the extent of infinite space, infinite consciousness, nothingness, or neither-perception-nor-non-perception. *They meditate relying on this world or the other world. They meditate relying on what is seen, heard, thought, cognized, attained, sought, or explored by the mental faculty.* That’s how an untrained person meditates.

>And how does a thoroughbred meditate? *A fine thoroughbred, tied up by the feeding trough, doesn’t meditate: ‘Fodder, fodder!’* Why is that? Because it occurs to the fine thoroughbred tied up by the feeding trough: ‘What task will the horse trainer have me do today? How should I respond?’ >Tied up by the feeding trough they don’t meditate: ‘Fodder, fodder!’ For that fine thoroughbred regards the use of the goad as a debt, a bond, a loss, a misfortune.

>In the same way, take a certain fine thoroughbred person who has gone to the forest, the root of a tree, or an empty hut …They don’t meditate relying on earth, water, fire, and air. They don’t meditate relying on the extent of infinite space, infinite consciousness, nothingness, or neither-perception-nor-non-perception. They don’t meditate relying on this world or the other world. They don’t meditate relying on what is seen, heard, thought, cognized, attained, sought, or explored by the mental faculty. Yet they do meditate.

>When a fine thoroughbred meditates like this, the gods together with Indra, Brahmā, and the Progenitor worship them from afar:

>‘Homage to you, O thoroughbred! Homage to you, supreme among men! We don’t understand what your meditation relies on.’” —AN 11.9

>Bhikkhus, being judicious and recollected, develop limitless *samādhi*. —AN 5.27

>When he sees a sight with the eye, if it’s agreeable he doesn’t harbor passion for it, if it’s disagreeable he’s not averse to it. He lives with recollection of the body established and with a limitless mind. And he understands as it is the liberation by mind and liberation by understanding where those bad, detrimental qualities cease without remainder. —MN 38

To shed more light on this matter, let’s take a closer look at [MN 19](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn19). There’s one subtle and often overlooked qualification that occurs there regarding the type of thinking the Buddha used to discern the danger in unwholesome states, and which he concluded would bar his mind from fully calming down:

>“Still, thinking and pondering along with it (*anuvitakkayato anuvicārayato*) for too long would tire my body. And when the body is tired, the mind is bothered. And when the mind is bothered, it’s far from composure. So I established, settled, unified, and composed my mind internally. Why is that? So that my mind would not be bothered.”

The *anu-* prefix, added to both *vitakka* and *vicāra*, means “along with”. What this indicates is that even though those thoughts were skillful, they were still a form of the mind going “with the grain”—the five hindrances were still subtly in control. That striving was not something he could’ve skipped, however, but now that it has served its purpose, he goes on to “compose his mind internally”. It’s easy to assume that this means he simply shrunk the scope of *vitakkavicāra* and went on to limit it to something more specific such as the breath or thoughts of a particular subject. But this is not what the Sutta itself goes on to describe:

>“Suppose it’s the last month of summer, when all the crops have been gathered within a village, and a cowherd must take care of the cattle. While at the root of a tree or in the open, he need only remember that the cattle are there. *In the same way, I needed only to remember that those phenomena were there.* My effort was roused up and steadfast, my recollection was established and lucid, my body was calm and unperturbed, and my mind was composed and collected. Quite disjoined from sensuality, disjoined from detrimental phenomena, with thinking and with pondering, with joy and comfort born of separation, I abided having entered upon the first jhāna.”

Note the comparison with the cattle being left to roam around and the cowherd no longer needing to constantly control them like before. The Buddha chose his similes carefully. This alludes to how, once coarse unskillful states have been reined in through active effort of contemplation, *vitakkavicāra* can now be left to roam freely as long as one is able to maintain recollection (*sati*) over those phenomena. This is how *vitakkavicāra* in the first jhāna is not constricted within any singular subject even though the mind is definitely unified. When mindfulness becomes imperturbable, the content of thoughts no longer matters, since it was not their content that induced the hindrances, but rather the lack of separation (*viveka*) from that content, and that separation is precisely what mindfulness creates—a vantage point, as it were. This is spelled out more explicitly in Madhyama Āgama 102, the Chinese parallel to MN 19, where the following description comes in place of the first jhāna:

>Let me rather keep my mind in check within, continuously dwelling in inner tranquility, unified, having attained concentration, so that my mind will not be troubled. Thereafter I kept my mind in check within, continuously dwelling in inner tranquility, unified, having attained concentration, and my mind was no longer troubled. \[If\] a thought without sensual desire (ill will ... cruelty ...) arose in me, I further \[allowed\] thoughts to arise that were inclined toward the Dharma and in accordance with the Dharma. Why was that? \[Because\] I did not see that countless evil and unwholesome states would arise because of \[such thoughts\]. It is as in the last month of autumn, when the entire harvest has been collected, a cowherd boy sets the cows free in the uncultivated fields and is mindful of them, thinking, “My cows are there in the herd.” Why is that? Because the cowherd boy does not see that he would be scolded, beaten, or imprisoned for any trespassing. For this reason he is mindful of them thus, “My cows are there in the herd.”

The general nature of all thinking—the recognition that a thought is always a *dhamma* regardless of its content—is the place of unification of mind (*cittekaggatā*). To bring up AN 5.27 again, this is the other essential quality of proper *samādhi* that is not fulfilled by absorption: nothing needs to be held back, excluded, or controlled, and instead everything has been unified within the same overarching theme.

Furthermore, absorption of any kind by definition cannot qualify as “composing the mind internally”, since anything that one can absorb oneself in will be a sight, sound, smell, taste, tactile object, or mental image, and these are all *external* (the six external sense fields). And if we carefully consider what *sati* is even in ordinary situations, we will see that in a sense it is already not bound to any specific sense object, and *samādhi* is of course nothing but a solid and imperturbable mindfulness:

Imagine you’re driving and are about to enter a highway that has speed limit, and you want to be mindful not to exceed it. How do you go about this? Where is the quality of minfulness there? Is it in intently paying attention to every muscle in your leg lengthening and contracting as you operate the pedals, implying that if you stop doing that, you will exceed the speed limit? Or is it a broader awareness at the back of your mind that would remain even when you’re focused on something else, such as talking with the passenger or listening to the radio? Sure enough, you may from time to time focus your attention on the speed meter and adjust your pressure on the gas pedal or hit the brakes, but all of this would be a *result* of being mindful not to exceed the speed limit. And you can’t pin this mindfulness down to some specific sense object because, even when your focus is taken by something else, it’s still there. And it will remain there, at the back of your mind without needing to actively refresh it, for as long as you don’t get overly captivated by any particular thing, mental or physical, within the field of experience. If we also consider the nature of what a memory (another translation for *sati*) is, we’ll see that it’s something that *contexualizes* something else that we directly perceive with our senses.

Similarly, when the Buddha says that upon composing his mind internally he needed only to be mindful that those phenomena were there, it means that he simply needed to *not* allow his attention to become narrowed by anything in particular, like the cowherd doesn’t need to chase after any individual cow anymore and can instead leisurely sit at the root of a tree, keeping sight of the whole herd from afar without forgetting about it altogether. Not by coincidence, this is also the [principle of sense restraint](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn38#mn38:35.1-mn38:35.9), which is said to give rise to joy (SN 35.94, SN 35.97).

The reason why even though he had purified his mind from coarse unskillful thoughts it was still not at peace is that disturbance is due to “taking up” (*upadhi*), and particular unwholesome thoughts are only a secondary byproduct of this. So, even if you stop all deliberate defiled acts of body, speech, and thought and volitionally think only skillful thoughts, the taking up of some aspects of your experience will still be there, and this can only be remedied by a sufficient degree of mindfulness (in the proper sense explained here: a background recognition that expands the mind beyond particularities). Thus it is said that the first jhāna is born [out of being detached (*viveka*) from *upadhi* or taking up](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn64#mn64:9.2).

As seen from AN 9.34, the pleasure of each jhāna is determined by the extent of affliction that it respectively transcends. The relief is determined by the old burden, which previously used to be “everything”. From the previous point of view, it can be said that nothing is felt because the mind now abides disconnected, looking down from above at what *used* to be everything, and *that* is pleasant. It’s not a new pleasure generated from scratch that steals the show from what was there before, and in this Sutta this is said to be the principle behind the pleasure of Nibbāna. In the same way as not feeling the burden of the five aggregates and not being confined by them while the five aggregates are there is the pleasure of Nibbāna for an Arahant, [no longer feeling the burden of lust for the five cords of sensual pleasure and not being confined by them while they’re still perceived](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an9.42) is the pleasure of the first jhāna (ditto for the others) and this is why even this can be sufficient to attain Arahantship if there is sufficient wisdom. Mindfulness in the proper sense is what enables all of this.

>‘Sensual pleasures in the present and in the future, sensual perceptions in the present and in the future; both of these are Māra’s domain, Māra’s realm, and Māra’s territory. They conduce to bad, unskillful qualities such as longing, ill will, and impulsivity. And they create an obstacle for a noble disciple training here. Why don’t I abide with an *abundant, expanded mind, having surmounted the world and stabilized the mind*? Then I will have no more bad, unskillful qualities such as longing, ill will, and impulsivity. And by giving them up my mind will be *boundless, limitless,* and well developed.’ —MN 106

(...)

>From that, it’s been further argued that because the suttas devote more space to the practice of using thought to abandon unskillful qualities and to develop skillful qualities than it does to absorptive practices like mindfulness of breathing, that kind of thought most deserves to be called right concentration.

There are no “absorptive practices” in the Suttas, and Ānāpānasati is no exception. This becomes clear enough if we, having put aside all the baggage of modern interpretations, carefully consider what *sati* is to begin with as above, and why the Buddha might have chosen that term instead of something more in line with the idea of absorption.

The breath serves as particularly suitable anchor that *prevents* absorption, since it perpetually and inevitably underlies every moment of our experience. No matter how captivated you become in an object of your attention, whether physical or mental, all you need to restore the overview of the totality of your present experience is remember that you’re breathing—that sits “at the bottom” of everything else. At the basic level, this enables the mind to regain perspective over the ongoing movements of *vitakkavicāra*; it doesn’t *replace* them. It allows for discernment of *paṭiccasamuppāda* or [simultaneous inter-dependence](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=sn12.67#sn12.67:7.2-sn12.67:7.4) too, which is said to be the cornerstone of the Dhamma: it becomes clear that you can only have even the most personal and dear of thoughts and perceptions because you continue to breathe, which is in itself not a guarantee.

If, however, you turn the breath into a preoccupation of its own to focus on, the entire purpose of it is lost. You are no longer mindful in the right sense, and your mind is now constricted again, by something else. The point is to achieve balance, where neither the breath nor particular thoughts and sense objects are allowed to take the mind’s full focus, and this is what keeps it expanded. This aligns with the general principle of mindfulness of the body, which is said to be [like a strong post that keeps any of the six senses from dragging all of the others into their respective domains, while also making the mind limitless](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.247/en/sujato?lang=en). Similarly, the final result of *ānāpānasati* is that the six senses “sit down” and no longer pull towards or away from disagreeable objects **which are still there**, and not that some or all of the senses fall asleep. Mindfulness of breathing is therefore something that one can maintain one’s whole waking life if one is diligent, as instructed in SN 47.20. If it has been fully developed, it would [effortlessly remain up until one’s last breath](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn62#mn62:30.2). If the breath were meant to be an object of focus, this would be unrealistic, and would seriously hamper one’s ability to function.

There are several other tangible examples in the Suttas that illustrate the general nature of *sati*, and how no absorption or concentration involved or associated with it. Among them are [AN 6.19 ](https://suttacentral.net/an6.19/en/sujato?lang=en)and [AN 6.26](https://suttacentral.net/an6.26/en/sujato), and both of these tie in with AN 11.9 quoted above, where right meditation is said to be the opposite direction of intent observation and mechanical repetition. AN 6.26 even contains the same phrase found at the beginning of the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta, and it is clear that none of those recollections are things that one can fixate one’s attention on in the way the *satipaṭṭhānas* are typically practiced. In SN 3.13, it's not hard to see that for the king practicing mindfulness meant keeping a broader perspective while eating.

The sensible, unbiased conclusion is not that the Buddha taught a different type of mindfulness that is so different from the general standard that it deserves a different name altogether, but that absorptive practices are simply a misinterpretation enabled by the ambiguity of the texts, a failure even by respected scholars to take the entire canon into account and try to extract a single, internally coherent message from it—[which ought to be possible according to the Buddha himself](https://suttacentral.net/mn104/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=main&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin#5.2)—and perhaps most strongly by people’s natural tendency to lose perspective of what matters whenever something happens to feel good.

Moreover, increased powers of observation and focus, which is what absorptive practices develop, is not what allows for full understanding of the five aggregates. In fact, whenever you become absorbed in anything, you *forget* the form, feeling, perceptions, intentions, and consciousness that are the basis of that experience you are now immersed in, and that unseen basis is where the sense of self finds footing, not in what you observe in front of you. For example, if you allow yourself to become fixated on what you’re seeing, that automatically feeds into the tacit assumption that you *are* your eyes, i.e. form. If, on the other hand, you don’t focus too much on anything specific while sights are there, it becomes possible to consider how your eyes are also objects in the world, and that there is nothing ultimately preventing those eyes from deteriorating to the point where you’d lose your eyesight. The same applies of course for all the other sense bases.

This is how impermanence and the grave error of taking things as “mine” becomes revealed at the fundamental level. This will not happen through any perceptions, no matter how detailed, extraordinary, or refined, that are gleaned through direct observation (which, knowingly or not, only further maintains the tacit assumption of a separate “observer” behind the observation). And, in line with the above points, it is this same sense of being the center of experience that generates the burden of the five hindrances, so it’s wrong to think that observation is inadequate only in the context of *vipassanā* and not *samatha*.

We can thus begin to see how exactly the jhānas support understanding and intrinsically slant the mind towards Nibbāna and letting go in a much more profound way than soothing it through almost arbitrary means: the more one abides in the mere first jhāna, the more one is familiarizing the mind from a way of regarding things in which it is no longer the agent behind the senses. No matter the strength of one’s willpower to renounce sensual pleasures, until one is able to gain that separation from the senses and becomes used to it to the point where it becomes much more pleasant than wallowing in sensual preoccupations, one is liable to succumb to the pull of the five cords of sensuality. This is the true meaning of [this famous statement](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn14#mn14:4.2-mn14:4.3).

Finally, a few remarks on the so called “Jhāna Wars” that are prevalent these days:

One of the major culprits of this debate is that people assume that almost any pleasant meditative experience can be called jhāna, and this is taking things the wrong way round. Jhāna is the most refined aspect of the Middle Way, to the point that all the previous seven factors of the path are said to be its requisites (MN 117). Any given meditative state is either in line with that Middle Way, in which case it deserves to be called jhāna, or not, in which case it’s wrong samādhi. One of the most representative explanations of this middle way is found in [MN 134](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn134) (and is said there to be fundamental to the spiritual life): one does not nurture longing for any item of the five aggregates that hasn’t yet arisen, nor does one become complacent with those that are present. As SN 1.1 puts it: you don’t push forward, but you don’t stand still either.

If you’re trying to get the pleasure of jhāna to arise and the current discomfort to cease (e.g., by focusing on something more pleasant like the breath), justifying that as a “wholesome craving”, [you are longing for the future](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn134#mn134:8-13.4-mn134:8-13.5). If, on the other hand, you throw your hands up with the view that there is nothing to attain, don’t strive to free the mind from hindrances, and let your mind go wherever it wants in choiceless awareness, [you allow yourself to be dragged along by presently arisen phenomena](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn134#mn134:8-13.9-mn134:8-13.10). This means that there is by definition only one “real” set of jhānas forming the 8th factor of the Noble Path, and only one way to achieve them: neither pushing forward, nor standing still, completely and to the full extent. This is why every true jhāna is always categorically wholesome.

What every approach to jhāna that gets compared in the ongoing debate does is arbitrarily justify some forms of pushing forward and some forms of standing still, meaning that craving is still there even if only subtly. The attained pleasure is not born of the temporary cessation of craving and appropriation, making it a temporary liberation of mind, and a way of [“touching the deathless element with the body”](https://suttacentral.net/an6.46/en/thanissaro?lang=en&reference=none&highlight=false”), but simply a way of successfully gratifying one’s craving with something comparatively less detrimental than external pleasures. It is also not in line with the first factor of the path, right view, which recognizes that what you feel (*vedanā*, pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral) at any given time is not the problem, but rather the simultaneously present craving to change what you feel in one way or the other.

How, then, do you then go by the middle? Mindfulness: you establish your mind in a broader context that will prevent you from being carried away by what is present, but, at the same time, since it exists in a different plane than thoughts and perceptions of the five senses, does not require replacing or interfering with them. Establishing and protecting that context requires effort, so it’s not a matter of total letting go to the point of negligence, but it’s not a strained effort either because any kind of strain only comes when you try to control the specifics of your present experience instead of your context towards it.

The right, balanced practice is not something you get to subjectively decide; it is predetermined by the nature and workings of experience itself. This is why the Buddha said the Dhamma is an ancient path that he discovered; he didn’t create or devise his own idiosyncratic Middle Way, and neither can anybody else.

The fact that the practice of jhāna is fundamentally about aligning oneself with the unchanging principle of the middle path and of right mindfulness, and not about the pleasure that secondarily results from it, can be seen from the otherwise inexplicable statements in [this chapter](https://suttacentral.net/an1.394-574/en/sujato?lang=en) of the Aṅguttara Nikāya. There it’s said that any form of contextualizing one’s experience taught by the Buddha, many having nothing directly to do with jhāna, would make one “not devoid of jhāna” if practiced even for a fingersnap, and the pleasure of jhāna will obviously not come in a fingersnap for anyone initially. The statement only holds if any of these practices is done properly, i.e., with the right mindfulness that contextualizes things instead of pushing them away and replacing them.

From what’s been said so far, it can also become clear why in the Buddha’s outline of the training (MN 107), jhāna comes up only at a late stage, and the first task is always virtue to develop virtue. He even said that for one who lacks virtue, the vital condition for samādhi is destroyed (AN 5.24).

Proper virtue is the most rudimentary application of the Middle Way. It’s not only about keeping the training rules externally unbroken, but also, paradoxically at first glance, about not clinging to them (MN 48). In other words, the attitude with which one keeps the precepts also needs to be rightly tuned: consistently saying “no” to all forms of misconduct without thereby saying “yes” to one’s saying no. You will inevitably have to cling to your virtue at first to make it spotless. But the goal is to be able to keep it perfectly without clinging to it. Otherwise, as the Suttas explicitly say, it won’t be the kind of virtue that can evolve into *samādhi*.

Lastly, it must be emphasized that the actual Sutta jhānas are not "lite jhānas". They are much more profound and transcendental, but in a different sense, than the most intensely fixed states of absorption regarded as jhāna today. Their profundity is owing to the subtlety, nuance, and quasi-paradoxical nature of the Middle Way: how, in the midst of ample movement, the mind can be still. In the midst of mundanity, the mind is established in the supramundane, and this is why they inevitably carry over to one’s normal life even if one doesn’t want them to.

    [This except from an old talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nz9a1dYdN0), in light of what was said here, serves to illustrate how the jhānas are ***already*** “an island that no flood can overwhelm” (temporarily of course), which is why they're said to be the way to “touch the deathless element with the body” (AN 6.46).

    >“Bhikkhus, the uninstructed worldling speaks of ‘the ocean, the ocean.’ But that is not the ocean in the Noble One’s Discipline; that is only a great mass of water, a great expanse of water.

    >“The eye, bhikkhus, is the ocean for a person; its tide consists of forms. One who withstands that tide consisting of forms is said to have crossed the ocean of the eye with its waves, whirlpools, sharks, and demons. Crossed over, gone beyond, the brahmin stands on high ground.

    >“The ear, bhikkhus, is the ocean for a person…. The mind is the ocean for a person; its tide consists of mental phenomena. One who withstands that tide consisting of mental phenomena is said to have crossed the ocean of the mind with its waves, whirlpools, sharks, and demons. Crossed over, gone beyond, the brahmin stands on high ground.”  
    —SN 35.228

    As pleasant as it may be, a state where the tides disappear from view is of no help in understanding how to properly withstand them.

    But it is perfectly self-explanatory why it is beneficial to frequently abide in a state where not being affected by the tides ***is*** what’s pleasant.

### Citta "being-in-relation-to" phenomena

Dear Bhante Anigha,

I was reading your recent essay "Unyoked from biology" and I had a question on footnote #11, regarding Citta

>And this is why the *citta,* despite this special status, cannot rightly be considered a “soul”, a “self”, or “mine”. In order to be so, it would need to be able to stand on its own feet and not be liable to change, but its very defining trait is that of “being-in-relation-to” other phenomena that are inherently impermanent and bound for destruction, after which there could not be a *citta* in relation to them.

How should this be understood in reference to 'Mano pubbangama dhamma'. Since the mind is the forerunner of all phenomena, does this not imply that it is the phenomena that are 'in-relation-to' the Citta rather than the other way ?

Also, wouldn't 'Citto pubbangama dhamma' be a more accurate phrase to describe the relationship? Or is this verse just an example of where mano and citta are used synonymously.

Thanks in advance for your clarification 🙏

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1dxabl7/citta_beinginrelationto_phenomena/lc11qte/)** _2024-07-07 11:58:39_:

    >Or is this verse just an example of where mano and citta are used synonymously.

    It is. The verse refers to the fact that taking an external point of view to your own experience is impossible; every phenomenon you can conceivably cognize has to exist with your mano as basis, both as a mere sense base (as you wouldn't be able to see sights without your eyes) and also in the sense of citta (there cannot *not* be an attitude of greed or non-greed, aversion or non-aversion, and delusion or non-delusion in relation to every phenomenon, and that attitude also precedes them and is more general than them). There is no "outside" to this, not even in the farthest corners of the universe.

### Is Painful Practice Avoidable?

### For Ven. Anigha.  What is Pali/Sanskrit term for "Context"?

Venerable Anigha,  (or anyone who knows).

I am not 100% certain that I get all the subleties of the frequently used teaching of a "context" in HH videos and teachings.

Is there a pali or sanskrit word? Is there such a concept in the suttas,  Abhidhamma, *Abhidharma-kośa*, or commentaries (*translated to English*)?

Is it *avijñaptirūpa*?  If "context" isn't a conscious mental state, is it citta-viprayukta-saṃskāra?  Is "context" a specific prāpti  of Sabhāgatā of specific concept  of context?

Thank you!

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1dlg93a/for_ven_anigha_what_is_palisanskrit_term_for/l9pvnbp/)** _2024-06-22 04:00:14_:

    There's more than one word that semantically corresponds to it, although it isn't a literal rendering of any particular word.

    All the derivatives of *anu + pass* (*anupassī* as in satipaṭṭhāna; *samanupassanā*; *samanupassati*) are the first that come to mind. A lot of the time that's interpreted as "observation", but you cannot "observe" the 4 Noble Truths in satipaṭṭhāna as the Buddha instructs in the way you would observe a chair. They are contexts.

    "Context" would also correspond to _saññā_ in some cases where it's not being strictly used as one of the aggregates. When the Buddha uses terms like _pahānasaññā, virāgasaññā_ and _sabbaloke anabhiratasaññā_, he's talking about contexts, just as when he says _anicce dukkha_, _anattasaññā_, etc.

### Can someone define the word “context” as used in the HH videos?

It seems as if the term is referring to a specific parameter of “context”, phenomenological, ethical, dhammic, etc., but each time I think I understand, I encounter a video that seems to have a different nuance to it. Any clarification will be appreciated. 

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1dlcxyq/can_someone_define_the_word_context_as_used_in/l9q30gl/)** _2024-06-22 05:08:56_:

    When you're in the supermarket and there's a knowledge floating "at the back of your mind" that you're supposed to be back home by a certain time, that's a context. 

    When we refer to context, we refer to that overall "direction" of experience, not to something specific within that direction. And the reason why it's important is because it's that same direction—on a subtler but simultaneous plane to less fundamental contexts like the one above—that craving and all wholesome and unwholesome states are found. They are never found at the plane of, say, your visual perceptions of shapes and colors at the cleaning aisle of the supermarket.

    It sounds awfully trivial, but most people overlook that to one degree or another in the way they practice.

### Clarification regarding HH descriptions of MN10

Note: I am posting this on request from Venerable Anigha, who will post his response at some point soon.  The perspective I outlined here is, after reading his response, obviously derived from more contemporary perspectives of anapanasati.  I think it's pretty easy to see how I built up this perspective regarding what Ajahn Nyanamoli is talking about, and Venerable Anigha does a great job of explaining why it is incorrect.  From my own experience, what I've outlined here more or less feels like juggling -- he brought up the simile of the mountain cow, and its relevance is quite obvious.  My perspective was obviously wrong somewhere, but without giving up the idea of "moving" from point A to B to C, etc, I don't think I would have ever come around to what is actually meant.  I think that this post -- and his response -- will be very useful for clearing up wrong notions about the practice of anapanasati, especially since I've dove pretty deep into the wrong pond.   With all that said, feel free to contribute your own thoughts about anything I've said, the only goal here is to learn and hopefully help others to connect the dots as well - I'm sure the perspective I've outlined here will be shared by some readers to varying extents (and to many, be obviously incorrect, in which case your input is especially encouraged).

In MN10, the sutta states: He trains like this: ‘I’ll breathe in calming the bodily activity.’ He trains like this: ‘I’ll breathe out calming the bodily activity.’

Now, in this video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI0GVhw0bgs&list=PLUPMn2PfEqIwuLnCiCoXvgcD89ZQj9TKi&index=2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI0GVhw0bgs&list=PLUPMn2PfEqIwuLnCiCoXvgcD89ZQj9TKi&index=2) \[Recollectedness of Breathing | Revisiting Anapanasati Meditation Practice\]

Ajahn seems to describe this as being recollected of the presence of calm in your present experience.

In this essay: [https://www.hillsidehermitage.org/notes-on-meditation/](https://www.hillsidehermitage.org/notes-on-meditation/)

It seems to be described more along the lines of -- while I know that I am breathing, I maintain an intention (through recollection) to calm the body through breathing.

In this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwRqWW79kFg&list=PLUPMn2PfEqIwuLnCiCoXvgcD89ZQj9TKi&index=6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwRqWW79kFg&list=PLUPMn2PfEqIwuLnCiCoXvgcD89ZQj9TKi&index=6) \[How to calm your mind\]

It seems to center around calming of your aversion to enduring the experience that arises within your recollected state of mind.

To me, the last point would be: as I know I am breathing, and phenomena are arising in the middle space between the breathing body and my abstract sense of self, seen in this way, they endure as they are, rather than becoming the center, or totality of your present awareness. And in this way, you endure these things as they have presented themselves, even if that is unpleasant. More or less, the act of turning away or ignoring does have some level of effect on your experience of a particular sense object or phenomena, and by not engaging with that, you are kind of tackling something you are averse to in its full-form, which is naturally unpleasant. So in the last video, he is talking about how to make THAT experience calm, it's not the same as the line "he trains... tranquilizing bodily formations."

So with all of this in mind, my interpretation of the sutta, in terms of the proper way to actually establish the recollection of calming (and make your body calm) would be this way, structurally:

* As you are aware of the totality of the situation
* And your primary point of recollection is that you must endure, not try to change that which arises
* You are aware of the phenomena of the breathing body enduring on its own, and you understand its significance as the basis of your experience from prior contemplation
* You establish the intention to calm your body with each breath.

So the full weight of your intentionality, which is the (only?) direct way we can control the body, is leaning the experience of breathing towards calming the body. That which arises within the experience as phenomena follow with the bodily response to calm, even if it doesn't necessarily feel "right." More or less, establishing and maintaining this recollection (in the structure I described) is the ultimate way to calm your body. In terms of our control, there is nothing more that can be done. And hence, your best bet is to maintain this recollection and keep at it, if you want to calm your physical body.

Is my interpretation accurate? I would say that it still kind of clashes with my understanding of what is described in \[Recollectedness of Breathing | Revisiting Anapanasati Meditation Practice\], but is the most concordant with my own experiences. Because we really do have a direct level of control, the point is just that the particulars of our experience MUST be arising due to more primary physical processes. Hence, "breath-watching," despite being legitimately the most refined type of sensuality (and so in a mundane sense, for the average worldly person, being quite a good and even elevated thing) is really just hiding from and maintaining your own liability to acting out of / appropriating disagreeable, on a more fundamental level. That type of practice essentially says "the problem is in the objects" when the problem is really craving and one's continued liability to it. For somebody with no interest in going beyond, the problem more or less is in the objects, since they don't want to face them or endure them, it's just all about feeling good right now and forever, all the time.

So this practice of calming the body is really just the healthiest way to establish the mind in terms of letting your body relax, it's more effective for calming than absorption (it has to be, if you can't go further than your intention) and doesn't require your direct sense of control in the domain of particular sense objects (another reason why it would have greater efficacy). Perhaps what was meant in the first video is that, as you are aware of calming, you are aware of calm as a phenomena. But the explanation seemed to be closer to: you attend to the calm, and disregard the not-calm. But I don't think this is what was meant.

So overall, it seems like we have two categories of "calming" 1) The sutta description, which refers to calming the body and its events - might also include attending to the presence of calm in the body, which I would take to mean being recollected of the fact that as you have this or that unpleasant experience arise, you simultaneously know that the majority of your body is totally calm, kind of putting the discomfort into a greater perspective. 2) Calming of endurance, which is a mental calming, not a bodily calming.

    If you're keen on approaching the right view by trying to understand how APS is properly practiced, I would strongly advise sticking to the instructions on the topic found in Ajahn Nyanamoli's two books. If they seem overly terse or somehow inadequate, it's only because they haven't been sufficiently understood, not because anything was omitted.

    >The knowledge of breathing in and out doesn’t require any special effort.

    The bottom line is that none of the 16 different possibilities of ānāpānasati practice should be regarded as fundamentally distinct or separate from the others. If you are doing the core of it properly, "recollected he breathes in; recollected he breathes out", you are doing all of them implicitly. In this case, simply enduring the hindrances properly on a mental level, making no direct effort to calm your body (which is always treading on thin ice for someone without the right view) is sufficient for all the bodily calm you really need, factually: the calm of your six senses ceasing to pull towards and away from their objects as in the simile of the six animals, which is exactly the same as you would get from any other form of sati whatsoever (and that is basically the first jhāna). Only once you truly have that (by which point you would've already gotten the right view long ago) can you go further and start emphasizing and "training" in any one of the sixteen aspects.

    So if there's a sense that you need to do "more" and then you act out of that, then right then and there the basic recollection of breathing is not properly established, for if it were it would prevent you from acting out of hindrances. It's like [the simile of the mountain cow](https://suttacentral.net/an9.35/en/sujato?lang=en) who falls between the two rocks because she didn't properly set her foot on the first and hastily went for the second one.

    If you were actually settled in the "basic" anapanasati, you would already be abiding in immaculate contentment [free from hindrances](https://suttacentral.net/sn54.6/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin), and you would take it further not because your mind *wants* you to like before, but because you rationally understand that it'll take you closer to Arahantship (and at that point you would see for yourself what that means, i.e. be at least a sotāpanna).

    >See your breath as something happening underneath whatever else is going on. “Underneath” because it will feel so from the point of view of whatever you are occupied with. “Underneath” because, although at the same time, it is “before”, it is more primordial and closer to the body.

    Be peripherally aware of breathing taking place “underneath” the desire to calm your body down, or anything else that wants you to get mentally engaged in one way or another, and simply sustain that no matter where your 5 senses and mind move.  See that and the breath as two completely unconnected, simultaneously enduring domains.\* There is no "...and then I go to step two".

    \* i.e., the knowledge that breathing is happening (which has nothing to do with sensations in your nostrils or anywhere else; you would still be able to know you're breathing even if all the tactile input was somehow cut off because it's an *action*) is present "underneath" bodily movements and vitakkavicāra about this or that; it should not be a *replacement* for that to any extent, in which case it automatically ceases to be *sati*. That's one of the main aspects where mainstream practices go astray.

### Why does HH and it's followers seem to be anti-meditation?

I am trying to understand if they are just critical of some types of meditation, or are against meditation practice as a whole.

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1djl80a/why_does_hh_and_its_followers_seem_to_be/l9f0qj5/)** _2024-06-20 04:27:20_:

    It's not that we discourage "meditation" (if we define that as the practice of calming the mind) categorically before stream-entry. The point that in order to have any real chance of leading to the right view, such efforts need to be an *attempt to understand* what meditation is, whereas for most teachers and traditions meditation involves taking for granted one's current understanding of what the defilements are, how they need to be abandoned, and what the goal even is, and that's a big mistake. Therefore, no matter how many years of diligent effort and resulting insights and skills one acquires, one’s *fundamental view* has remained mostly unchanged, and that means one has hardly "moved" along the path at all. Attempting to practice meditation with the context that one still doesn't understand what meditation is what nobody wants to do—nobody wants to put in the work to really dial in their running form before they actually start packing on miles—but at the end of the day it's not optional unless you want to get injured (fall into wrong samādhi, wrong knowledge, and wrong liberation). A stream-enterer is one who [knows how to meditate properly](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an1.51-60#an1.51:1.1-an1.52:1.4) (and has [*acquired* the seven enlightenment factors](https://suttacentral.net/sn46.30/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin) and the [Noble Eightfold Path](https://suttacentral.net/sn55.5/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin)).

    The second element is that the Suttas always present meditation (abiding in seclusion in an attempt to abandon the five hindrances) as a very late stage for which certain prerequisites need to be fulfilled, and that's because it's simply a more refined and subtle development of the *same principle* as all the previous steps of the Gradual Training. So our point that people shouldn't even try to practice meditation unless they've fulfilled those previous steps is akin to saying that you shouldn't try to lift 100 pounds if you can't even lift 20 with good technique, and [should instead focus on mastering 10, then 20, etc.](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn107#mn107:2.1-mn107:2.12) (unless, again, you want to injure yourself).

    Even though many teachers do place emphasis on virtue and sense restraint, it's almost always as an *aid* to meditation, and in the final analysis the "meat" of the practice they teach is something that goes in a different direction altogether than the practice of restraint "off the cushion", no matter how much they may emphasize it. The fact that one could even *theoretically* succeed in such practices without being developed in the 8 precepts and sense restraint means it's not in line with what's taught in the Suttas. It means it’s a type of mental development that can coexist with the five hindrances, and at least from the Buddha's point of view such a thing cannot rightly be called meditation. In the same vein, meditation and the pursuit of sensual pleasures are in most traditions more like "north and west", whereas according to the Suttas [they're north and south](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an9.41#an9.41:7.1-an9.41:7.15), meaning they're mutually incompatible.

    Lastly, sometimes people think the critique is directed only at "pure samatha" practices, but such a thing does not even exist (Dhp 372, [AN 6.73](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an6.73#an6.73:1.4)), and the belief that it *could* in itself shows that one’s view of meditation is off even if one personally doesn't practice in that way.

### Precepts

[deleted]

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1diyxhp/precepts/l9aa9in/)** _2024-06-19 09:38:00_:

    >Am I still making progress/merit by living this way? Is it possible to obtain right view without perfection of the precepts?

    You would make some progress and merit by taking on even one precept compared to none, but whether it's enough for the right view is a different question that cannot be answered except in hindsight, just like nobody can tell in advance whether cutting corners here and there in the construction of a building will still allow it to survive a future earthquake. All that can be said is that there are [guidelines](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn53#mn53:19.1-mn53:19.5) for proper construction laid down by experts, and that any deviation from that entails a gamble.

    Based on what you say, the main reason is not wanting to upset those around you, but it could be that that itself becomes an obstruction to stream entry although it's not as coarse as doing those acts out of pure individual desire (assuming you truly have 0 interest and passion for them internally, which is not a given). Even then, it would still very much partake in the five hindrances, and they are precisely what obstructs the realization of the Dhamma, perpetuating the wrong tacit assumption that unpleasant feeling (e.g., of others being upset with you owing to your practice) is suffering in itself.

### Questions on the yoniso manasikāra essay

>The puthujjana lacks even the correct understanding of what yoniso manasikāra is - ayoniso manasikāra is the very reason for his self-view.

>Before that \[attaining the right view\], the effort is to learn what yoniso manasikāra is, and keep taking one's present understanding of it with a pinch of salt.

>The goal of yoniso attention is to see that whole \_this\_, one's entire world, as within, as being fully dependent on, secondary to, simultaneously originated from (paṭiccasamuppanna) another \*this\*. This will automatically prevent you from assuming yourself as the origin, the owner, the master of this experience - of this attention. It will truly prevent assuming as yours anything that you can attend to.

I have read the essay several times. Yet, I am not sure I have understood it properly...

A) Can the practical instructions for the development of right mindfulness and attention given in the essays peripherical awareness and yoniso manasikaara be resumed as follows: *The anchor (as presented in the peripherical awareness essay) is the pivot post use to keep attention at the proper distance in order to see simultaneously the anchor, the experience, and the womb of the experience (those three elements remain ungrasped, not over attended, and so kind of unfocused)?*

B) In terms of the essays yoniso manasikaara and peripherical awareness, if the anchor were the breath and the womb the body: how one should understand and develop "sampajañña"?

C) When one has overattended an object, due to begin interested in it, then one has stepped into ayoniso attention. Once this is realized, should one trace back the sequence of attentions and experiences that leaded into this overattention, or just regain the yoniso attention and keep going?

D) As I understood, there are different layers and elements of ones experience, and thus different layers of wombs, some more general (that include all the experience), some more concrete (like a womb of one mental object of the whole experience).

>Now, the question arises: what exactly is that broader phenomenon that one must discern in regard to one's attention, so that attention itself will be seen as "not mine".

>The four satipaṭṭhānas are four general aspects that can be interchangeably discerned as the "womb" (yoni) or "container" of this experience as a whole, so that I can no longer assume that experience as within me. The most practical example would be in terms of the body.

In order to practice and develop yoniso, is it better to stick for long to one of the most generals wombs - the body - as a fixed context, or is it convenient to attend to a wider range of general-and-concrete wombs depending on what experience is going on?

pd: the footnote 11 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5\_57craC) is incorrect link

    You're not trying to see three things simultaneously, nor even two. It's more like peripheral awareness allows you to see the full picture of your *one* present experience, and without it you would immediately become immersed in particular sense objects and preoccupations, and being immersed (*avijjā*) is the root of passion and aversion.

    >B) In terms of the essays yoniso manasikaara and peripherical awareness, if the anchor were the breath and the womb the body: how one should understand and develop "sampajañña"?

    "The anchor" and "the womb" are not two different things.

    Unequivocally the latter. You can’t "trace back the sequence of attentions" accurately even if you try because experience is not a sequence to begin with, and by such attempts you would be severely misconceiving it.

    It sounds like you're over-complicating and over-rationalizing it. Think about it like this:

    The whole reason why the metaphor of an "anchor" is used is because you're not supposed to be constantly attending to it. A fisherman isn’t holding the anchor *and* the fishing rod at the same time.

    When you initially go into seclusion, you think for a moment about whichever context you feel inclined to use that day. Let’s say you're choose to be mindful of your posture. So you have to actually *attend* to the fact that you’re walking and clearly recognize that that is the background of your experience for this duration of time whether or not you think about it. That's setting up the anchor. Then you let your mind think about whatever—the fisherman forgets about the anchor, but obviously the anchor is still there. No matter how deeply you go into your thoughts, you have at least a tiny 1% of the recognition that you *are* walking while you’re thinking, and that recognition doesn't require active maintenance. You *have* to stop actively holding on to the anchor for it to actually do its job.

    At some point however, you will all of a sudden realize that you completely forgot about the fact that you were walking and lost even that 1% recognition, the anchor. ***Then*** you set it up again, and let it drift into the background once more ... until at some point the same thing happens. That’s all.

    And there’s a reason why virtue and withdrawal from sensuality need to be established as your default state *before* you even try to practice this. That will ensure that you can actually let your mind roam around within the anchor for a while without it instantaneously jumping back to sensuality and ill will, as it otherwise would. That's why the satipaṭṭhāna stock passage always says “\[he practices like this\] ***having subdued*** longing and upset in regard to the world”. Suttas like AN 8.63 and SN 46.6 point out that your mind needs to be "steadied internally" (as a result of virtue and sense restraint) *before* you engage in any mindfulness practice, not the other way around as people usually take it (which is where "concentration" comes in—a contrived artifice to work around the prerequisites not being met).

    Another way of looking at it that would be more palpably connected to the abandoning of defilements what's described in [SN 35.246](http://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=sn35.246), but the principle is exactly same. The caretake beats the ox *when it wanders into the crops*, not constantly. 

    Edit: (And just to repeat, forget about trying to "catch" the moment when you lost the anchor. It simply doesn't work like that; the realization that you lost it will always come out of the blue, and you won't be able to remember how long you've been unmindful for. That would require you to have a point of view that exists outside of your five aggregates, and that's impossible even for an Arahant).

### Extent of precepts leading to sense restraint

In the comments on a [recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1d32drw/sense_restraint_how_hard_to_push_what_about_when/), u/Bhikkhu_Anigha wrote:

>Unless you see no further work to do in regard to the 8 precepts, you shouldn't be worrying about sense restraint to begin with.

Can you clarify what the extent of the 8 precepts that needs to be fulfilled is that would "make it worthwhile" to think about how to and apply sense restraint.

Does that extent include bodily and verbal domains? Or is being unable to refrain from engaging with any sensual thought ("finding myself" thinking/fantasizing but not  to the point of considering bodily acts) without fail a breach of the precepts? As I understand, this is the point where the welcoming, delighting etc. could be recognized and while not thinking I am doing it rightly at least be able to try to find the balance between accepting the pull/aversion and trying to deny/remove it.

[SN 35.98](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.98/en/bodhi?lang=en&reference=none&highlight=false):

>And how, bhikkhus, is there restraint? There are, bhikkhus, forms cognizable by the eye that are desirable, lovely, agreeable, pleasing, sensually enticing, tantalizing. If a bhikkhu does not seek delight in them, does not welcome them, and does not remain holding to them, he should understand this thus: ‘I am not declining away from wholesome states. For this has been called nondecline by the Blessed One.’

Or does understanding "I am not declining away from wholesome" imply that one needs right view to be able to apply (or try to understand) any of this?

    >Can you clarify what the extent of the 8 precepts that needs to be fulfilled is that would "make it worthwhile" to think about how to and apply sense restraint.

    Simply that occasions where you break them are exceptions rather than the norm, and you no longer feel like you're constantly on the verge of succumbing to the pull on the bodily and verbal level as you would have initially.

    As I mentioned in another post as well, in the beginning there's no problem with "blindly" avoiding seeing or hearing things if it helps you keep the precepts. It's just that one shouldn't fall into a view that that alone is sense restraint, which does require understanding (awareness of the present mental state and how what you choose to deliberately attend to or engage with will influence it).

### Signs and features & hints of the mind

Hello, could you help me shed some light on this please: are the "signs and features" and "hints/signs of the mind" totally different things that should not be put in the same bag or are they two sides of the same coin?

As I understand it, the "signs and features" are associated with perception:

>The signs and features of a thing are not just the particular sensory perceptions of it (shape, color, texture, etc.), but also the entire “world” of significances, feelings, memories, associations, ideas, and intentions associated with it

>-- [Restraining the senses (from Bhikkhu Anigha)](https://www.hillsidehermitage.org/restraining-the-senses/)

But I understand the "hints/signs of the mind" as rather associated with the state of mind, as what is giving away the current state of mind: a certain inclination towards certain types of thought, the speed and flow of these thoughts, even certain types of perceptions/feelings that are usually connected with a certain state of mind, the type of pressure and towards what it is pressuring me,  ..

But I also think that the definition of the former, namely `[the signs and features are] also the entire “world” of significances, feelings, memories, associations, ideas, and intentions associated with it` could be used in regard to the state of mind, in the sense that with a certain state of mind enduring there will be a certain feeling that will be more often present than another, certain memories/associations/ideas/intentions that will be more proeminent than others; or in other words: with a certain state of mind enduring, the mind as the tendency to grasp at certains signs and features rather than others.

How should it be understood?

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1dfnthv/signs_and_features_hints_of_the_mind/l8l0s33/)** _2024-06-14 14:18:40_:

    They're the same in principle, just that one grasping of signs has to stop and the other has to begin (and the stopping of the former is what allows the starting of the latter).

    When an unrestrained person perceives something they have strong lust or aversion for, their experience is overtaken by the significances and further characteristics and features related to that thing (what they would like to do with it, fantasies, etc.) Conversely, when someone tries to put their finger on what their mind actually is in the present experence—i.e., concretely and not in theory—there is either a total barrenness and lack of clarity, or abstract ideas that totally miss the mark. There are no “tokens” or characteristics they’re aware of by which they could confidently and without doubt say “this is how my mind is disposed at this moment”. Or, when they think they’re seeing the characteristics of their mind they actually aren’t, and are instead looking at secondary thoughts and sense objects.

    And [these](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn10#mn10:34.1-mn10:34.17) are the ways the mind can be disposed—it's as simple as that. Any more detailed or intricate theoretical explanations would correspond to sense objects and ideas, not to the mind that is present “behind” them there and then. “Grasping” those signs means knowing the indirect characteristics that would define a mind as passionate, averse, etc., and no longer mistakenly relying on the particular content of experience to determine that.

    For example, whoever doesn’t see the signs of their mind would tacitly assume that the presence of disagreeability and negative thoughts is what a hateful mind is. The actual hateful mind is something much subtler that is *peripheral to that* and endures simultaneously, which is why the starting point must be to not act out of aversion, and endure the lingering displeasure without suppressing it with “loving-kindness” mantras and so on.

### question about withdrawal from sensuality

So let me get this straight, when I try my best to avoid welcoming sensuality, and certain perceptions come and torment me, that is not some "energy" that is building up and that I need to release in some way, but rather the extent of infestation of my own addiction to sensuality, right? Sort of like the tide going away and revealing all the things that were underneath, the depravations, the strange beliefs, the neurotic compulsions. All the things that lived rent-free because of my addiction and gratifying of sensuality that made me unaware to them, numb to them. Am I on the right track here?

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1ddj3o1/question_about_withdrawal_from_sensuality/l88w6lr/)** _2024-06-12 09:48:45_:

    Right, and it's also important to realize that the "addiction "to sensuality is not a purely bodily affair, unlike a drug addiction. The problem is not limited to the mere arising of sensual bodily urges, for otherwise getting old (or even just living in a remote forest for the rest of one's life) would automatically diminish the addiction.

    The core of sensuality is *mentally valuing* the pleasure that is offered to your senses, which means that once you get old and the "weight" of sensual pleasure ceases to even be cognized, it actually becomes much harder, not easier, to train your mind to overcome the addiction properly. It's much easier to ignore your liability to it and pretend like you're more equanimous just because the triggers of sensual craving no longer arise as intensely.

    But the good news is that mentally valuing sensual pleasure is completely up to you, and it's a choice that you can learn to refrain from making on sequentially more refined levels (which is what the Gradual Training is about).

### Is Craving a Dhamma?

Trying to understand what 'Dhamma' (when translated as 'phenomena') actually means. What's the necessary condition for something to be called a Dhamma? 

Is Craving (Tanha) a Dhamma? What about Ignorance (avijja)? Are the five aggregates five different Dhammas? What about clinging with respect to the aggregates? Is that a Dhamma too? Or are there five different clinging Dhammas, one for each aggregate?

Thanks.

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1db066g/is_craving_a_dhamma/l7rvdvr/)** _2024-06-09 04:43:26_:

    >What's the necessary condition for something to be called a Dhamma?

    The ability to be called *something* (i.e., the fact that it is manifest in any shape or form). In other words, saying that something cannot be called a Dhamma is a contradiction in terms: you are then and there designating it in that way, which means the thing is manifest in your experience to that extent.

    Having said that, it's true that people's definition or conception of what dhammas or phenomena are is generally quite deficient. The natural tendency is to think in terms of *sense* *objects*, and whatever cannot be directly observed in that way would tend to be dismissed and regarded as not real, or as abstract at the very least (and that often serves as a shortcut towards *anattā*: the self is supposedly "not real" just because it cannot be seen the way a chair can). 

    But things like craving, ignorance, and the five aggregates are most certainly not sense objects, and yet they're also perfectly concrete and presently knowable if one learns to see them for what they are, in their "indirectness", which is the only way they can arise. Making them "more palpable" through direct attention makes them cease to be what they were.

    To use one of Ajahn Nyanamoli's similes, it's like stars on a clear night sky that you can only see when you're looking at *other* stars. Once you try to look at them directly, they disappear. You wouldn't say that those stars that can only be seen with your peripheral vision "don't exist"; they are dhammas that manifest *as peripheral.*

    [This talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yptLIdi1JW8) is quite relevant to this topic.

### “Rebirth by choice”? 



I’m curious if you have given any thought to aspiring to “this or that” rebirth? I know other traditions emphasize this more but I’d like to hear what this sub thinks about it. 

Speaking for myself, I have so far figured that it doesn’t really matter what realm I aspire towards — in other words, I’ll just let my kamma take me wherever it “has to” take me. While trusting that keeping a solid morality will have good results. 

But then I came across the sutta below, which made me think that perhaps I should give this more thought. I may not reach Nibbana in this life, so maybe it’s wise to think about where I would prefer to go next. (Though I’m not very familiar with all these strange realms the suttas speak of!) 

What about you, do you have any thoughts on this?  

Best wishes,

-

Excerpt from “Rebirth by Choice”, MN 120 
translated by Bhikkhu Sujato ; 

”At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, “Mendicants!”

“Venerable sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this:

“I shall teach you rebirth by choice. Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”

“Yes, sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this:

“Take a mendicant who has faith, ethics, learning, generosity, and wisdom. They think: ‘If only, when my body breaks up, after death, I would be reborn in the company of well-to-do aristocrats!’ They settle on that thought, stabilize it and develop it. Those choices and meditations of theirs, developed and cultivated like this, lead to rebirth there. This is the path and the practice that leads to rebirth there.

Furthermore, take a mendicant who has faith, ethics, learning, generosity, and wisdom. They think: ‘If only, when my body breaks up, after death, I would be reborn in the company of well-to-do brahmins … well-to-do householders.’ They settle on that thought, stabilize it and develop it. Those choices and meditations of theirs, developed and cultivated like this, lead to rebirth there. This is the path and the practice that leads to rebirth there.

Furthermore, take a mendicant who has faith, ethics, learning, generosity, and wisdom. And they’ve heard: ‘The Gods of the Four Great Kings are long-lived, beautiful, and very happy.’ They think: ‘If only, when my body breaks up, after death, I would be reborn in the company of the Gods of the Four Great Kings!’ They settle on that thought, stabilize it and develop it. Those choices and meditations of theirs, developed and cultivated like this, lead to rebirth there. This is the path and the practice that leads to rebirth there.” 

…. then it goes on like this through the rest of the Brahma realms, and all the way to Nibbana. 


- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1d8x7rc/rebirth_by_choice/l7h1ukz/)** _2024-06-07 02:51:06_:

    Firstly, it should be noted that "choices", "thought", and "meditation" here are misleading translations. The first is *saṅkhāra*, which is more like intention or even "inclination" in this context. The second is *citta*, which is something that arises of its own accord and you cannot directly fabricate unlike a thought (*vitakka*), and the third is *vihāra*, which simply means "abiding", not "meditation". Also, the phrasing "They think: ‘If only...’" makes it sound like it's something he's intentionally choosing to bring to mind, but the Pāli is "tassa evaṃ hoti", which simply means "For him there is thus:".

    Paired with the statement, that faith, virtue, learning, generosity (or more like relinquishment, *cāga,* since it's a bhikkhu), and especially understanding are necessary, this changes the picture significantly. It means that one must develop one's mind (citta) to the point where it would factually on its own incline in that direction and possess the characteristics defining that rebirth, and *then* cultivate further resolve and determination towards that ("taṃ cittaṃ dahati, taṃ cittaṃ adhiṭṭhāti, taṃ cittaṃ bhāveti").

    Furthermore, one will most likely never reach the necessary level of these wholesome qualities if from the start one delights in rebirth. [MN 16](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn16) states:

    >When a bhikkhu has not given up these five obstinacies and cut off these five shackles of mind, **it’s not possible for him to achieve growth, improvement, or maturity in this teaching and discipline.**

    >...

    >He leads the renunciate life for the sake of a certain heavenly existence, thinking: ‘By this precept or observance or fervent austerity or renunciate life, may I become one of the gods!’ This being so, his mind doesn’t incline to diligence, dedication, persistence, and striving. This is the fifth shackle of mind he hasn’t cut off. These are the five shackles of mind he hasn’t cut off.

    So the scenario being described here is not that of an ordinary beginner who simply decides they want to be reborn in such and such realm and magically ends up realizing that aspiration. It's someone who got to the point where they are at (sotāpatti) by *not* delighting in being and pleasure of any kind and cultivating dispassion, but for one reason or another did not make it all the way to Arahantship, and by cultivating such determinations they would ensure that they, so to speak, reap no less than what they sowed (which could happen). It won't magically lead to results that they hadn't already earned.

    And even in the case of householders in the Suttas who managed to reach such a level of development, it was *through* dispassion and relinquishment. It's only afterwards that they often became complacent with that they had attained.

    >(1) Then the Buddha taught the householder Upāli step by step, with a talk on generosity, virtue, and heaven. (2) **He explained the woe, inferiority, and defilement of sensuality, and the benefit of renunciation**. (i.e. dispassion towards even the lofty realms)  
    (3) And when he knew that Upāli’s mind was ready, pliable, rid of hindrances, elated, and confident he explained the special teaching of the Buddhas: suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path. Just as a clean cloth rid of stains would properly absorb dye, in that very seat the stainless, immaculate eye of the Dhamma arose in Upāli: “Whatever has the nature of arising has the nature of ceasing.” Then Upāli saw, attained, understood, and fathomed the Dhamma. He went beyond doubt, got rid of indecision, and became self-assured and independent of others regarding the Teacher’s instructions.

    >“Well, Bhante, now I must go. I have many duties, and much to do.”

    —[MN 56](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn56)

### Why is the joy of relief absent?

I’ve been keeping the precepts, practicing contentment with little, not delighting in company, dwelling alone the majority of the time. There aren’t many actions anymore either, by body or speech, as I’ve seen so many are rooted in unwholesome intentions or distraction. I’ve been reading and rereading suttas and the essays and they are straightforward, directly applicable to me.

But I feel something is *off.* I’m sleeping more, no doubt because of having little to *do.* I wonder if this is more of a depression, a nagging doubt fuelled by those I do see wondering why I’m not engaging in idle conversation anymore or sensual activities. It‘s like there is no interest in a vast amount of what previously occupied my day. So I’m just here with this pressure and discerning more and more subtle ways in which I’m ignoring it or trying to get rid of it, and it honestly feels like dying. Is this the practice? Do I just keep enduring this? 

And this may sound strange, but have I somehow obscured the place where the joy of renunciation *is?* There is clearly a sense of self that is maintained in the suttas, of mind, whatever you want to call it, a place that becomes free, experiences the relief of cessation, but I don’t *know* it? This is quite a bizarre predicament I find myself in. Everything is just very unevolving, I guess you could describe it, but it’s not pleasant - and that’s why there is this doubt I can’t shake and I’ve made this post.

Thank you in advance to anyone who makes a comment. This may be something one can only figure out for oneself directly, but perhaps there are others who have known something similar and can help.  


- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1d8v4a6/why_is_the_joy_of_relief_absent/l7h47td/)** _2024-06-07 03:08:44_:

    It's hard to judge solely based on what you wrote, but it could simply be that your very expectation that there should be pleasure is the reason why you're uneasy. The "relief" that you refer to is the relief of the absence of craving, and if you're looking forward to "something else" apart from what you have present, it means you're resisting the present feeling, and that's exactly what craving is.

    Of course, I'm not here endorsing the whole new-age "just be with the moment and give up all expectations" mumbo jumbo. What I'm saying is that once you have developed yourself in virtue and restraint, you need to start realizing that the suffering that's left there is due to your own out-of-tune attitude towards your own thoughts and mental states, that is either too lax (too indulgent and careless) or too tight (overly denying), and that's when you start overcoming the five hindrances correctly (which includes anticipation and expectation of any kind).

    If you try to give up these (at the time) subtler things *before* you're established in wholesome behavior, however, you will be disposing of the very drive that's meant to get you to where you need to be. Once you're there, though, you need to start distinguishing those (now) coarser, initially beneficial pressures as something that you shouldn't give in to, *without* allowing that to take you all the way back into indulgence and non-restraint.

### Pressure, craving, acting out of mind

To the question:

>Does that mean that when there is the sense of ownership, phassa entails cravings by default?

Bhante Anigha [answered](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/196a1us/comment/kht955q/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button):

>Yes. If there *were* no craving to *act* out of the pressure, you couldn't call it "pressure" or even "contact" anymore. In order for it to qualify as "pressure" in the first place, there needs to be craving in response to it, on account of a misguided ownership of things that arise on their own (ignorance).

>So it goes both ways, pressure is determined as what it is by craving (which is always *already there*, 24/7; [it doesn't "arise" at some mysterious point](https://suttacentral.net/an10.62/en/bodhi?lang=en&reference=none&highlight=false)), and conversely, craving could never be there if there were no pressure.

Does that mean that if someone is pressured but is capable of never acting out on the level of body or speech, he is nevertheless still acting out on the level of the mind, grasping at signs and features of perceptions that are connected to unwholesome states, and if he wasn't there wouldn't be any pressure with phassa/contact? (Or there wouldn't even be contact anymore?)

Or is acting out on the level of the mind something else?

I understand it as an intermediate stage that a trainee needs to go through, after being firmly established in virtue, in order to purify even the acting out on the level of the mind by essentially "keeping the guard post" as the simile goes, making the effort to not grasp at signs that are connected to unwholesome states and making the effort to attend to differents signs connected to wholesome states when one find itself already doing the former.

And because of that, by stopping to fuel the craving, and also by establishing a more and more persistent non-ignorant context that the problem isn't the feeling but the 'wanting more/less' of this feeling (that the feeling is a structural part of the experience where the 'wanting more/less' is added on top of it, unneccessary and above all, the source of these troubles), pressure will eventually not arise anymore.

Is this understanding correct?

    No, craving is not the same as grasping at signs and features (mental action). Actions rooted in passion, aversion, and distraction (hindrances) are what *fuels* craving (i.e., the pressure to perform more of such actions).

    You can successfully stop acting unwholesomely on all three levels at any given moment if you understand how to do so (which requires yoniso manasikāra, and of course prior development in virtue), but craving—which is a broad phenomenon, much more general than this or that thing you desire or hate—would only dissipate (temporarily even, as in samādhi) as a result of *sustaining* that restraint on all three levels of action long enough.

### Help me understand the phenomenology of wanting unpleasant feelings (contains self-harming)

From my understanding, if something is unpleasant, there is always a wanting to get rid of it. If something is pleasant, there is always a wanting to obtain it. Even if you have someone who says "no, I like being depressed, I feel comfortable in this emotion, it's all I've ever known" then *that* right there is a pleasant feeling that is wanted, or rather, the idea of being content provokes a feeling of uncertainty which is unpleasant and there is craving to get away from it. So from what I understand, unpleasant feeling exists on a scale, and less-unpleasant feelings are deemed desirable, or 'pleasant', and if one does not know this properly, you can easily get confused thinking you sometimes want unpleasant feeling which can only be a contradiction.

So something awfully bad happened to me the other night and I ended up self-harming. I haven't done this in 3 years, had no urge or interest in it that entire time, but due to a severe lack of sleep + unfortunate life event, I hit my threshold and to my utter surprise cut myself. I remember when I did it historically, it was very pleasant, and I was actually annoyed that the urge to do it vanished. I've woken up today completely tilted because I don't have the urge to self-harm, I'm annoyed it was a one-off. I seem to want the unpleasant feeling but I know this can't be the case...

What I can say is that in the past, I only self-harmed when things were incredibly bad, that made self-harming 'worth' it. It had to be serious enough. SH used to trigger feelings of comfort, self-care, validation, sense of control, a reliable escape. However, I could not, and cannot SH over something little or even mid, now THAT would be unpleasant. It would NOT cause feelings of comfort, self-care, validation and so on. If I were to do it now for no good reason, I would actually feel deflated, icky, stupid, ridiculous, silly, kind of like 'bruh wtf am I doing this for'.

So the only thing I can think of, is that historically I still very much delighted in the prospect of SHing, which means the unpleasant feeling was there, but because my mood was nowhere near bad enough, I know I couldn't do it without it causing feelings of shame. There seems to be a value judgement - I feel low and want to SH, but the idea of SHing whilst simply feeling low would make me feel even worse and I don't want that. In the past, there was a 'hope' of even worse things happening to me so I had an 'excuse' to have the urge to SH, which makes me believe the urge was already there from the start, just incredibly subtle... and me welcoming bad life events was the delighting in freedom from that unpleasant urge.

So ultimately what I believe is "me wanting unpleasant feelings" is actually just another case of me not wanting higher degrees of unpleasant feeling.

In the video "Why did the buddha say sensuality to be an assumption" Nyanamoli Thero mentioned how the idea of getting your desires met to avoid the future pain of not having them met, can only ever be done on the basis of already being subjected to the desire first. So from my understanding I cannot 'want' the 'wanting' to SH unless I subtly already want to SH in the first place.

And I just want to repeat that in those 3 years of not doing it, the "wanting of the wanting to SH" vanished, and I simply didn't think about it the whole time. From my understanding there was therefore truly no interest in doing it.

(I'm fine btw)

    >So ultimately what I believe is "me wanting unpleasant feelings" is actually just another case of me not wanting higher degrees of unpleasant feeling.

    Yes, it doesn't really matter that from a "public" point of view, self-harm should actually be unpleasant. What matters is that it does (or can) arise as pleasant *for you*. So it's not necessary to look at it in the context of *what* specifically your mind wants you to do in response to displeasure; what must be overcome is the common thread of inclining towards whatever actions give rise to pleasure *for you* in hopes of replacing or subduing the displeasure of things that are unpleasant *for you*. Phenomenologically speaking (which is all that matters in the context of the Dhamma), *why* something is pleasant or pleasant is irrelevant.

    >In the same way, bhikkhus, an unlearned ordinary person, when struck by unpleasant feeling, sorrows, wails, laments, beats their breast and becomes muddled. They feel two feelings: one bodily and one pertaining to the *citta*.

    >Struck by that same unpleasant feeling, they resist it. Thus, the underlying tendency to resistance against unpleasant feeling underlies them.

    >Struck by unpleasant feeling, they delight in the pleasure of sensuality. Why is that? Because, bhikkhus, an unlearned ordinary person doesn’t understand any escape from unpleasant feeling apart from the pleasure of sensuality. Since they delight in the pleasure of sensuality, the underlying tendency to passion for pleasant feeling underlies them.

    —SN 36.6

    You can overcome this tendency for self-harm by "managing" it (e.g., psychotherapy and so on), but what will actually destroy it at its root it is to train yourself in the precepts and restraining all the *other* unwholesome actions by body and speech rooted in seeking that same kind of escape (and which a mental health professional wouldn't normally regard as a problem even though they're perpetuating the exact same "illness").

### What is wakefulness ?

Often in sutta we encounter the adjective "wakeful" and I wondered how we should understand it since sampajanna covers awareness (reflexive attitude) and sati recollectedness ? Is it an incentive to not be lethargic or to not oversleep or is it pointing at a deeper meaning. ?

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1d473w0/what_is_wakefulness/l6favr6/)** _2024-05-31 03:15:14_:

    The Pāli word being translated as "wakefulness" is *jāgariya,* and it doesn't just mean being awake but also being vigilant or on guard.

    So yes, not being lethargic and lazy (which is an optional mental choice no matter how physically tired you are) would be part of it, but it also means not neglecting the task of keeping your mind free of unwholesome states in general. Unwholesome states never exist on their own or by accident; they can arise only when they're allowed to pass through the gateway of volition (i.e., welcoming and entertaining arisen inclinations) and thus one should remain guarding that gateway vigilantly day and night.

### The Digha difference 

Been spending some time in the Digha recently and besides the obvious difference in length I’ve noticed a few other things. How are the descriptions of previous Buddhas and the markings of a Buddha significant in realizing right view? We don’t seem to touch upon these things in the Hillside community or very rarely. 

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1d3fky3/the_digha_difference/l6gtvu0/)** _2024-05-31 12:28:04_:

    It's not that those parts are significant in realizing right view, but that being able to fit those paradigms that already existed in society probably was probably useful in getting a lot of people to pay more attention to the message.

    Now, that's not on the same level as when the Suttas talk about rebirth, recollecting one's own past lives, and the existence of beings in other realms. It's not necessary to place emphasis on that in the beginning to gain the right view, but it cannot be dismissed as mere literary embellishment.

### Question : Unyoked from biology

I have a question about Bhikkhu Anigha's latest post titled "Unyoked from biology" on the HH website. 

Venerable Anigha, would you mind explaining in other words or in more detail the part where you say that seeing rebirth is about discerning that our choices are not the same as the body? Isn't this capacity to choose the same as the aggregate of Sankhara? 

Even though we experience it (citta/sankhara) as being separate from things appearing or manifesting, how can we be so sure it must predate this body? Maybe both are possible? It appeared in this life but we are not fettered by it for as long as we live? 

Also looking at the citta in this way, doesn't it sound like it is that citta that "roams around and experiences the result of good and bad actions"? Precisely what the Bhikkhu Sati believed? Just replacing the word consciousness with citta? Citta is often used as a synonym for consciousness in many modern theravada circles.

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1d3dk4i/question_unyoked_from_biology/l6c5o9t/)** _2024-05-30 15:31:32_:

    >Isn't this capacity to choose the same as the aggregate of Sankhara?

    Yes and no. The citta is the reflexive or "second-order" aspect of experience. It's the perceptions in regard to what is perceived, the feeling in regard to what is felt ([of which there is always only one at any given time](https://suttacentral.net/mn74/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin)), intentions in regard to intentions—and of course a second layer of consciousness that cognizes this second layer of *nāmarūpa*. But the essay focuses on the aspect of intentions which is arguably the most central.

    To illustrate with a very crude example, a mug arises on its own as either "for drinking" or "for storing pens", and these are first-order saṅkhāras. The second-order saṅkhāra there would be the intentional choice to use the up for one purpose and not the other. And it's on that first layer that you find what I refer to throughout the essay as "biological drives" (the intention of "for eating" in relation to food arises more strongly the hungrier you are). But no amount of intentions in the first layer can induce an act of volition, which is the domain of the citta and where individual responsibility lies.

    >Even though we experience it (citta/sankhara) as being separate from things appearing or manifesting, how can we be so sure it must predate this body? Maybe both are possible? It appeared in this life but we are not fettered by it for as long as we live?

    It wasn't stated that the citta "predates" the body, since that would assume it to be a positive entity that can stand on its own independently of experiences, which the Suttas [repeatedly state is a wrong view](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn38#mn38:7.3-mn38:8.7) (a similar statement but with the feeling aspect of the citta appears in MN 146). The point is that the citta/consciousness cannot have had its first point at the moment of *conception* (or, even more nonsensically, at some specific instant where the brain became sufficiently developed), which might sound the same but isn't.

    The reason for that is that the conception and growth of an embryo are physical processes, and if we have accepted that the mind is not material/solely produced by matter (which we cannot coherently deny if we regard choice and action as real, as explained in the essay), there would be a contradiction. It would imply that "something else" unrelated to the physical developmental process played a part in the manifestation of the citta (otherwise it would be fully material).

    Now, we are not intrinsically forced into one possibility of what that "something else" is—one could assume it to be God or some cosmic force. But that would mean that we're not responsible for the state of our citta, that something or somebody else made it as it is. So if we assume that we *are* responsible for our ignorance and craving and thus are able to liberate ourselves through our own effort, the only logical conclusion is that we'd been making choices before our conception too.

    Of course, if someone is not already inclined to accept certain premises, they'd still be able to reject the whole argument, which is why it's not a "proof" of rebirth. But it does show why both the validity of action and the possibility of "another world" are part of the mundane right view. They're not culturally conditioned ideas that occur together by mere chance.

### Sense restraint, how hard to push, what about when I mess up?

Lately my Buddhist practice has evolved from very meditation-centric, to now including other aspects of the path. For example, I have been practicing more generosity, kindness, metta, dhana at the monestary, and... sense restraint. I find that I'm very critical of myself when it comes to practicing sense restraint, because in my way of thinking, it's a practice of NOT doing certain things. Whereas, metta, dhana, being kind to others and that sort of thing is a practice of remembering to do things, and even if I just do a little bit I reflect on the goodness of it and that makes me feel good. 
But when it comes to sense restraint, I feel like I'm constantly second guessing my resolve. I determine to refrain from things, the pressure of boredom or craving gets too strong to bare, and I give in sometimes. Then I feel pretty terrible. I feel like I'm now caught in a pattern similar to addiction, and I don't think my approach has been very healthy or helpful to me. Can someone please take the time to explain to me an example of a gradual training in sense restraint? 

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1d32drw/sense_restraint_how_hard_to_push_what_about_when/l64x7pj/)** _2024-05-29 05:39:53_:

    Unless you see no further work to do in regard to the 8 precepts, you shouldn't be worrying about sense restraint to begin with:

    >*When the bhikkhu is virtuous*, the Realized One guides him further: ‘Come, bhikkhu, guard your sense doors.

    If that's covered, then you want to realize that beating yourself up is itself a failure in sense restraint (grasping at signs and features that induce states of longing and upset), and also recognize that by the time you end up with an intense pressure to do something unwholesome, you have already been failing to guard your senses properly for a good while, probably by doing things and dwelling on thoughts that you take for granted as justified or appropriate. The pressure never builds up in one instant.

    These two talks might be useful: [Why you keep losing sense restraint?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdYTDYZv7kw&pp=ygUldW5sYXBzaW5nIG9mIHNlbnNlIHJlc3RyYWludCBoaWxsc2lkZQ%3D%3D), [The Unlapsing of Your Self Restraint](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZ0JKWqRTho&pp=ygUldW5sYXBzaW5nIG9mIHNlbnNlIHJlc3RyYWludCBoaWxsc2lkZQ%3D%3D).

### How to contemplate dullness and drowsiness without falling sleep

Compared to the other four hindrances, I'm having hard time with drowsiness. I'm talking in general, not just in the context of sitting meditation, which I do with opened eyes.

Ven. Anigha put it simple what we should do

>"Knowing it" means you are aware of it's presence to the extent that neither succumb to it, nor do you overshoot it and act as if you're entitled to control the arising of pressure (SN 1.1)

With the other four hindrances, or other obstacles like self-identity, once I've identified them, it follows the realization of "such thing is not mine, not my doing, etc" (without having to think about it). Most of the times that's enough to not get dragged further. I keep contemplating the mind, and the hindrances tend to cease quite fast. If they persist long, I work as suggested in MN 20 until they are gone.

With drowsiness... I know it, yet I am likely to succumb to it. The MN 20 approach doesn't help me that much. Unless other hindrances, trying to trace back its origin gives me little insight - apart from the fact I'm lacking of energy, determination, and maybe faith with the practice. Most of the times I am not able to arouse the energy to get out of drowsiness, or if I do, it's only temporally, and after some minutes drowsiness came back stronger. Sometimes I try to contemplate the fact of dead, the fact that this change of being human and in touch with the dhamma is so rare, to develop a sense of urgency to get out of samsara... but they tend to become just a dull contemplation and I keep being dragged by drowsiness.

So, eventually I jump into the methods suggested in AN 7.61. The mechanical advice of taking a nap or washing the face with cold water and then walk for twenty minutes are the only solutions that work in most occasions - cutting the dullness for some hours. Yet, this falls into the "management" method.

Any suggestion to address this topic? I have read quite a bunch of material on this hindrance, but nothing that worked.

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1d2dsrn/how_to_contemplate_dullness_and_drowsiness/l64uudh/)** _2024-05-29 05:15:24_:

    >I keep contemplating the mind, and **the hindrances tend to cease quite fast.** If they persist long, I work as suggested in MN 20 until they are gone.

    This suggests that you're still operating under a misunderstanding of what the hindrances are. They are not specific objects that "cease" in that straightforward manner. As others have pointed out, that's management of sense objects, not uprooting of hindrances.

    >And what is the fuel for the arising of unarisen indolence-and-lethargy, or for the increase and growth of arisen indolence-and-lethargy? There is discontent, tiredness, yawning, sleepiness after eating, and mental sluggishness. Frequent attention not through the origin (*ayoniso manasikāra)* **in relation to that** is the fuel for the arising of unarisen indolence-and-lethargy, or for the increase and growth of arisen indolence-and-lethargy.

    —SN 46.51

    What this is saying is that the drowsiness itself is not the hindrance; it's your lack of perspective in regard to it that is. So what you need to do is stop indulging in the sleepiness without then wanting to not be sleepy, which is the opposite extreme. You do that by maintaining a simultaneous perspective of a subtler aspect of your present experience while the sleepiness is there, such as your bodily posture or the unpleasant feeling that's present (4 satipaṭṭhānas). And you sustain that perspective only to the extent that you don't get absorbed in the sleepiness, not more than that, and you certainly don't cultivate an expectation for it to ever go away. 

    The steadier you are in that perspective, the less the drowsiness will be problem or a hindrance, and the more the mind will be dispassionate and at ease within the same situation.

    And it's the same principle for all the other hindrances, which means you weren't really abandoning them. You were just suppressing that which *triggers* the hindrances, and now you encountered the one trigger that's not in your control.

### The dangers and compromises of the crowded and dusty household life

Greetings,

I’m an engaged father existentially torn by the compromise that I’m accepting by choosing a busy householder lifestyle.

What follows is a narration of the events from the last few years that lead to this situation, accompanied by some considerations and questions.

I would be very interested in reading the perspectives and advice of this community, both on my personal situation and on the general topic of practice and close family relationships.  
Discussing personal circumstances and choices of a stranger on the internet could be perceived as a delicate matter so I would like to give green light to frank or even stern comments, if deemed helpful. I assume the responsibility for receiving the feedback skillfully.  
Before getting to the story, I would also like to express my gratitude to all the contributors of this supportive and insightful community.

**A short history of the last few years**

I'm 33, European living abroad in another European country, in an intimate relationship, father of a 2,5 years old boy. My journey with Buddhism started in 2016 in a period of existential crisis, depression and anxiety with the books of Ajahn Sumedho. Buddhism played a central role in helping me recover my mental health. Not so much through meditation but by showing me that the anguish over the fundamental lack of control on my health, mind and ultimately life was not the sign of a pathology but the natural consequence of starting to see life as rooted in apprehension and ignorance. Easier said than done though, I had to spiral down all the way to the bottom, my attempts at management and control of the mental space swept away, so that I had no choice but to face the extent of my vulnerability and ignorance. That forced surrender might have felt like dying but life went on. I slowly came out of that dark period with increased confidence and I gradually nurtured enough energy and courage to leave my country and to travel in order to "find myself” and to find a place where to settle and start a new life.

I landed in my current country at the end of 2019 and just three weeks later I met the woman that is to this day my partner. On October 2021 she gave birth to our son. With the demands of having and raising a child together our relationship was put to a test. Our true characters and entrenched views and values emerged. On my side Buddhism started to re-emerge and worldly engagement to diminish. On my partner side the physical exhaustion and a rough return to work solidified a situation of depression. As a couple we lacked the common ground and communication skills to navigate the tough situation we found ourselves in. We were swamped.

**Notable recent events**

The crisis lasted for months and reached a turning point last November, when we decided to take a one-week break. After that we resumed with renewed energy and commitment to try better. The first half of December was a period of cautious optimism after two years of struggle.

In the second half of December I spent one week in a sort of retreat as a lay supporter: one monk (currently residing in Samanadīpa) spent two months in a winter refuge supported by a rotation of 2 to 5 lay people. This event turned out to be unexpectedly impactful on me. The monk shared with me his monastic experience and the transition toward HH/Samanadīpa. I recall telling him that a few months earlier I came across a video from Ñāṇamoli and proceeded to read a bit of his latest book. While I was intrigued by the clarity and power of his exposition I put it down because it sounded too self-assured, a level of confidence that I was not used to within Buddhist contexts. I assumed that something had to be off considering that the most respected monks of the Forest Tradition of Ajahn Chah were all adopting a more cautious approach. The monk suggested me to consider giving it a second try, all while maintaining my alertness and critical sense.

In a table in the corner of the main room there was a printed copy of the essay from Venerable Anīgha "[Sīla is samādhi](https://www.hillsidehermitage.org/sila-is-samadhi/)". To call it eye-opening is an understatement. I felt like I found the answers to the deepest questions I had about Buddhism and meditation since the beginning of my search. I felt an intense trust in the concepts and the practice explained in the essay, I could not detect any "red flags" or weak points to anchor my general tendency to skepticism. I use the word *feeling* since *understanding* as a puthujjana is an elusive concept. This said I knew in which direction to strive after coming home from the retreat: first, with new-found clarity on the role of virtue, examining and improving my conduct with regard to precepts. Parallel to this, investigating further the teachings of Ñāṇamoli, Anīgha and the other Hillside Hermitage monks.  
Along with this, with time for reflection during the retreat, it became clear to me that the option of a second child was off the table.

But...Samsara stroke back and just a week after my return we found out that my partner was pregnant. The result of recklessness in that short peaceful period at the beginning of the month. We had multiple factors pointing to a very low risk of pregnancy (also based on the experience with the first one). Yet low is not zero.

This said it would be simplistic to consider it just recklessness, we both had a shared nebulous aspiration to have a second child and the awareness that the biological clock was running. Considering the already difficult situation we had we knew that it would have been extremely distressing for everyone involved for a few years. But we also imagined it to be a preferable long term scenario for the kids to have siblings, and for the family to be bigger, especially in case the parents would separate. If this doesn’t make full sense it’s because these were instinctual considerations for the most part.  
Not taking precautions was a sort of semi-conscious yet intentional distraction from the burden of a choice with complex implications. Eluding the responsibility of choosing between actively trying to have children or carefully refraining from risking. During the retreat I had some space to listen to myself, to see this dynamic from a distance and to resolve to put a stop to it. But it was already too late. Few things in life remind us of the extent to which we are heirs to our actions as sex. A few minutes of pleasure leading to a new life coming to this world and multiple lives getting further entangled in the wheel.

The first trimester of pregnancy was, as it’s often the case, very hectic. For my partner nausea and emotional ups and downs. As for me, I was determined in pushing us to face our relationship issues and at the same time I was restraining sex as much as I could, and similarly reducing my social life, entertainment and distractions. It sounds like the recipe for a (mundane) disaster, and indeed it was. With the increased pressure the relationship with my partner steadily deteriorated. At the end of March we broke up, with the awareness that it would only be a partial and ambiguous separation due to the children.

During this phase I was reading Ñāṇamoli books, most of the essays and many threads in here, the Youtube videos became a daily Dhamma talk, and I got much pondering on sensuality, relationships, sex and how to conduct myself as a partner and father. The struggles I was facing were actually confirming the validity of the practice, as I could see that all the worldly pressure that we were experiencing could not be solved by worldly solutions or meditation. Those domains could either temporarily mitigate the suffering or suggest a new arrangement with slightly less suffering. Projecting this over the years or the decades I found it unsatisfying, simply put I couldn't believe in this approach.  
Other insights came from the stricter virtue that I was upholding and that heralded a crisis of sex. With the crisis of sex the myth of romantic love showed all of its fragility. Without the cover-up of unrestrained sensuality the problems could press with all their weight and could hardly be avoided. We realized how different our values and aspirations had become and our hope for a future together reached its minimum point.

Going to back to the break-up and its fuzzy nature. On one hand it's very easy for it to be just a nominal thing, since we are committed to being parents together and with physical proximity and the fluctuation of feelings, we are basically guaranteed to "fall" again for each other (as it’s been partially happening in the last days). On the other hand after two months of break, despite the stronger cravings for sensuality and the intoxication that accompanies them, I’m stable in the conviction that, as far as the two of us are concerned, we would be better off separating our lives completely. She could find a more aligned partner. I could pursue a lifestyle more suitable to training.

**The predicament**

The matter of fact is that as there are father and mother, there are son and (in three months) daughter. The bonds and needs of these four people become stronger and more complex than those of just a man and a woman. Juggling such a situation is already challenging in a conventional scenario, stark differences in values and desired lifestyle among the partners make it prohibitively hard. This is the crux of my conundrum. Not that it is unique to me, it’s actually a common situation that millions have faced before and that millions face today. The romantic relationship becomes the easy part to figure out compared to the implications on two human beings that are not self sufficient. All of this distress and struggle ultimately coming from ignorance and liability to the craving for procreation.

If I were to ask for advice for my predicament, the most simple way to phrase it would be: "what should I do?" To which the clean, unadulterated, answer seems to me to be: give all you have to your family, leave everything and go forth. Or at the very least sculpt a lifestyle that would allow to live as similarly to a renunciate as possible. If one could commit to that decision with unremitting determination, that would be it, given that the kids and the mother will not risk their lives.

I can see a few problems with that. First of all I would not do that *fully* for the right reasons. More or less consciously there would be the intention to dodge the burden of responsibility and of the many duties. In my puthujjana view that would make the action unwholesome, rooted in the desire to not reap the fruits of my unwholesome actions. On top of that I don’t see myself as able to sustain a fully renunciate lifestyle while enduring the sting of remorse for abandoning my family. I can see that avoiding remorse remorse is not a good reason to choose the householder life. I decide it to be such out of aversion for the displeasure of remorse and the pressure of societal norms and morality. Yet I can’t deny the right-in-front-of-me reality of this suffering, I can’t reason it away and I think that I wouldn't be able to endure it in the long term.

>I would phrase my question like this: what is the best among the inferior alternatives that one has to choose from when deciding to remain a father householder? How to minimize suffering for the all parts involved considering the limitations in my virtue, wisdom or faith in the Dhamma?

You can stop reading here if you want, this is already quite long. Below are some notes of mine, attempts at tackling the thorny situation. Plus a couple of very recent developments.

**Some considerations that I made in the past weeks**

These are more explorations of different scenarios, to investigate my inclination and reactions, rather than thought-out solutions.

I don’t have much doubt regarding the first months of the newborn, I’ll be there and do my part. The doubts arise when thinking about the vague "mid-long term”.

I could try to keep a clear distance, be available when needed, but not on a daily basis as an "engaged" father. Or having a schedule with days for family and days for seclusion. Is that sustainable? Is it imaginable that my partner would accept to carry this uneven burden? If I saw them struggling and I had the desire to help more, should I refrain from doing so?

As a more extreme variation of the above I could move away from family, keep sustaining them financially and only occasionally visit them, provided that my partner would be willing to see me. This seems just a strictly worse alternative to becoming an anagarika, as I would keep the family/relationship door half-open while not taking steps toward the renunciate life.

I could commit to continue as a father until the newborn is past the critical phase of the first 1-2 years and then detach. But commitments for the future don't truly exist, you can only commit in the present. In the future it will be a new decision. And likely not any easier than now. Is there truly a better moment for kids to lose the constant presence of the father? These are for the most part mundane considerations that would in any case openly oppose the idea of the father disengaging from the life of their children.

The only option that I see having the potential to support my practice goes in the opposite direction of what I mentioned so far.  
Since I have a good amount of savings I could provide for myself and my family (my partner is also earning a solid salary) for quite some time without working. I could resign from work and dedicate my time to either practice or family. If I can't fully choose between family and practice, I can then choose to not pursue other things outside of these two. This could help in a few ways:

* more time, of course. Although it’s all to be seen whether I will manage to spend this time wisely.
* pressure on myself, financial and societal.

I’ve always been a conscientious person, saving, restraining my expenses in gratification and status. The main reason for this was the famous safety net, preparing for the worst, but also giving myself more options for future decisions, without having money as a constraint. The flip side of this is that it favors an orientation toward the future and attachment toward savings, nurturing a misplaced sense of safety. Seeing the finances that I accumulated going down will induce stress and anxiety, possibly a good subject of contemplation.

When it comes to work, my conditioning and the societal consensus would agree that not to work is reproachable, a choice that denotes a lazy or immature person. In the case of a man or a father it would acquire an even stronger connotation, of failure, of going against the way things are, including the word of the Christian god that still influences us all. Going against this particular grain of the world would be a remarkable source of pressure and as such a further dimension of training.

* pressure on the couple: this is quite evident. If sex is one of the pillars of worldly love, a mutually advantageous financial and status arrangement is another. Many women don’t need a man to earn as much as possible in absolute terms, but they would definitely want for their man to earn as much as *he can* without sacrificing family. I’m not judging here, but money plays an important role in the level of reassurance and trust that most women feels towards men, thus leading to attraction and attachment. Willingly renouncing a salary is throwing a wrench into the mundane happiness and stability of a couple, possibly even more than abstaining from sex. Another source of pressure, one that could accelerate the couple toward its destiny. Another subject for contemplation.

What is clear to me is that regardless of how the specific family/relationship situation will look like, I should make the establishment of the Eight Precepts my main aspiration in the practice. More on this in a minute.

**Latest developments**

I wrote the first draft of this post few weeks ago. In the meantime two things happened:

* I had a couple of conversations with my partner. I made it clear that I don’t want to "get back together” as a "traditional couple”. At the same time I’m of the opinion that if sex is in the picture, then it doesn’t really matter how you call the relationship. We both know that we are in a partnership for the kids. From my side it feels like a tender friendship that becomes unstable and unclear in its nature due to the pull of sexuality. It’s surprising how little remains about romantic love once you imagine to remove sex from the picture. Striving toward and sustaining celibacy is going to be a hard endeavor for me, but I see that as a necessity if I want to make progress.

>Celibacy seems unattainable with the current situation and my level of development. At the same time I can’t accept not striving toward it. How to approach this situation? Any insight on this subject is particularly welcome.

* Just few days ago we signed a rental agreement for a house in the suburbs, a much calmer area compared to the city. The kids needed a bigger place, this has to be done regardless. But the practical implication is that I go back to fully living with my partner and I can only assume that this will bring complications alongside the practical advantages. The upside is that the new environment is quieter, slower and less proliferated in sensuality compared to the city.

It’s time to put down the pencil, one last comment connecting with the initial paragraph: I would not share such a personal and sensitive topic in 99% of communities, including Buddhist ones. I would be basically assured to come across as either socially maladjusted or thoroughly misled on what the Buddha said ("you are a lay person so feel free to enjoy responsible sex with your partner”). Yet even in this community I got to see that the topic of family and detachment remains a delicate one. I appreciate the different perspectives on the subject. And once again I would like to clear the way for forthright comments if any comes to mind.

Thank you for your attention and insights, may you all progress steadily in the Path.

    What's most important is that you hammer in—not only once, but on a daily basis—the recognition that every bit of effort you may put into these worldly affairs is effort that you're not putting into the Dhamma (the Dhamma that truly matters: "the relinquishment of all appropriations, dispassion, cessation, Nibbāna"). The worst possible outcome of all would be if you allow yourself to ignore that and think you're developing both opposite goals at once, which is what most "practicing" lay Buddhists do so as to get an easy way out of the mental dissonance that would be otherwise (rightly) be there. Naturally, that is the least *unpleasant* outcome, but how things make us feel is by no means a criterion for their rightness.

    The Buddha did not regard it as automatically wrong for a father to abandon his children ([Ud 1.8](https://suttacentral.net/ud1.8/en/anandajoti?lang=en&reference=none&highlight=false)), and he himself did so when he went forth. That's not to say that doing so is inherently skillful, of course. If you try to cover up the burden of guilt, and there is that sense of *escaping* from your responsibility, then it will be an unwholesome decision. If leaving it all behind feels like a *relief* rather than the taking on of a much greater burden, then that's a red flag (though not necessarily any worse than continuing to nurture passion and lust that will be even harder to undo later, so that still doesn't mean it's better to stay).

    The points made [in this video ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGsEduacoGo)apply almost verbatim to this scenario too (and perhaps it's useful to consider that, unlike parents, the Buddha never made wife and children a potential obstacle to ordination, even though the complaints and accusations leveled at the Saṅgha were surely not few).

    Now, if that's too much to handle for the time being, the next best thing (which would still be a compromise but not an insurmountable one) is to take on the 8 precepts as a layperson, and make sure that you don't make further decisions that will interfere with that or make it more difficult than it has to be. So, living together with your partner would be very ill-advised from that point of view, even if the intended purpose is to support the children.

    The least difficult thing to do in your situation that would still provide a [realistic opportunity](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn53) to gain the Right View would be to live apart from your children and provide financial support from afar, perhaps seeing them from time to time, but it's not a guarantee that split parenthood would result in a better situation for the kids in the emotional dimension than if you were not there at all. It can just result in more conflict and confusion, and on top of that you would hardly be anything but a bore for them to be with if you're committed to sense restraint.  It will also force you to keep working, which takes up a gigantic chunk of time that is, from the point of view of Dhamma, mostly going down the drain. So you would end up doing two things mediocrely instead of one of the two properly.

    In such situations it's almost always best to avoid proselytizing. A person can only heed admonition or advice if they're already willing to admit that they're making a mistake, and you can't ultimately force someone else into that admission. It has to come from their end.

    What you do have make sure, if you value the practice and developing your mind, is that you don't end up letting their behavior derail *your* determination to be virtuous, even if that ends up impairing the relationship.

    The issue might be that you're trying to understand and practice the Middle Way on the very acute level of thoughts without having sufficiently developed the necessary prerequisites. That's the main reason why people are not able to help but fall into either indulgence or denial in their attitude towards their experience even if they have all the right information.

    So the way to make sure that you don't end up with a coping mechanism would be to focus on whichever stage of the Gradual Training you haven't fully completed instead of directly trying to approach these much subtler aspects of freedom from craving, and just stop worrying about those for the time being.

    It's not uncommon for people to be virtuous, restrained, and withdrawn from unwholesome things *because* of their intense craving to become enlightened that they're hardly aware of (that's the driving force behind most of those temporary meditation retreats people do), and for as long as that *other* desire is what's keeping your actions in check, you won't actually be able to become enlightened (not in the way that matters at least). You need to get to the point where virtue and restraint have become your default *regardless* of your craving to understand the Dhamma in order for any attempts to see it to be fruitful.

    Then you will have a basis that is actually "clean", and it becomes a matter of dealing with the residues and subtler defilements, instead of your practice top-to-bottom still being driven by passion as it is for most people. That is why the training has to be step-by-step: each next step can only be properly developed once the previous one is effortless and doesn't require craving and ambition to sustain anymore. Each "layer" [becomes an "aggregate",](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn27#mn27:14.4) i.e. something that's been built up beforehand and is now there on its own.

### Mind is the maker of all things ?

After watching this [short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YndVvyOcymQ) about the first Dhammapada verse from HH, it got me wondering.

Indeed my whole experience, my whole world, is nested in the mind, requires the mind and is experienced through the mind. In this way we could say mind comes first. Yet, HH also insists (and this is also found everywhere in the suttas) on the fact that the body comes first, that we need to discern this right order.

Both assertions makes sense to me. I experience this whole world in my mind, thanks to my mind and I'm subjected to it. But my mind is seated in a body (the contained one) that I can only experience thanks to a body (the container one) which is already there and that I can only infer. So in that way, the body as a container/peripheral definitely comes first and the mind comes second, and the experience of the body that I am familiar with (the one I perceive thanks to my senses), occurs in truth solely in my mind. Would that be a correct understanding ?

In fewer words : 

"that body because of which" > Mind (mano/citta/6sb?) > the world and the perceived body

    >But my mind is seated in a body (the contained one) that I can only experience thanks to a body (the container one) which is already there and that I can only infer.

Would that be a correct understanding ?

    Not quite. Through this you would be conceiving "the body because of which", the one that doesn't appear to your senses, as something that exists independently "out there" (the assumption of the outside world that is inherent to self view). It does appear to your sixth sense, no matter how vaguely, otherwise you couldn't talk about it.

    Your mind is not "in" your body. Rather, the mind is that because of which you are able to hold any views, right or wrong, about where the mind is. It cannot be located in space.

    Ultimately, you cannot build a neat theoretical framework that establishes either of the two as more primordial (in which case you could take that one as self), and that's fine because that's never the purpose of the Dhamma, which is easy to overlook in the process of trying to understand it.

    The purpose of the Dhamma is to uproot passion and appropriation: if you incline towards taking your body as yours, you realize that it's impossible to have even the faintest recognition of that body if there were not a mind (that cannot be contained within it) allowing you to think about it. If you incline towards taking the mind as yours, you realize that without a body, there would be no mind. Even if that mind is not strictly "in" the body, it certainly cannot exist without it. Because, how would you be able to talk about "a mind" unless sights, sounds, smells, tastes, touches, and ideas are somehow involved? All of these, including ideas, are fundamentally bodily.

    See SN 12.62 and [SN 12.67](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=sn12.67).

### Withdrawal of Life Support equivalent to killing?

[deleted]

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1ckuulb/withdrawal_of_life_support_equivalent_to_killing/l2s4htk/)** _2024-05-06 03:15:10_:

    Sorry to hear about the situation.

    Yes. Although not as weighty as violent murder, of course, intentionally withdrawing life support would be killing. The bottom-line is that it's entirely unjustified to assume that a living being is in more pain when they're in a critical condition than when they're undergoing the final process of death. When the Buddha wanted to emphasize the severity of a certain feeling, he always used the expression "*dukkha* like that of dying".

    Even the most acutely painful *sensations* that you can conceivably experience with your still-functional nervous system cannot compare with the mental anguish of undergoing the actual breakup of the body and aggregates (which could last a long time). People who commit suicide invariably end up regretting it, because they realize death is not as quick and simple of an affair as they assumed it to be.

    So you absolutely never want your volition to be directly responsible for another living being having to undergo that experience sooner rather than later. But people, as usual, have a tendency to act out of how *they* feel on an immediate level on account of seeing their loved one in pain, and have a hard time enduring that and maintaining a broader perspective.

### MN20 and management

Hello,

are the 5 ways of making detrimental thoughts subsides presented in [MN20](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn20) considered 'management', or are they 'seeing and applying the middle way'?

Is 'management' as presented by HH only talking about management of perceptions, or is this type of 'mind inclinations/proliferation management' included in it?

&#x200B;

Edit: not sure why this HH picture is displayed here

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1ckqai5/mn20_and_management/l2s0qus/)** _2024-05-06 02:45:07_:

    Management is not solely determined by *what* you do but also by *how* and *why* you do it. Anything, even an attempt to "endure" instead of "manage", can become management based on one factor: are you trying to change what you're feeling?

    Being clear about when such an intention arises (which could be at any time, even though the contemplation has not changed) is how you would indirectly notice the tendency to "manage", not by simply asking yourself whether you're "managing" or not (because at first glance you will always think you aren't, so that's not a reliable criterion).

    The purpose of these five strategies is to help you abandon the thoughts (i.e., mental *actions*) that are rooted in craving in regard to what you feel and perceive, not to replace what you feel and perceive altogether. That's why after each instruction it says the mind becomes "settled, unified, and composed *internally"*, i.e., it has become dispassionate towards the *same* feelings and perceptions that it previously could not help but to take personally. The lack of disturbance didn't come from conjuring up different feelings and perceptions that you happen not to be bothered by (which would be management).

    And, again, that is why right development of mind *cannot* take place without unbroken virtue established beforehand. For a mind that cannot help but to act by body and speech when presented with acute pleasure and displeasure, the only way to be at peace is to not have that pleasure and displeasure arise *at all* anymore, so the underlying tendency for management (which will never be obvious to them; that's precisely why they remain a victim to it) would be inescapable, even if the person does their absolute best to adhere to all of what I just wrote.

### Jhana

Siddhartha prior to buddhahood trained all the way up to neither perception nor non perception. Still not being freed from suffering he went the way of the asetic. 
It's my understanding that to enter jhana one would have been freed from sensual desire since abandonment of sense desire and seclusion is what jhana is. If this is case, why did he go the asetic route if he had already surmounted sense desire? 
What am I missing here?

Grateful to anyone who takes the time to reply, and am very grateful for hermatige making the teachings public.

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1cirx6i/jhana/l2cqcjb/)** _2024-05-03 04:29:07_:

    >It's my understanding that to enter jhana one would have been freed from sensual desire since abandonment of sense desire and seclusion is what jhana is.

    You don't have to be permanently free from sensual desire in order to enter jhāna.

    The requirement is that the  perception of danger in sensuality [be solidified ](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an6.73)to the point where, *at that time* at least, your mind has no interest whatsoever in sensual pleasures of the past, present, or future ([while you're still perfectly aware of the five senses](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an9.42#an9.42:3.2-an9.42:4.2) and have not repressed your thinking; otherwise it doesn't count).

    >If this is case, why did he go the asetic route if he had already surmounted sense desire?

    Without wisdom and external instruction, if you didn't clearly understand how vital the bodily and mental withdrawal from sensuality was to get you to that point, you might not prioritize that sufficiently from then onwards, and might think that the "experience" of jhāna arose due to something else (and that could happen even if you've received instruction, let alone if you haven't). Hence you wouldn't get it again.

    Of course, he did eventually become an ascetic and even then he wasn't getting jhāna, and that's because external renunciation is only a prerequisite: the Middle Way is subtle and very easy to overlook; it's not as easy as focusing on an object or engaging in a repetitive contemplation until a pleasant sensation suddenly arises.

### Right Disgust - why disgust can be practiced directly as an antidote and Metta cannot?

While watching the recent [Right Disgust video ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqSaMcuy2kI) I couldn't help wondering why Ajahn recommends using Asubha as a direct practice to counter lust, but many times advised against treating Metta as anything other than lack of aversion (so something purely negative). 
Also, contrary to statements made in the video on Asubha being practiced concurrently with desire being present, Bhikkhu Anigha made the following point in "Pervading the World with Friendliness":

"The Buddha therefore instructs that one should practice mettā only after the mind is already not overcome by ill will."

It would be consistent to treat Metta the same way - as an antidote to Dosa, just as Asubha is practiced as an antidote to Lobha.


Edit: Also, in more practical terms - just like a specific perception was discussed to counter lust towards the food, what would be an analogous perception to counter aversion, eg to specific people?

Thank you.

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1ci0ap8/right_disgust_why_disgust_can_be_practiced/l27cvmg/)** _2024-05-02 05:10:50_:

    >It would be consistent to treat Metta the same way - as an antidote to Dosa, just as Asubha is practiced as an antidote to Lobha.

    At no point did he say nor imply that asubha is an "antidote". Throughout the video, he makes sure to emphasize that the perception of disgust must not be misconceived as a tool to get rid of the pressure and significance of the beautiful things, which is what we tend to call "replacing" or "antidoting".

    Mettā should be practiced in exactly the same way: you're not in any way trying to remove the unpleasant pressure of annoyance that has arisen in regard to someone—[that can go on forever ](https://youtu.be/sqSaMcuy2kI?si=-Ezk8eNybvCeVrLY&t=951)if it wants because it's not the issue. You simply maintain a context of non-hate *despite* that displeasure.

    In contrast to this, the typical way of practicing mettā goes overboard and tries make that displeasure disappear altogether (implying a wrong view that that's what ill will is), in the same way as asubha would be misused to *replace* the significance of beauty. That's what an "antidote" is, and it's not the Middle Way.

    >Bhikkhu Anigha made the following point in "Pervading the World with Friendliness":

    >"The Buddha therefore instructs that one should practice mettā only after the mind is already not overcome by ill will."

    See the line that comes right afterwards:

    >The mind first needs to be able to remain steady all by itself **when encountering things that challenge it**, instead of needing to use mettā or any other form of meditation as an aid to ameliorate such things.

    The point is exactly the same as the one made in the Right Disgust video. You need to be able to have the pressure present without your mind impulsively needing to *do* something about it right away, including "antidote" it (which is why the practice never starts with meditation, be it asubha or mettā, but with virtue and sense restraint; otherwise, everything you do will be superficial management). That's why I wrote "**not overcome** by ill will" and not "**free from** ill will".

    >Also, in more practical terms - just like a specific perception was discussed to counter lust towards the food, what would be an analogous perception to counter aversion, eg to specific people?

    Well, firstly the example of the food was figurative. It was said with reference to pleasant sense objects in general, not in the sense that you should literally imagine someone spat on your food in order to give up lust for it (that would become a quintessential form of misguided management, and soon enough would become ineffective).

    A perception that "counters" aversion could just be a simple recognition that not everything about the person your mind hates is bad. But, again,  the caveat is you must not be trying to override the pressure and annoyance that arose, thinking that mettā is about *liking* the person. It's not; it's about not hating people even when they cause you immense displeasure (inasmuch as asubha is not about hating pleasant things).

    And that's why *any* perception would indirectly develop mettā, such as the context of the body enduring behind that experience of anger, or even [taking the mood of anger itself as the context](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn10#mn10:34.4-mn10:34.5). Basically anything that prevents you from "taking up" the possibility of anger while it endures, even if its not the direct opposite of it (and the same applies with asubha). Otherwise, the Buddha would've said that you can only abandon lust and aversion by cultivating asubha and mettā respectively.

    Safety is found by making the mind completely immovable, not by dealing with the forces that attempt to move it.

### Additional Training Rules

Hi everyone,

About twelve years ago I experimented with the Bodhicari precepts of the Kendall Buddhist group. In essence, these were additional training rules meant to help deepen one’s practice. 

I have added some of these to the eight precepts and come up with the following fourteen precepts. (See below). 

My question is this: do you believe this will be helpful? 

Do you think it will actually be a hindrance?

1)Pāṇātipātā veramaṇī‧sikkhāpadaṃ samādiyāmi.
I undertake the precept to refrain from destroying living beings. 

2)Adinnādānā veramaṇī‧sikkhāpadaṃ samādiyāmi.
I undertake the precept to refrain from taking that which is not given. 

3)Abrahmacariyā veramaṇī‧sikkhāpadaṃ samādiyāmi.
I undertake the precept to refrain from sexual activity. 

4)Musāvādā veramaṇī‧sikkhāpadaṃ samādiyāmi.
I undertake the precept to refrain from false and incorrect speech. 

5)Pisuṇāvācā veramaṇī‧sikkhāpadaṃ samādiyāmiI undertake the Precept to refrain from backbiting. 

6)Pharusāyavācā veramaṇī‧sikkhāpadaṃ samādiyāmi. I undertake the Precept to refrain from using harsh or abusive speech. 

7)Samphappalāpā veramaṇī‧sikkhāpadaṃ samādiyāmi. I undertake the Precept to refrain from useless or meaningless conversation

8)Surā‧meraya‧majja‧pamādaṭṭhānā veramaṇī‧sikkhāpadaṃ samādiyāmi.
I undertake the precept to refrain from intoxicating drink and drug. 

9)Vikāla‧bhojanā veramaṇī‧sikkhāpadaṃ samādiyāmi.
I undertake the precept to refrain from eating at the wrong time. 

10)Nacca‧gīta‧vādita‧visūka‧dassana‧mālā‧gandha‧vilepana‧dhāraṇa‧maṇḍana‧vibhūsanaṭṭhānā veramaṇī‧sikkhāpadaṃ samādiyāmi. 
I undertake the precept to refrain from dancing, singing, music, going to see entertainments, wearing garlands, using perfumes, and beautifying the body with cosmetics.

11)Uccā‧sayana‧mahā‧sayanā veramaṇī‧sikkhāpadaṃ samādiyāmi
I undertake the precept to refrain from sitting or lying on high and luxurious seats and beds. 
12)Micchājīvā veramaṇī‧sikkhāpadaṃ samādiyāmiI undertake the Precept to refrain from wrong means of livelihood

13)Yāvajivam aham ratanattayam na niggahissāmi tatheva tam samādarena garukaram karissāmiti sikkhāpadaṃ samādiyāmi. I undertake the Precept not to revile the Three Treasures [the Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha] but to cherish and uphold them. 

14)Karunupāya kosalla pariggahitānam dasapāraminam paripurana sikkhāpadaṃ samādiyāmiI undertake the Precept to practise the Ten Perfections with compassion and skill. 

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1ch2tr3/additional_training_rules/l22csic/)** _2024-05-01 08:22:01_:

    The precepts on speech and livelihood should certainly be taken along with the standard 8 always. In particular, the abstinence from frivolous speech is one that deserves a lot of attention, since it's one that would train you to become very aware of the intentions behind your actions on the domain that's most proximate to the mind (speech) and is thus easier to overlook, while all the others apply to more obvious bodily intentions (or are easy to superficially emulate without any discernment of the underlying motivation, e.g., by always speaking with a tender tone, "non-violent communication", etc.).

    >14)Karunupāya kosalla pariggahitānam dasapāraminam paripurana sikkhāpadaṃ samādiyāmiI undertake the Precept to practise the Ten Perfections with compassion and skill.

    This one however should not be made into a "precept" as such, since the 10 perfections (if we just take each of them individually based on their connotations in the Suttas and not later traditions) are things that are entirely dependent on your discernment, and they cannot just be "performed" by anyone in a straightforward manner like the actual precepts can (not properly, at least). There's no rigid standard by which adherence to them can be judged, and that's why such things never come under the heading of virtue and precepts in the Suttas.

    Virtue is not about the things you *do*, but the things you *don't* do.

### What about the so called "arupa jhanas"?

I'm talking about the dimension of infinite consciousness, of nothingness, of neither perception nor not perception etc. What is HH stance on these things? I'm asking because it seems that these things are very important according to some suttas, and, at the same time, I personally wasn't able to find any talk about the "arupas".

I'm also wandering if they are connected with modern meditation techniques. For example, Ajahn Brahm teaches a kind of meditation where a practitioner loses the perception of the body, 5 senses (he excludes the 6 sense for some reason) etc., which sounds similar to the two latter "arupa jhanas".

Thanks.

    >I personally wasn't able to find any talk about the "arupas".

    There's a few talks that briefly touch upon the subject (such as [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdob2Ww6d-Y&list=PLUPMn2PfEqIwUiJG9Zy7S-89Twlw48qD1&index=18)), but it's not emphasized because for nearly all viewers it will only amount to abstract information that they're in no position yet to apply.

    >I'm also wandering if they are connected with modern meditation techniques. For example, Ajahn Brahm teaches a kind of meditation where a practitioner loses the perception of the body, 5 senses (he excludes the 6 sense for some reason) etc., which sounds similar to the two latter "arupa jhanas".

    Most definitely not. The ārupa attainments (they're not "jhānas") come about through developing the same principle as the 4 jhānas but on an even subtler plane (where, indeed, you wouldn't be perceiving objects of the five senses, but for the complete opposite reason of being "absorbed" or "concentrated"; instead, you *widened* your perspective and context way past that domain). Hence it's even more impossible for a person to attain any of those states "accidentally" or through a meditation technique, and they will remain completely out of reach just like the jhānas if one hasn't fulfilled the previous steps of the Gradual Training to a T. As shown by MN 106, it all invariably starts with the abandonment of sensuality and the world.

### Pabhasara Sutta

 [AN 1.51–60: Accharāsaṅghātavagga—Thanissaro Bhikkhu (suttacentral.net)](https://suttacentral.net/an1.51-60/en/thanissaro?lang=en&reference=none&highlight=false)   


" “Luminous, monks, is the mind. And it is defiled by incoming defilements. "

How much of this is to be understood as it says above? There are various discussions regarding this sutta and I'am curious to know how the Bhikkhu's of HH will interpret this sutta. 

Is the mind really Luminous originally or primordially? With right view and sila do we make it from Un-luminous to luminous again?

Or it's always been full of defilements and when we practice right view and sila we make it luminous as we go?

Would love to see how HH Bhikku's view this even if it's an explanation in brief.

&#x200B;

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1cf8619/pabhasara_sutta/l1qrzq6/)** _2024-04-29 04:36:41_:

    The most practical implication of this Sutta is that whatever practices revolve around "fabricating" wholesome states (as [mettā](https://www.hillsidehermitage.org/pervading-the-world-with-friendliness/) tends to be practiced) are inherently misguided. You would only do that if you don't understand that the wholesome states are being *obstructed* by the defilements (because you fundamentally don't understand what the defilements are) and all you need to do is uncover them by removing the defilements.

    Hence the same Sutta says:

    >The uninstructed ordinary person doesn’t discern that as it actually is present, which is why I tell you that—for the uninstructed ordinary person—**there is no development of the mind**.”

    It's like if there's some external dirt covering a light bulb and making it dimmer than it should be, and instead of just cleaning up the dirt, you try to turn up the voltage to make the light brighter. No matter how much you do that, it will never shine like a clean bulb would (with much less strain). And that's why there can be no right meditation without the right view.

    Now, that doesn't mean that we're "already enlightened" and so on. It takes years of thorough virtue, restraint, seclusion, and constant questioning and upgrading of one's views to recognize how to actually wipe the dirt off the light bulb (=become a sotāpanna), and there is no way to bypass those prerequisites.

    [This talk ](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=GWJHdJmjmhE)also addresses this Sutta.

### Wrong Speech and Therapy

Hi everyone,

I have been having disagreements with my wife for some time. During the course of the marriage we have had counseling separately and individually as well as having spoken to our friends about our issues. 

It now occurs to me that most of the talking in these settings were forms of grievance and expressions of resentment. It seems that talk therapy is uniquely conducive to speaking out of ignorance, desire and aversion. So much so that I am contemplating never participating in it again. It also seems to me that workshopping relationship problems with friends odd equally unskillful. 

My question is this: is there ever a time when one wouldn’t be engaging in wrong speech by speaking with a therapist or friend about one’s relationship problems?

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1cf5jne/wrong_speech_and_therapy/l1qv4av/)** _2024-04-29 05:06:13_:

    >is there ever a time when one wouldn’t be engaging in wrong speech by speaking with a therapist or friend about one’s relationship problems?

    It would depend on why you're trying to repair the relationship. If it's for some purely practical purpose, then you could regard the unwholesome states you're facing as not inevitable—as something that you could abandon internally while you still participate in the therapy.

    But if it's not out of practical considerations, and deep down you're doing it because you still want a good relationship with your wife ***as wife*** (at least emotionally), then there's nothing you can do internally to override the fact that you're *already* acting out of hindrances from the outset. The aversion and resentment you're experiencing are things that are already there, waiting to pounce, the very second pleasure of any kind becomes your motivation to act. That's one not-so-subtle form of ["Trojan horse".](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1cdklmr/comment/l1hyvqc/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

### 8 Precepts

Hello all,

I have been trying to perfect my practice of the eight precepts but I have some questions I would like to pose to the community. 

Due to my schedule it can be hard to get my eating in before solar noon. Provided I am limiting my eating to a certain time period (e.g. 11am to 7pm) would that be considered in keeping with the precept or should I train myself further until I can stop eating after noon?

In terms of deodorants and cologne, how strict should I be? I don’t want to come to work smelling badly but I kind of feel that I’m definitely not following the spirit of the precept. 

I have relatively little problem with the other precepts (although I have found myself singing along with my seven year old at times). 

I think I already know the answers to my questions but I would appreciate your comments. 

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1cecoat/8_precepts/l1hw6nz/)** _2024-04-27 13:16:15_:

    >Due to my schedule it can be hard to get my eating in before solar noon. Provided I am limiting my eating to a certain time period (e.g. 11am to 7pm) would that be considered in keeping with the precept or should I train myself further until I can stop eating after noon?

    The precept on not eating after noon is basically the only one that does not *necessarily* have to involve craving when you break it (quite a while certainly passed before the Buddha[ instituted that rule for the monks](https://suttacentral.net/mn70/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=main&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin); eating after noon is not one of the [things an Arahant is incapable of](https://suttacentral.net/an9.7/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=main&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin)). But practically speaking, for a mind that is not free from sensual craving, it will be much easier to practice moderation in eating (i.e. the right context of the mere intention to survive and stay healthy instead of enjoyment) if you limit your intake to one meal, or perhaps two, and within a certain period of the day. 

    If for practical reasons you can't accomplish that before noon, it's fine. It's not like 12p.m. is a magical number; it probably had more to do with how meals would be prepared at people's houses in ancient India, the lack of refrigerators, etc.

    As for deodorants, even of the scented kind if nothing else is available, I wouldn't consider that a breach of the 7th precept if the intention behind it is simply to not smell bad as opposed to smelling good. Same with laundry detergents and so on.

### Vitakkasaṇṭhānasutta

Hi everyone,

My apologies if this has been covered already but I’m unable to find it in the search. I am of the impression that Right Endurance/Effort means that we don’t reject by moving towards or away from sense contacts but an still unsure of how that fits in with the advice given in the Vitakkasaṇṭhānasutta. 

What is meant by the simile of the peg? Of crushing with awareness? How are these not managing pressure already arisen?

Thank you all in advance. 

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1cdklmr/vitakkasaṇṭhānasutta/l1gicvt/)** _2024-04-27 04:23:57_:

    >How are these not managing pressure already arisen?

    The main thing that must not be overlooked is the way that the Sutta starts:

    >“Bhikkhus, ***a bhikkhu committed to the higher mind*** should attend to five signs from time to time.

    The Buddha never told people to even attempt to practice the higher mind *before* they were established in the higher virtue, which is why all discourses on meditation the Buddha gave are addressed to monks, and a very scant few to *noble* lay disciples like Anāthapiṇḍika.

    Trying to purify unwholesome thoughts while there is still a willingness to break the 8 precepts is like meticulously guarding the gateway of a property that lacks an entire section of the surrounding fence. Even if your approach to guarding the gateway happens to be correct in its own right (i.e., you are not engaging in a meditation technique but are trying to follow what the Suttas say), the thieves already infiltrated the property a long time ago, and thus whatever you do at the gateway, no matter how skillful it is, is inevitably secondary and tangential (*i.e., management*).

    Or, to use [the Buddha's own simile](https://suttacentral.net/an3.101/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=main&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin), it's like putting gold ore—with stone, soil, gravel and all—directly into the crucible for melting, skipping the previous steps.

    You don't even need to have "plans" to break the precepts at any concrete point in time to have a defiled mind. Let's say you're too old to be interested in sensual pleasures so there's no real chance that you'd be seeking them: if you *could* be willing to engage if you were to suddenly regain your youth, that right there is the hindrance of sensual desire at full volume, so anything you do without addressing that (including the five strategies in this Sutta) is irrelevant to the root issue. It's an obvious indication that [the danger in sensuality has not been understood](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an6.73#an6.73:1.4-an6.73:1.5).

    So *that*'s the "thought of sensuality" that a person should be trying to get rid of first and foremost for all the rest to not be management. And you will know that you're actually "uprooting" instead of managing and covering up due to the uneasiness that would probably arise, and the fact that the mind does not want to even look in that direction.

### comment on nanavira and the relevance of 'flux' to the buddha's path

thank you to u/Additional_Fix8417 for your comments in another post and pointing me to the below link by nanavira:

[https://nanavira.org/index.php/letters/post-sotapatti/1964/119-l-06-4-march-1964](https://nanavira.org/index.php/letters/post-sotapatti/1964/119-l-06-4-march-1964)

in this letter, nanavira argues against the notion of 'flux' as being relevant to the buddha's teachings. he comments:

>Perhaps you will be wondering why it is that I am so anxious to destroy the notion of flux—or at least to eliminate it from the context of the Dhamma

the below is a critique of that letter.

in summary, i believe nanavira's analysis confuses the knowability of the external sense object (or as i suggest, it's unknowability), and over-states the permanence of physicality, mind, and mental concepts. he accordingly incorrectly concludes that the notion of continuous change (flux) is irrelevant to the dhamma.

i have written this critique as a direct response to nanavira - if anyone wishes to follow, i'd recommend they read his letter first, or at least read it in parallel to the below. 

-----

you take issue with the notion of flux. i note that you take physical objects as your initial point of analysis, and i suspect that part of your issue with 'flux' lies with this initial point of departure. if on the other hand, we take the mind as that initial point of departure, we see that flux (change) persists continually, constantly, ceaselessly.

indeed, the buddha himself recignised this when he commented that the mind is far more changeable than the material aspects of the body to the extent that if one were to take aspects of being to be oneself, it would be more sensible to take the physical rather than the mental as the physical has at least the appearance of endurance and persistence.

>*It would be better, bhikkhus, for the uninstructed worldling to take as self this body composed of the four great elements rather than the mind.*   
*For what reason? Because this body composed of the four great elements is seen standing for one year, for two years, for three, four, five, or ten years, for twenty, thirty, forty, or fifty years, for a hundred years, or even longer.*   
*But that which is called ‘mind’ and ‘mentality’ and ‘consciousness’ arises as one thing and ceases as another by day and by night.*   
*Just as a monkey roaming through a forest grabs hold of one branch, lets that go and grabs another, then lets that go and grabs still another, so too that which is called ‘mind’ and ‘mentality’ and ‘consciousness’ arises as one thing and ceases as another by day and by night.*

[https://suttacentral.net/sn12.61/en/bodhi](https://suttacentral.net/sn12.61/en/bodhi?lang=en&reference=none&highlight=false)

indeed, in light of the buddha's words above i do not think your charge of the inappropriateness of flux in the dhamma holds firm.

you state that the idea of continuous change is not a matter of direct observation, and yet, would not the buddha's teaching of insight in vipassana be the very essence of direct observation of change?

even at the most surface of levels with dependent origination in the context of the five aggregates, one can directly see the arising and passing away of mental phenomena: contact and consciousness of a sense object, perception, and intentional mental actions. indeed, there is no mental phenomena that remain or endures in one's experience. from this perspective, i think your charge that continuous change is not a matter of observation does not hold true either.

i see that the reason you come to this view is that your origin is consideration of external form. taking the most extreme example, a diamond could be gazed at for a person's entire lifetime and no change whatsoever be seen. in this context you are correct that human (natural eye) observation cannot encompass all the change of the universe.

however, when we address these ideas through the buddha's teachings, it becomes clear that constant flux is actually present - just perhaps not in the way you have considered it.

within the buddha's theory there is the external sense object. there is contact with the sense base. sense consciousness arises - knowing of the contact. sensation with hedonic tone arises; perception; mental intentional action. as a result of this, the physical form is conditionally impacted as well.

a concrete example - a person walks into our view: there is contact of the visual sight with the eye; eye consciousness arises, and we know we have seen something; sensation (pleasant if there is a pleasing aspect to the sight) arises and we perceive / know the object (as perhaps a well-loved friend), from which intentional mental action arises. this process in turn conditions the body - perhaps pupillary dilation, or heart rate increase.

this process is clearly one that is constant change. we know this from our daily experience that this kind of flux of mental and physical aggregates is immediate, constant, and unceasing. this is just as the buddha states in the quote above.

in contrast, you are focusing on the knowability of the external sense object. within he buddha's thesis, this, to some extent is illusory. i'm in agreement that we can't truly know the instantaneous changes that are taking place in an external object. indeed, even science can't know that due the delay between measurement and knowing of that measurement.

however, this isn't the buddha's concern.

your argument regarding the statement 'this has changed' as implying sameness (this) and not-sameness (has changed) is an argument of conventional language, not of absolute truth. certainly, even the buddha used 'i' to denote his existence in the past. conventionally, we are referring to a constancy of process of change, and not necessarily that something remains the same.

i find your analysis of external sense objects lacking in this regard. when you speak of 'this leaf' or 'this tree', or 'mango', you are referring to linguistic concepts. at the language level, a mango is not a 'mango' to a culture that has never encountered them - it may perhaps be considered an odd sort of peach, or say in some theoretical civilisation that has no fruit trees, a 'stone'. 'mango' is a cultural-linguistic concept, and not a truly existent thing. so much for language and the linguistic modifiers we use to signify or conceptualise phenomena.

you say "consider a leaf that changes colour—first it is green, then when it dies it becomes brown, but it is still the same leaf". is it though? in what way is there any permanence to that leaf over it's lifetime. just because there is a verbal signifier 'that leaf', in what way is there any sameness? you say sameness of shape  but actually there is no leaf that retains 'sameness of shape' at all (especially given their emergence from embryonic form of seed or bud). perhaps this is just a poor example you have chosen to make a point.

your example of the perception of a spoon is likewise troubled:

>I fix my attention on the bowl of the spoon and see the handle less distinctly out at one side; then I fix my attention on the handle and see the bowl less distinctly out at the other side. The spoon, as a whole, remains unchanged—in both cases it is exactly the same spoon.

you are confusing the external sense object and the internal perception of that sense object. the spoon itself is unknowable in the true sense - we can never know the true quality or nature of the spoon. our knowledge of it is necessarily mediated through our sense-base and mental aggregates, and our past experience with such 'spoons'. and these are, as noted above, in constant flux - one moment, we think we are looking at a spoon; then next we consider it's just a very detailed drawing of a spoon; then our perception shifts and we suddenly realise it's not a spoon at all but an adeptly placed small metal mug. this is the process of perception - constant flux and updating of information and perception. you can easily experience this in viewing illusory phenomena:

[old woman or young girl illusion](https://www.cleareyes.com/sites/cleareyes/files/styles/large/public/2020-12/hill_illusion%20sml2.jpg?itok=QMz5bSiH)

you say the general features of an object always remain the same, and yet i don't think you realise how much of this is made up by your brain. for example, are you aware that we all have a blind spot in our vision - a gaping hole in the centre of our foveal vision, which the brain, miraculously, mends together for us. likewise, consider the room you are in with it's four straight walls and 90 degree corners. you may be surprised to learn that likely none of those corners are presenting to your eye at 90 degrees. your brain is simply interpreting them as so.

my point is that there are no "constant sensible qualities" of an external object that are perceived - the brain makes up a large part of your experience; a spoon is not a spoon ...

from the point of view of the mental processing of the external world, then, yes, indeed, things are in constant flux. if they were invariably constant according to the external world, we would all likely go mad - nothing would be predictable and our understanding of the world would be wildly inaccurate.

further, "same" and "different" are always relative then. same and different qualities of sense objects are necessarily dependent on the sense-base perceiving them, and that sense base is in constant flux. the pupil size changes, the angle of the head changes, our perception and recollection of phenomena changes. we say 'same' but there is no absoluteness in that statement whatsoever. that's an entire deception created by the mind. hence we mistake seeing a stranger for a friend, and old woman for a young girl, etc.

your very example of the sudden perception that "the curtains have faded" is a very example of the mind ignoring salient information until it becomes too obvious to ignore. thus, our ability to perceive flux in an external sense object has nothing to do with the reality of what is occurring. further, within the mind, i reiterate that there is constant flux of the mental aggregates arising and passing away instantaneously.

>The contradiction \[involved in the definition of flux or continuous change\] arises from failure to see that change at any given level of generality must be discontinuous and absolute, and that there must be different levels of generality. When these are taken together, any desired approximation to "continuous change" can be obtained without contradiction

surely, the inability in daily life to retain a single state of consciousness of a sense object, or a feeling, or a single perception, or an intentional thought, unchanged and unaltered, for even a single minute, is ample evidence of the discontinuity and absolute incessant change occurring instant to instant.

for the buddha, this process (dependent origination) is incessant. within samsara, there is only the possibility of prolonging a particular perception in jhana, which can result in rebirth in the insensible formless realms where one maintains a single percept for a period of time, before that percept passes away too.

in this context, i cannot understand you argument against the idea of flux in dependent origination.

alternatively, from what you say, you seem to imply that your objection the the use of the word 'flux' is a linguistic one - the connotation of flux as denoting a smooth transition, rather than continuous change. if that is what you mean, i can accept that, but i'd note that that is simply your verbal lingustic (and western cultural) interpretation of language. it's not an absolute, and it's not a genuine basis for an argument in this context. language is a culturally negotiated set of conventions. you are applying a western interpretation of language to an eastern framework of thought. if this is the basis of your objection to 'flux', then simply define your terms and renegotiate those meanings in the face of this novel cultural contact.

the buddha circumvents this argument. he speaks to the arising and passing away of phenomena in a dependent fashion. a phenomenon (e.g., sense contact) arises to a peak and then passes away, then conditioning the arising of another phenomenon (e.g., consciousness) arising to a peak and then falling away, etc. there is conditionality, but each individual phenomena arising and passing away has no intrinsic essence - it's constantly (and you will dislike this word) in flux. this absence of essence at this level of arising and passing away is anatta.

you seem to consider the possibility of this way of thinking about phenomena here:

>Perhaps, then, we are wrong in thinking that 'a continuous succession of changes' is the same as 'continuous change'. If these two are not the same, and 'continuous change' is the truth, then we must deny the existence of separate individual changes

however, it seems you are unable to accept this, as you subsequently reify this change by analysing it in terms of sections of a whole, but then contradictorily, refusing to allow change as occurring within each of those sections. it seems to me that your natural bent is towards reification and this is preventing you from seeing anatta.

i note that your comment that states of mind "do not come within the sphere of science" is limited by the science of your time. in modern science, mental states are clearly the purview of research and empirical elucidation. you note that your original correspondent does not appear to accept flux in mental state. i'm not sure why they would think that if they were educated in the buddha's teachings (perhaps they were not). however, on the basis of the above, i cannot understand how you can state that "the notion of flux cannot be applied to states of mind".

accordingly, your argument of "familiar" sense objects falls down: nothing is truly ever familiar, but the brain - falsely - makes up that familiarity. if that were not true, then what happens to one's brain would never impact the familiarity of objects. that's not the case, as dementia for example, makes things entirely unfamiliar, though they do not objectively change.

>You say 'The word flux means continuous change. If this idea is applied to everything it would be correct to say that what I see now, e.g. a tree, is not the same as I continue to watch it as it is subject to continuous change'

i cannot see why you consider this to be false? why is is incorrect to state that there is no intrinsic essence to conditioned phenomena? you can certainly state that there is no intrinsic essence to the mental processing of external sense objects. if you are referring to the truth / reality of external sense objects, independent of mental processing, this is irrelevant to buddhism. perhaps you are fixated on the 'truth' of the verbal linguistic label. however, even at the cultural level, the notion of 'tree' breaks down when analysed.

your objection to this way of understanding the buddha's teaching is that "it does not explain why what is impermanent is suffering, and what is suffering is not self".

however, the answer to that is quite clear: greed aversion and delusion arise as a result of ignorance of the true nature of phenomena. our mistaken assumptions of the permanence of phenomena, of the capacity of phenomena to satisfy us, and of an intrinsic essence to phenomena, are all false, and this false assumption leads us, invariably, into reliance on a false understanding of the world, and naturally, suffering.

seeing impermanence (or flux) is the first step to understanding that these phenomena have no true essence, and hence are unreliable for our happiness. impermanence (or flux) are integral to the initial step of realising the truth of the buddha's path:

    How were you then able to write this, which certainly took more than a single "instant"?

### Facing boredom and not chase after pleasure

One of the biggest bound with sensuality I have to work on is my attitude when facing boredom. For as long as I can remember I've always tried to escape boredom with pleasurable and stimulating activities to the point where I developped an irrationnal fear of it.

For so long, I've even followed a process that will dictate what I will do most of my free time that can be summarized thus:

**If thinking about doing such and such activity**

* Doesn't provides me with pleasure at the prospect of doing it, I'm feeling an aversion for doing that activity as if it's going to be a chore and I will not do that to kill time
* However if it does provides me with pleasure at the prospect of doing it, I will probably dabble into that until it does not provides me with pleasure anymore (sooner or later in a matter of days/weeks)

Most of the time I will always need to have something to do on the side when I'm not busy, if I don't I will be restless, an unreasonable feeling of dread will take hold of me "I don't know what I'm going to do later, I need to find something quick", relentlessly reviewing past activities and new possible forms of activity until I find one that can provide me with pleasure.

*(Note that I don't have any difficulty regarding doing things that need to be done but which doesn't provide me with pleasure at the prospect of doing them, I'm only talking about the free time when duties and essentials basic tasks have been done)*

I think I've clearly adopted an attitude of aversion towards boredom and irrationnal addiction towards pleasure, and the fact that it has so much weight in my life and that it basically leads it is the sign that I need to get rid of it.

**So,** I really need ideas to start changing these habits otherwise I will just continue to repeat this never ending cycle, so I came to wonder: what do noble disciples free from sensuality do when they have free time? I believe they are probably not chasing pleasurable and stimulating activities in the way I'm doing it.

Should I just force myself to sit or go for very recurrent walks and dwell in non-activity most of my free time? Working to establish yoniso-manasikara and lessen appropriation of the aggregates; applying what Ajahn Nyanamoli teaches regarding becoming aware of craving in my experience and including my attitude in regard to it as being there because of craving; just dwelling in an untroubled state without forcing anything when feeling pleasant or on the contrary take advantages of these moments to question and review in what ways I could still be liable to craving and work on severing the resistance...

Surely I also could do activities related to the Dhamma, like studying suttas and books about Dhamma, at least when the prospect of doing it feels like a chore or neutral enough, and is not provoking delight so I know that is not going to be unwholesome activity disguised as wholesome.

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1c68si4/facing_boredom_and_not_chase_after_pleasure/l03k2sl/)** _2024-04-18 04:25:51_:

    You don't have to come up with a specific "plan" in order to not give in to the pressure of boredom (since that would become your giving in to it). All you have to do is make sure that *whatever* you do is still in accordance with the context of allowing the pressure to endure for as long as it wants, and that might very well vary from one day to the next. Only you can know when a particular action—externally wholesome as it may be, including contemplating the Dhamma—is or is not aimed at escape thing boredom (based on the inclinations of your mind *right now*, not some pre-defined guideline).

### Questions on suffering and views.

warm greetings all,  


**Q: Suffering arises as a result of our views on experience (the 6 senses)?**

Examples of what I mean by this: 

1. The view that these thoughts/feelings are mine. 
2. The assumption that I have to act on this idea from the mind.

If this is true, then by just being attentive/aware of what happens throughout the day \[with withdrawal from sensory engagement\], you can see what sort of habits/assumptions about the 6 senses you have. Then you can modify those assumptions (by no longer acting in that way). Is this correct? For example, I could have had the view that "this thought is horrible" and have aversion towards it. But then I change my view around it to "let me (openly) hear what this thought has to say", which removes the aversion around it.

  


What I don't understand is what makes wrong views like "externalism" or "materialism" so wrong. Those to me seem like philosophy (doesn't really affect my direct experience) vs what I described above is about reality (looking at your present experience). Why does it matter if someone thinks that "everything is molecules" if that same person corrects the way they regard experience in terms of their views on the 6 senses?

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1c59c1g/questions_on_suffering_and_views/kzxnksv/)** _2024-04-17 03:15:11_:

    >Suffering arises as a result of our views on experience (the 6 senses)?

    Yes, but the caveat is that those views that are the root of suffering are not deliberate. Starting from the point of view of ignorance, which we all do, it's utterly impossible to take a detached perspective from which you can see your own views and assumptions. The views and assumptions that cause suffering are there precisely because you are unable to see yourself having them. Otherwise, the Buddha's teaching—whose essence is in telling you that there *are* wrong assumptions no matter how sure you are that there aren't for as long as you're not at least a sotāpanna—would not be necessary.

    Therefore:

    >If this is true, then by just being attentive/aware of what happens throughout the day \[with withdrawal from sensory engagement\], you can see what sort of habits/assumptions about the 6 senses you have. Then you can modify those assumptions (by no longer acting in that way). Is this correct? 

    No, you would be practicing attentiveness/awareness *with* the wrong assumptions from start to finish, and anything that you're able to "catch" and then modify would be superficial and secondary.

    The wrong assumptions can only start to become apparent for what they really are over a prolonged period of time, as a result of gradually facing the discomfort that arises from no longer feeding the dependence on sensuality and emotional safety that one finds in the world. Only a stream-enterer or higher has understood the nature of assumption and freed themselves from it partially (but irreversibly). The understanding of the Four Noble Truths, which is what makes one a stream-enterer, is all about the recognition that *no amount* of unpleasant feeling—irrespective of its cause or characteristics, so not limited only to painful bodily sensations but including the deepest and most complex types of emotional upset and dissatisfaction—is in itself suffering\*,\* and it is rather craving alone that is responsible for suffering.

    And one also starts out not even seeing that craving for what it is, noticing at best its secondary byproducts like obvious lustful or angry thoughts, which can be very well be individually managed and suppressed for quick relief without putting a dent on the actual craving.

    >What I don't understand is what makes wrong views like "externalism" or "materialism" so wrong. Those to me seem like philosophy (doesn't really affect my direct experience) vs what I described above is about reality (looking at your present experience).

    Such standpoints of "philosophical" nature are also secondary results of the actual views and craving that are not even seen. That's why a person can perfectly align their standpoints with "Buddhist doctrine", rejecting both eternalism and materialism and embracing (what they think is) the Middle Way, and yet their underlying view would remain unchanged, shown by how they remain equally subject to suffering.

    >Why does it matter if someone thinks that "everything is molecules" if that same person corrects the way they regard experience in terms of their views on the 6 senses?

    It matters because if they had truly understood their six senses, they would realize that whether "everything is molecules" or not is totally besides the point, and thus they would simply stop thinking in those terms. They would realize that their idea of "everything is molecules" (or the opposite, that nothing is molecules) is and always will be fully enclosed within their six senses, and thus it cannot possibly be a statement about a supposed external reality "beyond" the 6 senses (which can only be conceived through a wrong assumption, never actually experienced).

    Thus, if they still adhere to that view or any other of that nature, it can only be because they remain ignorant of the nature of the six senses.

### Role of focus

Just looking for perspectives on this particular view of practice. As I understand, the only problem with contemporary practices is the notion of avoiding what is present in favor of fully indulging in one sense object.  However, if you can maintain awareness of the necessary overlying context, ie; body is the container, and you don't shift away from anything that arises, then there is no problem with stabilizing the mind on the sensation of breath, for instance.  It's actually better than letting it jump all over the place and cause trouble. 

Either way, the phenomena don't care about you, they will arise.  But in the 1st option, your underlying view is that they ARE yours since you don't have enough insight persisting.  With peripheral awareness, you have just made a simple discernment, and now that knowledge is included in this otherwise very similar experience.  You don't lose that knowledge unless you deliberately go and distract yourself from it.  But just sitting on the breath won't make established background knowledge fade away, and it also won't prevent other things from arising.  So the difference emerges in that arising, where the meditator with peripheral awareness feels no need to turn away from pain, towards pleasure, etc.  Or if they do, they know where that pressure comes from too. It takes YOU out of the sense objects, essentially.  But that doesnt mean that YOU shouldn't stabilize your mind... it's more peaceful, more wholesome than letting a monkey jump around and steal food from passers-by.  Even if you know it's not your monkey, everyone would be better off if that thing were tied down and given something of its own to nibble on. 

I ask this because I have seen videos where Ajahn seems to discourage this type of focusing, and on the other hand I've directly heard "yes, by all means focus on the breath if it keeps you from acting out of the hinderances"  in another video.  I just want to clarify this so I can put it to rest in my own practice, I'm sure that there is a subtle piece that I'm not appreciating that kind of unites both sides of the coin, or maybe I correctly identified that piece above.  Either way, I'm unsure. 

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1c3khnr/role_of_focus/kzimzir/)** _2024-04-14 11:10:42_:

    > the only problem with contemporary practices is the notion of avoiding what is present in favor of fully indulging in one sense object. 

    No, that's not the only problem with contemporary practices. Although it's less common, there are many teachers who *speak against* the intense concentration on one fixed object (a paradigm originating from the now mostly disregarded Visuddhimagga) and advocate a more "open awareness" style of practice instead, and that doesn't make their approaches right by any means.

    >then there is no problem with stabilizing the mind on the sensation of breath, for instance.

    Well, there is no problem with that *in itself* inasmuch as there is no problem with staring at a wall, sweeping leaves, or sewing. The problem is when there is a *view* that doing that in any way contributes to the cessation of craving any more than staring at a wall, etc. does (because those things also keep your mind from "jumping all over the place and causing trouble").

    While you're watching your breath (or anything else of that nature) and everything is seemingly clean and pure, passion, aversion, and distraction, and all the ignorance and wrong views are very much still there lurking, pulling the strings "from above". To use an analogy, all it really does is make the defilements operate at a lower frequency that the "ear" of an ordinary person no longer detects, and so it *seems* to them like they have a pure and unagitated mind at that time. To someone who's been sleeping on urine and excrement their whole life, even the dustiest of floors will seem clean.

    So instead of that, a person should make effort to see for themselves what exactly are the defilements, what is that "jumping around" of the mind really, instead of rashly assuming that it's as straightforward as the content of thoughts changing from one thing to the next—in which case a sniper whose mind does not waver from his intended target would have a mind that's not "causing trouble" at that time. Any sensible person knows that that's not the case, but they would not reflect deeper and realize that their meditation should revolve around stopping *that* kind of trouble on every level instead of just slowing the mind down, which is, as illustrated by the example, utterly unrelated to the problem. It's the basic error of mixing up correlation with causation: "whenever there's a lot of craving, my mind moves around a lot, and therefore the movement is the culprit".

    And getting to understand what craving actually is—which can only be done on the basis of steadfast virtue and restraint—will require lots of "movement" of the mind in the form of self-questioning, investigation, and reflection, and that is not a problem at all, because even the first jhāna *is* thinking-and-pondering, as the Suttas themselves say (although nowadays people like to insist that the Buddha used the term *vitakkavicāra* when he really meant something else).

    >I ask this because I have seen videos where Ajahn seems to discourage this type of focusing, and on the other hand I've directly heard "yes, by all means focus on the breath if it keeps you from acting out of the hinderances" in another video.

    You're probably referring to [this instance](https://youtu.be/-039SYi2a94?si=l2DSdYd7wN1sOejK&t=685). He said right afterward that the difference between attending to your breath rightly is and wrongly is whether you have the view that the *arising of the thought itself* is an issue, and you definitely would have that view if you are anchoring your mind in the *sensations* of your breathing, which is not Anapanasati at all. Having your attention on the level of sense objects, whether it's one fixed object or a range of constantly changing ones, inherently prevents you from having the type of perspective that can even recognize what the hindrances are, let alone overcome them. Again, at best it makes them operate at a lower frequency.

    [This talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwRqWW79kFg) goes into detail on abandoning the hindrances, and it's in those same terms that Anapanasati should be understood.

### Money, Material Safety and Dhamma

Do you think making money and following Dhamma are incompatible?

I know of the tenth precept as well as of Ajahn Chah emphasizing the fact that you can't want to follow the Dhamma and stay attached to your money (I'm paraphrasing).

I am asking because something like 1 year ago ago I started wanting to make money so as to be able to escape my current life and condition, but I quickly realized it wasn't going to happen or at least not very quickly, and it started making me quite miserable feeling so much delight at the idea of having much money so as to have that material safety and not have to restrict my wants and just escape the "rat race", but not being able to experience the target of that delight.

During this time I started investing my dormant savings here and there, and a few months later, because of that miserable feeling and the fact that I was questioning more and more the point of continuing that quite absurd meaningless life of commute, work and sleep, and also not being interested in the usual point of interests people are looking for in life so as to keep going (family, friends, career, the holy...), I was coming back to Buddhism stronger than ever because I was curious about the Buddha and his way of being able to be at peace without all these material considerations, and also because I felt a natural inclination towards the Buddhist spirituality for a long time.

Thanks to the Bhantes at Hillside Hermitage I feel like I learned a lot in the past few months about the Buddha teachings and also about "myself" and I was even surprised by how I was able to have more self control and to reduce my suffering in my daily life.

Until there I was letting my investments work without giving it much consideration, but recently my interest for it started rising again since it began to give me good results and also needed me to give it more attention so as to optimize the profits. But with it came back the lure of profit as well as the agitation, worry and the doubt, I realized I've been thinking almost exclusively about that in the previous weeks, the delight in the prospect of material safety came back even though I know it is quite pointless and will not be source of happiness/peace at the end of the day; and that my Dhamma practice have practically come to an halt, that I have even regressed on some points.

And so this led me to question whether these two aspects of my life could coexist, giving it all to search material safety on one hand (which has such a strong pull) and giving it all to search spiritual safety on the other hand, right now I feel like they are in complete contradiction and going toward one leads me further away from the other.

Not sure why I'm bringing this, I think I already know the answer to that question, maybe just to try and find some motivation and samvega, but I guess I would like to know how YOU are dealing with that, and also just address the topic on this sub and hear what you think about it

**Edit:**

**Materiel safety** is a bit too encompassing, I was mostly thinking about **monetary freedom**, being able to answer all monetary needs, for yourself and for your close ones, that kind of relative safety, also not needing to do alienating jobs wasting the time we have at our disposal but being free to live however you want and need (in the limits of the law)

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1c2a3r6/money_material_safety_and_dhamma/kzce3lw/)** _2024-04-13 05:04:46_:

    It seems like you're presenting it as an all-or-nothing when it shouldn't be. You can invest effort in taking care of your finances without it necessarily involving giving in to hindrances, but what *is* black-and-white is that, at least if you hope for significant achievements in the practice, satisfying your sensual desires and worldly ambitions must not be in the list of intended uses for the money you earn.

    If you set that up as a context and make effort in constantly recollecting it, the amount of concern and agitation that would arise would be severely limited, since fundamentally the cause of any hindrance is dependence on sense pleasure (i.e., the *why* of your attempt to earn money, not the attempt itself).

### Would that meditation practice be ok ?

After encountering HH I dropped my morning sitting practice to focus on sense restraint first. Since then sense restraint helped me tremendously to improve my outer and inner conduct. I can clearly experience the pressure on the senses when the mind is craving something. I can clearly see how it is indeed disagreeable when the mind doesn't get what it wants. At times I noticed too how this craving appears and just vanishes without having done anything to suppress it. As explained in this sub before, the restraining needed to be tighten at some point because things got easier and I was't feeling bothered anymore. This has been my experience. I'm nowhere perfect as I'm still struggling noticeably in the evening time to not indulge in watching TV shows or to browse the web.

So my question is  : Would it be ok now to start practicing again a sitting meditation in the morning knowing that this won't bring any kind of insights but it's just pleasant and healthy for the brain ? It might also helps in stopping the pattern of the mind which seeks instant gratification. My fear is that I don't want it to be a cheatcode making me  unable to feel the pressure/craving on the senses. I actually tried this morning. Inspired by a video from HH (the ultimate method for overcoming hindrances) it went like this : I brought up in the mind a thought of sensuality to see how the mind reacted and immediately desire arose. I did not indulge furthermore the thought but concluded this desire was not leading to detachment and I'm not free from sensuality. Did the same with the other hindrances. The problem is that at some point contemplating like this the mind got quieter and when I brought up those thoughts the mind was more or less unmoved and some pleasure arose. Because it felt useless and wrong at this point to bring up thought of hindrances I switched to knowing the breath. Just knowing that I was breathing in or out. If I got distracted I tried to identify if it was a thought of ill-will, agitation and so forth without totally forgetting the breath.

So is that totally wrong or is that ok to practice sitting mediation along those lines ?

&#x200B;

    >The problem is that at some point contemplating like this the mind got quieter and when I brought up those thoughts the mind was more or less unmoved and some pleasure arose.

    If you are asking this question (i.e., there was the possibility for doubt in your experience at that time), then it must have been because you didn't actually address the hindrances sufficiently. You have "addressed" the hindrances when there is no chance for even the greatest of your desires and the greatest of your fears to move you even as you're thinking about them. And you would never achieve that just by observing your breath in the way you're describing, which is more like getting occupied with something else altogether instead of [doing the work](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=XfnlunP24iI). 

    Instead of finding one nice, clean corner in a messy house that you can dwell peacefully in when you close your eyes and forget about the rest (which is what most meditation practices are about), it's about cleaning the whole house—*trying* to find dirt—so that eventually, no matter whether you walk, stand, sit, or lie down *anywhere* in that space, you will be at ease. Only the latter qualifies as right samādhi, and fosters the type of wisdom that matters.

### "One has to experience the pleasure of jhana before doing the sense restraint"

I've encountered this view i.e. that one has to achieve jhana before one can start abandoning sensuality since it will alleviate the pain of restraint, quite a handful of times on Reddit, SuttaCentral and even heard it from some ajhans. Does this view have any grounding in the suttas? Because, prima facie, it seems that such view contradicts many suttas (e.g. DN2) where a trainee get himself established in sila and restraint first, and only then he achieves jhana.

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1bz09ok/one_has_to_experience_the_pleasure_of_jhana/kyrmfcc/)** _2024-04-09 13:36:04_:

    The view might stem from a gross misreading of [MN 14](https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/MN/MN14.html#mn14note03):

    >Sensuality gives little gratification and much suffering and distress, and the woe in it is what's greater. Mahānāma, even though a noble disciple has seen this as it is with right understanding, as long as they do not achieve the joy and ease that are apart from sensuality and detrimental phenomena, or something even more peaceful than that, they still might return to sensuality. \* But when they do achieve that joy and ease, or something more peaceful than that, then they do not return to sensuality. \*

    "Not returning to sensuality" means becoming an anāgāmi, the point being that unless a noble disciple (sotāpanna or sakādāgami) has become established in jhāna, they still be *liable* to thoughts and intentions of sensuality. But it does not imply at all that even a noble disciple, let alone a puthujjana, is justified in not being restrained until the jhāna is magically bestowed upon them. [No restraint means no jhāna; right restraint *is* jhāna](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.97/en/sujato?lang=en).

    As stated in AN 10.61, it is the misconduct of body, speech, and mind caused by lack of sense restraint that lies at the root of the five hindrances, so any practice of “jhāna” that somehow circumvents the need for sense restraint, putting the emphasis on various other things instead—having nothing to do with inclining the mind towards renunciation, [which is how jhāna comes about](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an9.41#an9.41:7.1-an9.41:7.18)—is sure to be misguided.

    >“Bhikkhus, having not given up these six things, it’s impossible to abide having entered upon the first jhāna. What six? Sensual desire, aversion, indolence and lethargy, restlessness and anxiety, and doubt. And the woe in sensuality hasn’t been seen clearly as it is with right understanding. \* “Not having given up these six things, it’s impossible to abide having entered upon the first jhāna.

    —[AN 6.73](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an6.73#an6.73:1.1-an6.73:1.5)

    It goes without saying that whoever does not practice sense restraint has not fulfilled the sixth prerequisite.

### Is experiencing less suffering the yardstick to judge the efficiency of a buddhist method ?

If I'm not mistaken it's when we experience less suffering thanks to implementing the Buddha's teaching that we can accept it without a doubt. If such is a case, how can we dismiss other buddhist teachings or even non buddhist teachings as dead-ends even though according to numerous autobiographies and testimonies those others methods (Dzogchen/Mahamudra/Advaita) produce an extinction of suffering ? For reference, [this gem of an answer from Bhikkhu Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1agagmv/possible_explanation_on_how_meditation_methods/) answers partly this question but doesn't address the suffering aspect which is why I'm posting this.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1bu9apb/is_experiencing_less_suffering_the_yardstick_to/kxv2ase/)** _2024-04-03 15:05:56_:

    No, "experiencing less suffering" is practically speaking not an accurate measure, because that can be achieved through various other means, including other religions, which from a Buddhist point of view are based upon wrong view.

    The way to tell that a teaching works is that it pushes you to first and foremost acknowledge your liability to suffering *more* instead of less, and frees you from the whole "size" of that liability even while it's there, rather than the opposite way most teachings go of encouraging you to *ignore* the fact that you're liable to suffering, uncertainty and disappointment by getting absorbed on something that you have greater control over, and then helping you cover up the issue even more by layering various poetic concepts and mystical notions over it.

    For example, a person would be free from attachment towards things they depend on and not suffer if something happens to them because "in ultimate reality" there are no "things" for them anymore, but just a heap of [*kalapas*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalapa_(atomism)) \*(\*or whatever other fancy metaphysical idea their individual approach rests upon), whereas the Buddha's teaching would force you to acknowledge the significance of the things you hold dear and free you from all delight and attachment as well as lamentation and despair *while their significance remains.* It's like you're no longer frightened by a scary figure because you put a mask over it, instead of *actually* having become fearless.

    >There are some ascetics and brahmins who perceive that it’s day when in fact it’s night, or perceive that it’s night when in fact it’s day. \* This way of being of theirs is muddled, I say. I perceive that it’s night when in fact it is night, and perceive that it’s day when in fact it is day. And if there’s anyone of whom it may be rightly said that a being not liable to muddledness has arisen in the world for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans, it’s of me that this should be said.

    —[MN 4](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn4)

    As a corollary to this, the right practice of Dhamma will for most people (especially today) be more unsettling than reassuring in the early stages, because it requires uncovering a wound (the liability to suffering) that has been festering for ages but had been kept at bay with a combination of bandages and morphine.

### Right View vs. Fruit of Stream Entry

Would it be correct to state that Right View as an understanding of 'what needs to be done' comes about as a precursor and pre-requisite to the 'experience' of Stream Entry ?

In other words, Right View constitutes the knowledge of the path and practice that can lead to a temporary 'event' where one experiences freedom from the hindrances. Is this an accurate statement to make ?

If this is accurate, would Right View be a precursor to an *inevitable* Stream Entry fruition ?

    >Would it be correct to state that Right View as an understanding of 'what needs to be done' comes about as a precursor and pre-requisite to the 'experience' of Stream Entry ?

    Yes, a person on the path to stream entry could be said  to possess the Right View. With that I mean the [first of the 8 noble individuals](https://suttacentral.net/sn25.1/en/sujato?lang=en) who is already[ guaranteed to become an Arahant eventually](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn34#mn34:10.1-mn34:10.2), and not just any devoted "Buddhist practitioner" (see comment at the second link). 

    >In other words, Right View constitutes the knowledge of the path and practice that can lead to a temporary 'event' where one experiences freedom from the hindrances. Is this an accurate statement to make ?

    Not quite. There is no "event where you *experience* freedom from the hindrances", in the sense that it *"*comes over you" one evening by itself. The hindrances are abandoned [through *diligence*](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=sn35.246)*,* (with uncompromising virtue and sense restraint as necessary prerequisites) so it's whenever that person who is already a noble one is steadfast enough in doing that work that they will acquire the "fruit" of stream entry, of which the release and joy are secondary and not to be emphasized at all. What actually matters is that they gained unshakable certainty in their *understanding*, and thereby given up the first three fetters. They would've unavoidably solidified their understanding at the time of death anyway, as stated in SN 25.1, but that's the worst case scenario.

### Guarding the sense doors

Hi, I've been quite interested in this practice for the past few months, and I find that I've been in contemplation/meditation for a while, I can experience what this means. I've also experienced glimpses of the deathless before, so I get it on that "level" as well. However, with my normal waking mind, this is quite difficult. I try but the practice seems to have little no potency. 

&#x200B;

I would like to be able to practice throughout the day, during my "normal" life and I'd like to practice it more effectively when I am deciding to train. Do you have suggestions for both situations? I read in another post about sights being the easiest to start with, does it make sense to start there? I made a list of signs and features you might perceive with the eye: 

&#x200B;

 

* Labels
* Names
* Beautiful.Ugly 
* Tall/short
* Meaning
* Color
* Thin/fat
* Far/near
* Shape
* Color
* Texture, smooth, jagged etc. 
* Memories they provoke
* Ideas and beliefs they provoke
* The emotions and feelings they provoke

&#x200B;

Does this seem useful, am I missing anything? Any thoughts/feedback would be helpful. 

&#x200B;

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1bte1mb/guarding_the_sense_doors/kxq2dia/)** _2024-04-02 17:07:31_:

    Sense restraint is not about preventing any of the things you listed from arising, which is unsustainable and ultimately impossible. It's about the recognition that *what* you perceive is not up to you to decide, but that you are certainly responsible for whether you choose to allow your mind to get sucked into those perceptions in such a way that desire or aversion increase.

    >Having seen a sight with the eye, he doesn’t grasp at signs and features of it on account of which—due to abiding with the eye faculty unrestrained—bad, detrimental phenomena of longing and upset would flow in on him. He practices to restrain that; he guards the eye faculty and brings about the restraint of the eye faculty. 

    Most people hold the view that their defilements are the fault of the objects and thoughts that arise for them, and from that the natural course of action is to try to shut everything out. But the defilements are in your *attitude* towards the objects, and if that is not clearly seen, you cannot possibly know what the signs that either nurture or diminish that attitude are. And precisely because people see the practice as involving suppression of everything, it creates this artificial distinction between "normal life" and "practice time", since you clearly can't be living with that intense focusing on every twitch of your attention all the time. But the defilements, when discerned clearly, can and should be restrained 24/7 even while you go about your life (as long as it doesn't involve breaking the precepts, see below), and you would never get tired or wound up from that unbroken practice. On the contrary,[ it's where the true peace comes from.](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.94/en/bodhi?lang=en)

    Also, sense restraint is always the stage that comes after virtue and seeing the danger in the slightest fault in the [Gradual Training](https://suttacentral.net/mn107/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=sidebyside&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin), so it's impossible to do it properly unless one is already proficient in never transgressing the 8 precepts. Sense restraint will not help you make keeping the precepts easier; it's the other way around: purifying your bodily and verbal actions from desire and aversion *first* will eventually allow you to discern how, on the subtler mental level that sense restraint operates within, those same defilements arise.

### Sankhara as an attitude?

I was reading the translation Ven. Anigha released for MN 35 and found this interesting [note](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn35#mn35:4.5-mn35:4.6) here which states:

> saṅkhāras are, strictly speaking, neither the simplistic “choices”, nor the abstruse “fabrications/volitional formations”. They are “movements” in the most general sense, but they need not always be fully deliberate. For instance, a puthujjana's misconceiving of the aggregates as “mine” is a saṅkhāra (SN 22.81), but because they're unable to recognize that attitude as a saṅkhāra—and thereby straight away as impermanent, in which case they would irreversibly cease to be a puthujjana—that “activity” continues to take place. It is therefore not possible to simply choose not to take things as self: that saṅkhāra is neither a “choice” nor an “intention”.

SN 22.81 states the following:

> Here, bhikkhus, the uninstructed worldling, who is not a seer of the noble ones and is unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma, who is not a seer of superior persons and is unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma, regards form as self. That regarding, bhikkhus, is a formation.

I'm unable to understand this, maybe I can sum up the difficulties in comprehending this into different parts:

1. Why is that "regarding" an activity?
2. It makes sense for that "regarding" to be an attitude: I simply *find* myself already having appropriat*ed* this experience as a whole *for me*. But this understanding of that "regarding" as an attitude seems incompatible with that "regarding" being an activity. One is implicit (attitude), whilst the other is explicit (activity).

    >1. Why is that "regarding" an activity?

    >2. It makes sense for that "regarding" to be an attitude: I simply *find* myself already having appropriat*ed* this experience as a whole *for me*. But this understanding of that "regarding" as an attitude seems incompatible with that "regarding" being an activity. One is implicit (attitude), whilst the other is explicit (activity).

    \* Because it's something that can be brought to an end, something that's “taking place” rather than something that's static (in which case one would be hopelessly subjected to it and thus to suffering). Of course, a puthujjana cannot stop regarding things as self simply by trying, but that's because they haven't recognized the "regarding" as it is to begin with. Thus, whatever they might think needs to be stopped will not be *that* activity, but rather some other one that's secondary to it. If they did recognize it, they would give it up immediately as the Sutta says, but then they wouldn't be a puthujjana anymore.

    In other words, the root of the puthujjana's problem is not that he regards things as self, but that he can't even recognize *how* he's regarding things as self—it's an ignorance of ignorance (\*\*§\*\*25 of [Ñāṇavīra's Note on PS](https://nanavira.org/notes-on-dhamma/paticcasamuppada)). That's why your efforts should always be directed at rectifying your views about what the sense of self and ignorance even are, rather than at relinquishing whatever you may currently think those things are.

    \* The attitude will feel implicit to the extent that it's not understood. But the more the "dust" that is obscuring it is cleared out ([through none other than virtue and sense restraint](https://suttacentral.net/an10.61/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=sidebyside&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin)), the attitude gradually begins to become more explicit. Once there is not a trace of doubt about what the attitude is, the attitude will be gone, and that's stream-entry. Then, for a stream-enterer or higher, taking things as "mine" (the subtler *asmimāna* as opposed to the coarse *sakkāyadiṭṭhi* of the puthujjana) *is* in a sense a matter of explicit choice, which is why they're instructed not to do so in MN 1 and throughout the discourses.

### Why is fear not explicity called out as a hindrance ?

I have been wondering this for sometime now, and as far as I can tell it is likely because fear is embedded within the first two hindrances of sense-desire, and ill-will. 

The way I see it, fear is the manifestation of the pain of the likely unfulfilment of sense-desire, or cessation of object of sense-desire. 

In this regard, fear is also the underlying proximate cause for ill-will in.

However, the phenomenon of fear is such a primal one - and the Buddha also spoke about it specifically in Suttas (Fear & Terror).

I am curious regarding the treatment of fear as a hindrance, and the nature of practice that strikes at the root of it.

My understanding is that *freedom* from fear, is synonymous with having attained the deathless - since the likelihood of fear persists as long as death applies (i.e. the phenomena of person-hood still remains). Hence one is free from the fear of death (and consequently *any* fear), only at the attainment of the final knowledge. 

Kindly correct my understanding if inaccurate.

    Fear could be considered as being within the fourth hindrance, which is agitation/anxiety in general. It's also the 9th of the 10 fetters, abandoned only by an Arahant.

### Just sit and die?

Hypothetically speaking, if you really got yourself rid of desire (you won't leave your meditation to chase some sort of sensual pleasure, like "let me go and grab a snack" or "let me watch a movie"), and you get yourself rid of aversion (any pain or discomfort from sitting won't disturb you, not even if you sit for hours), and you have contentment/equanimity (you're completely content while meditating, you don't need anything else, you're OK), wouldn't you just "sit there" and die then?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1bnlq71/just_sit_and_die/kwnl9bz/)** _2024-03-26 15:35:26_:

    No, what you're describing as freedom from desire and aversion is becoming a robot (unfortunately confused with Arahantship quite often). 

    An Arahant still [experiences motivation to do things](https://suttacentral.net/an8.82/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin), as that is part of the five aggregates, [even in samādhi](https://suttacentral.net/mn111/en/sujato?lang=en). 

    But the difference with an ordinary person is that such actions are never rooted in a sense of entitlement to feel one thing and not feel something else (see [this reply](https://reddit.com/comments/1bni9q7/comment/kwlzdi6) for more on what that means). So if the action he was motivated to do does not produce the expected results, he will not suffer at all, having fully understood that his own experience does not belong to him. And that difference in the way they see things would not even be necessarily apparent to someone else from the outside, apart from the fact that there are [a few specific things](https://suttacentral.net/an9.8/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin) an Arahant can never do (and which someone who hopes to move closer to Arahantship should certainly not be doing either).

### Not acting out of any feeling

I was reading the article by Sister Medhini about fixed views vs unfixed certainties (https://www.hillsidehermitage.org/fixed-views-vs-unfixed-certainties) and towards the end she says "if you train towards not acting out of feeling to any extent at all...." 
This seems amazing to me. Is this how we should train?

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1bni9q7/not_acting_out_of_any_feeling/kwlzdi6/)** _2024-03-26 07:18:18_:

    There is a difference between acting "with" a feeling and acting "out of" a feeling. The latter means that your action is rooted in either desire to increase a pleasant feeling or resistance to an unpleasant feeling. But if you make an action without either of those attitudes regarding the feeling that is there, you didn't act "out" of it.

    For this to make sense, it must be understood that "feeling" is always a broad mental phenomenon, and it's, to put it roughly, what you're referring you when replying to the question "how are you doing right now?".  A feeling is emphatically not a physical sensation.

    When you're hungry, there would normally be both an unpleasant feeling (i.e., a mental uneasiness), and a physical sensation in your stomach. An action of eating would be "acting out" of the present feeling if you eat in order to get rid of the mental displeasure, as opposed to just the physical phenomenon of hunger. In other words, if your motivation behind eating is emotional. You would know that it is because there's some particular food that you want, for instance, as opposed to just about anything that will quell the physiological hunger.

    With any feeling, there is an endless range of things that you can do which would not be a form of acting "out of it". If your mind is obsessed by the pleasant feeling of some sensual object, you can do chores, go for a walk, read, think about other things—pretty much anything that does not entail engaging with that object by body, speech, or mind. So "never acting out of feelings" does not entail locking yourself up in a dark cave and never moving a limb ever again.

### Only an anagami removes hindrance of doubt?!

In [another post](https://www.reddit.com/user/Additional_Fix8417/), Additional\_Fix8417 has said that:

>Edit: regarding vicikiccha, it is only doubt in the Buddha’s Teaching that is uprooted by the sotapanna. The sekha up until anagami still faces the hindrance of doubt (doubt as a general phenomenon, as it is tied to mama)

Without doubt as a fetter, how can it ever be a hindrance? It is like saying "*without roots, that plant will still grow and bother me*". The sotapanna removes all doubt regarding Buddha's Teaching  (*though he, and even an Arahant can still be ignorant/doubtful about unrelated worldly things disconnected from the Dhamma. An Arahant needs to ask for directions and ask people's names*).

Please explain.

Thank you.

    A sotāpanna is beyond doubt regarding the Triple Gem and regarding their own understanding, but they are still subject to resisting displeasure on a subtler level. The five hindrances are simply five alternative ways in which that tendency can manifest; they're not fundamentally different from each other, so you can't have three or four of them instead of five. If one of them is there, all the others are there by implication. So without fully having transcended the hindrance of sensuality for example, which a sotāpanna hasn't, the hindrance of doubt cannot but be there too.

    The fetter of doubt is not on the same level as this—it's not doubt about this or that. It's specifically about how the puthujjana lacks certainty about what the way out of suffering is. So, in other words, if a sotāpanna is not diligent enough in recollecting the same understanding that already freed them from the fetter of doubt and that they cannot doubt, the hindrance of doubt will be lingering; if he does make effort, the hindrance will necessarily fade. But the puthujjana is still in the woods about his understanding to begin with, so that he may not even be able to give up the hindrance of doubt no matter how hard he tries. That is due to the fetter of doubt.

### Trying to grasp how to not act out on a mental level (inspired by the recent video)

When my mind encounters a pleasant idea, for example a sexual fantasy, I understand that if I were to pursue it or, in other words, start to entertain it or delight in it, I would be acting unskillfully i.e. I would be acting out of pressure by trying to develop this thought further. When this understanding (that pursuing this idea is unskillful) happens some sort of a "click" occurs, for the lack of a better word, which "blocks" my engagement with such thought, and, afterwards, this thought retreats into the background of my awareness (so it is not in my immediate focus anymore, but I can still feel the pressure of it, so to speak)  while I continue whatever I was doing at that moment. I'm not trying to actively dispel such thoughts like some people might do with their intrusive thoughts.

So, is this the correct way of restraint on the mental level? Thanks

(Sorry for somewhat clumsy description, just want to understand how to practice).

    >So, is this the correct way of restraint on the mental level? Thanks

    Yes, in theory. But if it's not already resulting in the first jhāna by itself, it means that there's still some form of inaccuracy present (either still welcoming the thoughts somewhat or still denying them somewhat), and this would be  maintained by lack of restraint on the physical and verbal level. If that isn't impeccable, then it might *seem* like one is discerning the mental level correctly while actually one isn't. Discerning mental unwholesome actions correctly and restraining them would have to result in the impossibility of unwholesome bodily and verbal actions, not in simply repressing them or forgetting about the possibility to do them.

### In DN 21 and AN 9.3 what is the cutting of thought and reflexion referring to ?

Engaged in a conversation on another forum these two suttas were mentioned where the stopping of thinking and pondering is presented as a worthwhile goal and a usecase for anapanasati. It got me wondering as I've never heard about it before. I think in DN 21 the Buddha may be talking about first and second jhana where in the second thinkong and pondering are absent hence more happiness but I can't be sure. No idea for AN 9.3. What do you think ?

[DN21](https://preview.redd.it/4h2anxgkebpc1.png?width=1812&format=png&auto=webp&s=e73b0633fcae7924060be01dcd27c6ddfe59250a)

    Firstly, it's easy to overlook what the Buddha states as coming before those four practices at the end:

    >...  
    (5) A bhikkhu with good, friends, companions, and associates is expected to be wise, to be endowed with the understanding related to arising and passing away that is *noble, penetrative, and leads to the complete exhaustion of suffering.* **\[= a bhikkhu is a sotāpanna at least\]**

    >But then, a bhikkhu *grounded on these five things* should develop four further things.

    —AN 9.3

    (It's also clear from the context that "good friend" (*kalyāṇamitta*) is someone who could elucidate on and thus help you to attain such understanding, and therefore they must possess it themselves. It doesn't simply mean anyone who also happens to be a Buddhist).

    *Ānāpānasati* leads to the "cutting off of thoughts (*vitakka*)" if practiced correctly because it's about precisely the opposite of what people would generally think it is. Establishing the context of the body breathing as a background makes particular thoughts (*vitakka*) lose their significance and therefore subside because they're being undermined through *yoniso manasikāra.* That means that while they arise, they're being known as standing upon the necessary foundation of this body (that breathes).

    This is another story altogether than the usual focusing on your *sensations* of breathing in order to suppress your thinking, which is ironically prioritizing and increasing *vitakka* (immediacy) and overriding *vicāra* (reflexion/context), while it should always be the other way around.

    >“When this composure has been developed and cultivated by you in this way, then you should develop this composure with thinking (vitakka) and pondering (vicāra); you should develop it without thinking but with pondering only; you should develop it without thinking and without pondering.

    —AN 8.63

    Focusing on sensations (*vitakka)* can successfully be accomplished by children in the span of one meditation session, while, as the Sutta clearly says, what's actually being described requires the Right View (as well as virtue, learning from other noble individuals, and diligent effort in abandoning unwholesome states).

    Regarding DN 21, the fact that the happiness that doesn't have thinking and without pondering is better than that which does is simply a statement that the second jhāna is better than the first, and that should be uncontroversial. But the Buddha also stated that one who tries to enter the second jhāna without being steady in the first (which is *characterized* by thinking and pondering) will fail to get either of them (AN 9.35), and this is exactly what people are usually attempting to do.

### Skilful boundary for contemplation practice

To what extent is is beneficial/unbenefical to bring to mind circumstances that would cause one to suffer, as a means of ascertaining one's liability to still suffer? 

Just as it would not be wise to subject oneself to circumstances provocative of sensuality, in order to verify or test one’s endurance of it - would it not also apply to bringing up ‘thoughts’ pertaining to circumstances that are provocative of fear/anger/anxiety etc.? 

However, one of the suggestions Ajahn makes in his talks are to ask yourself from time to time ‘am I still liable to suffer / what could cause me to suffer’. 

How is one to understand where the skilful boundary lies in such an evaluation; so as to not overstep into the territory of unbeneficial. 

Many thanks in advance

### Anagami and Arahants are in constant Jhana?

I was contemplating the hindrances and noticed that if all that was required to get into jhana was the temporary abandonment of the hindrances then that would appear to contradict the suttas. Ironically, in my contemplation I was contemplating the hindrance of doubt, and this question is certainly present on the basis of that hindrance, so in a sense I'm just pushing back my progress in terms of discerning the escape from the hindrances.

But simultaneously, I discerned a sense of fear that I thought was gone for good; I thought I was no longer liable to a significant protection towards 'my' worldview, but it seems I was wrong. So instead of just enduring doubt, I decided it would be a better endeavor for me to further push myself in a position of fear and endure *that*.

Now that I've established my intention here, I'll get to the actual issue.

It's quite clear from the suttas that hindrances need to be temporarily abandoned to abide in the jhanas. The Buddha compares the five hindrances to a prison, and it's clear that to abide in the jhanas, one must *escape* the prison and not just be at the mercy of the prison guards and just not get tortured by them for some time. Hence, the argument of simply 'doing away' with sensual desire temporarily without having explicitly discerned its escape beforehand and *actually* having escaped doesn't seem to hold. However, if discerning the escape from the hindrances is sufficient for jhanas, then that means an anagami, who would've ended any sensual desire (and consequently, ended all hindrances, as far as I can see), would be abiding in jhana constantly. And the same with an arahant.

However, this doesn't seem to measure up well with the suttas:

>'Sir, this is not my only incredible and amazing quality; there is another. Whenever I want, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, **I enter and remain in the first absorption**, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, **I enter and remain in the second absorption**, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected. And with the fading away of rapture, **I enter and remain in the third absorption**, where I meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’ With the giving up of pleasure and pain, and the ending of former happiness and sadness, **I enter and remain in the fourth absorption**, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.'  
>  
>AN 7.53

Nanda's mother is an anagami who can abide in all four jhanas, however, the fact that she states "whenever I want, ..., I enter and remain in the first absorption" suggests that there's a state where she *isn't* in the first jhana. But that normal abiding of hers should already be an abiding devoid of the hindrances as she destroyed the fetter of sensuality. So it appears that jhanas are abandonment of the hindrances + something else, and I'm unsure of what that 'something else' is.

In [SN 4.23](https://suttacentral.net/sn4.23/en/bodhi?lang=en&reference=none&highlight=false), we see the Arahant Godhika who's unable to remain in the "liberation of mind", which I thought referred to jhanas, but that doesn't seem to be the case as it's not mentioned in Pali. But then what can it be apart from jhana since the mind is already liberated for an arahant? Or maybe he wasn't an Arahant considering liberation of mind refers to that, and attained it when the moment he killed himself?

But I also remember reading some sutta where the Buddha or some arahant had some sort of pain and then decided to dwell in jhana (not sure if it was first or higher ones though) but the sutta seems to have just disappeared..

**EDIT**: It appears, at least currently, that I've solved the conundrum I was in through shameless use of analysis (instead of trying to discern escape from the hindrances, presently, thereby entertaining heedlessness). I would appreciate thoughts on this if possible:

AN 1.53 states that one with a mind of metta is not devoid of jhana:

>“If, mendicants, a mendicant develops a mind of love even as long as a finger-snap, they’re called a mendicant who does not lack absorption, who follows the Teacher’s instructions, who responds to advice, and who does not eat the country’s alms in vain. How much more so those who make much of it!”

However, according to MN 55, the Buddha *constantly* abides with that mind of metta:

>“Yes, sir. Sir, I have heard that Brahmā abides in love. Now, I’ve seen the Buddha with my own eyes, and it is the Buddha who truly abides in love.”  
>  
>“Any greed, hate, or delusion that might give rise to ill will has been given up by the Realized One, cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and is unable to arise in the future. If that’s what you were referring to, I acknowledge it.”

Thus, through basic *modus ponens* here, one can argue that the Buddha -- in his *constant* abiding -- isn't devoid of jhana. The only way I can currently conceive of contesting this is if one argues either of the following:

1. That either one of the translations are wrong
2. That either one of the suttas are inauthentic
3. That when the Buddha says that one with a mind of metta isn't devoid of jhana he doesn't *really* mean jhana (or he means a variant of 'jhana' that isn't discussed of in any of the suttas)

I cannot adequately assess accuracy of any claims to (1) or (2) due to my lacking analytical capabilities. However, (3) can be axiomatically rejected on the basis that the Buddha -- being the foremost of the teachers out there -- wouldn't willingly entertain a contradiction (A is not-A) so as to lead astray many of his potential disciples.

The issue that one is now presented with is the task of reconciling this interpretation with the supposed implication that an anagami is capable of abiding in non-jhana as mentioned in AN 7.53. After reflecting on the language, one can notice that stating "whenever I want I can remain in the first, second, third, fourth jhana" doesn't imply that one's default abiding is a state that is *not* those four states.

For example, humans can rightly state "whenever I want, I can enter and remain on the ground, in the underground, or above the ground"; these would be the only possible states of existence in space for a human with reference to the earth, but that doesn't mean that in stating this I'm existing in an area apart from such spaces.

Anyways, I certainly need to stop my analysis here otherwise I'll go back into even more of my previous analysis-inclined mind, which would exist in contradiction to heedfulness.

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1bdeya6/anagami_and_arahants_are_in_constant_jhana/kuodx6c/)** _2024-03-13 13:57:55_:

    Arahants and Anāgāmis are most certainly not constantly in jhāna. If that were the case, the Suttas wouldn't exist, since[ speech ceases in the very first jhāna](https://suttacentral.net/sn36.11/en/bodhi?lang=en)

    SN 17.30 also states that an Arahant can lose their "pleasant abiding in the present experience " (*diṭṭhadhammasukhavihāra*), an epithet for the jhānas, if things that obstruct solitude take up too much of their time.

    >The Buddha compares the five hindrances to a prison, and it's clear that to abide in the jhanas, one must *escape* the prison and not just be at the mercy of the prison guards and just not get tortured by them for some time. Hence, the argument of simply 'doing away' with sensual desire temporarily without having explicitly discerned its escape beforehand and *actually* having escaped doesn't seem to hold.

    That is true, but at the same time it doesn't mean that this escape would be permanent. The freedom from hindrances is indeed absolute and immovable while it's there; it's not that you simply "forgot" about these things for a few hours because you were focused on your meditation object. In other words, that state is such that even if you tried to arouse hindrances, you would fail, in the same way that in the past you would have failed if you tried *not* to have them. That's because what either overcomes or is affected by the hindrances is the *citta,* not *mano* or the other five senses, and all volition and direct control can only happen through *mano*.

    But if you don't protect the things that brought the citta to that "invincible" state, i.e., virtue, restraint, and seclusion, it would eventually fade away. An Arahant would not lose the first two, but they would on a daily basis be losing the third, on account of practical necessities like going for alms round.

You get to see the citta in the way that actually allows you to develop it only by restraining yourself from the actions which by default run with the inclinations of the citta, and by not delighting in company and [dwelling in solitude.](https://suttacentral.net/an6.68/en/sujato?lang=en) To the extent you keep acting out of greed, aversion, and delusion to any degree, you are precisely adding to the ignorance of what the citta is.

    Once you start to see more clearly what the mind is on account of that basic training that basically "pulls you back in" from the level of the world and objects, you would get to see that aversion is not something that "happens" to you by accident—which is the only thing that would justify having to manage it and get rid of it through various secondary methods and exercises. Aversion is there because you intentionally let your mind take pleasure in the idea of removing unpleasant feelings that came on their own. And if you now see that attitude and are thus able to abandon it, mettā would automatically be there, because in the ultimate sense the problem was never the person or what they did to you. They were just the scapegoat for the realm problem: fact that you wanted to get rid of the unpleasant feeling. Now that that's not there, there would be no reason for you to not have a friendly disposition towards them.

    But without the sufficient preliminary training in virtue and restraint mentioned above, that subtle internal choice to resist the unpleasant feeling, which is the unwholesome attitude of the citta, would've never become apparent. You would instead be still trying to deal with the people that are causing that unpleasant feeling, by repeating the mantra "may you be well" and whatnot, ironically perpetuating the wrong view that the problem is on the side of the person or situation instead of your mistaken relationship to your own aggregates/senses.

### Can you observe the mind?

I’ve seen somewhere on HH that it isn’t possible to do this. Assuming the mind is not its thoughts; I am observing my thoughts? Feelings? 

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1b52k3t/can_you_observe_the_mind/kt5qzoy/)** _2024-03-03 15:43:19_:

    The mind (citta) cannot be recognized as an object or through direct perception, including the "mental eye" (mano). The mind is, practically speaking, the domain where attitudes are held regarding the things you experience, including your innermost thoughts and feelings. That is to say, the mind is not the experiencing of a pleasant feeling, for example, but the attitude of welcoming and delighting in it (or the opposite if the mind has been trained). Therefore we often say that the mind is "always peripheral" to what you're attending to.

    This "indirect" nature of the mind is the reason why the Buddha compared  the individual who recognizes their own mind with a [skilled cook who picks up on the preferences of his master](https://suttacentral.net/sn47.8/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin). The cook does not *hear* the king saying "I like this dish; I don't like that one" (i.e., one does not apprehend the mind as an object), but he instead is able to indirectly infer the king's preference based on what he does with x and y dish. In the same way, you know your mind as that which inclines towards or away from experiences and harbors greed, aversion and delusion towards them.

    The citta starts to become apparent bit by bit through the Gradual Training, because the mind is that which insists in acquiring pleasure and getting rid of displeasure even when you set boundaries on that through your direct intention. It starts to become evident that there is that unclear "something" in your experience that keeps trying to go left even though you're earnestly trying to go right, so to speak.

    >"do my efforts *really* contribute to the kind of merit that could mean I can continue practicing towards the dhamma in a different life, beyond the death of my body?"

    Unfortunately, it is safe assume that that won't happen unless you at least become a sotāpanna. The things that you think of as "the Dhamma" while still being a puthujjana, and your motivations for practicing them, are things that you will lose when you die.

    You will certainly reap mundane rewards proportional to the corresponding effort that you put into virtue, restraint, generosity, and non-greed and non-aversion, but that doesn't mean that the "practice" as such would get carried over. That would only be the case for a noble disciple.

### Formal Meditation

What is the right way to go about formal meditation? Choose a context and let the mind revolve around that context? How do you all practice? 


Edit: when I say formal meditation I mean set time aside to contemplate certain themes that the Buddha recommends to reflect on like death, impermanence, un-ownability of the aggregates, dangers of sensuality, etc 

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1b3syte/formal_meditation/ksv3v4t/)** _2024-03-01 15:37:54_:

    As u/SDC pointed out, it's not a problem to set aside dedicated periods of reflection. What we advise against is "formal meditation" in the sense of taking up some sort of exercise, *whatever* that may be, with the purpose of having some sort of special insight or experience resulting from it, failing to see that the relevant insight is found at the level where your views and assumptions with which you try to overcome suffering are.

    Instead, you'd just be trying to address whatever you *now* think suffering is, by overcoming whatever you *now* think craving is, in order to reach whatever you *now* think freedom from it is, by means of whatever you *now* think the path is. Since those background assumptions remain essentially untouched, you would actually remain stagnant on the level that matters, irrespective of how many liberative experiences and novel releases you achieve sitting on that cushion.

    Then there's also the fact that most of the time it doesn't actually affect, or not sufficiently at least, people's lifestyle "off the cushion", while in reality the choices affected with craving that one makes through one's life are what's most prominently responsible for one's suffering, not the lack of proficiency in whatever exercise the chosen meditation revolves around.

    The right "formal meditation" would be therefore about continuously questioning, discarding, and finally upgrading one's views about what meditation even should be if it is to lead to the end of suffering, for example, and about contemplating what exactly is hindering one from reaching that.

    Once this work is finished, and sotāpatti has been reached, as it inevitably would be, formal meditation is about being in solitude and purifying the mind from hindrances and craving, having now acquired the direct knowledge of what those phenomena actually are.

### Questions on the right view

I had a couple of questions on the right view and would be grateful for any clarifications on this:

1. How is one with the right view sure that their mind will never lose this understanding? Just like all the other things in the experience that are liable to change, what is the property of mind that makes this kind of understanding not change?
2. Is the above knowledge of lets say the "permanence" of right view always known to the one with right view?

Thank you.

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1b38994/questions_on_the_right_view/ksv85ok/)** _2024-03-01 16:02:24_:

    >How is one with the right view sure that their mind will never lose this understanding? Just like all the other things in the experience that are liable to change, what is the property of mind that makes this kind of understanding not change?

    They would know that they have understood even the experience of not knowing, such that even if they were to completely forget everything they know about the Dhamma, they would still not suffer. That is how you know that you have arrived at the understanding that uproots things, instead of managing them, because the salient quality of management is its dependence on things that you learned and became skilled at, and could therefore gradually forget and lose your proficiency in. Just like any ordinary ability. That dependence on memories, perceptions, and acquired information is what's in common to every meditation method, and even the "insights" that may come out of them, which is why that can never result in anything but transient and conditioned freedom.

    >Is the above knowledge of lets say the "permanence" of right view always known to the one with right view?

    It's the same principle as the following:

    >“But Master Ānanda, when a mendicant is perfected, would the knowledge and vision that their defilements are ended be constantly and continually present to them, while walking, standing, sleeping, and waking?”

    >“Well then, Sandaka, I shall give you a simile. For by means of a simile some sensible people understand the meaning of what is said. Suppose there was a person whose hands and feet had been amputated. Would they be aware that their hands and feet had been amputated constantly and continually, while walking, standing, sleeping, and waking? Or would they be aware of it only when they checked it?”

    >“They wouldn’t be aware of it constantly, only when they checked it.”

    >“In the same way, when a mendicant is perfected, the knowledge and vision that their defilements are ended is not constantly and continually present to them, while walking, standing, sleeping, and waking. Rather, they are aware of it only when they checked it.”

### New Essay: Pervading the World with Friendliness



- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1b36ieh/new_essay_pervading_the_world_with_friendliness/ksutbkd/)** _2024-03-01 14:34:01_:

    u/foowfoowfoow 

    >equating this passive harmlessness with active intentional goodwill is an error.

    >grey is not black certainly, but it is not white. 

    The "passive harmlessness" that you're describing is not mettā. It's simply a mind still liable to ill will that momentarily does not have it. If the mental state does not fit the description the Buddha gives, then the tendency to ill will has not been sufficiently subdued. That's absolutely not the same as saying that "active intentional goodwill" has not been sufficiently fabricated.

    >even in the suttas you have quoted, the buddha directs monks to actively develop goodwill after abandoning ill will. this points to the two mental states being non-equivalent.

    It points them to foster and nurture the mental state that they already achieved. In MN 40 for instance, it clearly says that the monk abides in the liberation of mind through mettā having properly abandoned the unwholesome states that obstructed it. It does not say that first they abandon the unwholesome states, then they "do" their mettā practice, and ***then*** they abide with a mind full of mettā towards the whole world. 

    And yes, that state then has to be further cultivated, nobody says that there is no effort involved; there is, just as one must further develop and steady the first jhāna after attaining it. The point is not that mettā does not require effort at all, but that you don't get it by directly generating some preconceived idea of mettā *while* you still have the susceptibility to ill will, because that mettā, no matter how agreeable it feels, will be necessarily tainted by craving and hindrances, and thus not be of any value.  This is what the quote from AN 8.63 is referring to.

    In the excerpt from MN 55, the Buddha states that he can be said to abide in mettā as Brahmā would because he has destroyed any passion, aversion, and delusion on account of which ill will could arise. He doesn't say "I abide in mettā because I indeed have the greatest good will for all beings, like a mother for her child" or something along those lines.

### How to abandon deeply rooted views/goals

Dear friends,

From past practice, I have some bad habits (that get triggered automatically).

For example:

The suppressing thoughts/thinking. From past practice, I tried to "have a quiet mind with no disturbance" which ended up suppressing things, (and painfully too). However now I believe this has become an ingrained habit, that can happen automatically when the conditions are right. For example: 

1. Thought arrises
2. Mind (automatically) suppresses it
3. Pain from that suppression.

How do I remove this habit from my mind, and in general other bad (habitual/automatic) habits? 

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1b2odzt/how_to_abandon_deeply_rooted_viewsgoals/ksyv576/)** _2024-03-02 06:10:12_:

    You don't need to remove the habit directly. You just have to recognize that now, while that habit its taking place, you have a choice to simply recognize the "mind that wants to suppress" as "mind that wants to suppress", and simply not act out of it. That's how you would actually remove the fuel that's feeding that mental state.

    If you try to suppress the intention to suppress, you are actually feeding exactly the same habit in the name of overcoming it.

    >If you’re sinking in the mud yourself, Cunda, it is quite impossible for you to pull out someone else (**your own mind**) who is sinking in the mud. But if you’re not sinking in the mud yourself, it is quite possible for you to pull out someone else who is sinking in the mud. If you’re not tamed, trained, and extinguished yourself, it is quite impossible for you to help tame, train, and extinguish someone else. But if you are tamed, trained, and extinguished yourself, it is quite possible for you to help tame, train, and extinguish someone else.

    >In the same way, someone who is cruel extinguishes it by not being cruel. An individual who kills extinguishes it by not killing. ... (an individual who suppresses extinguishes it by not suppressing).

### "Rightly discerning aggregates is like penetrating a hair-tip with an arrow".. why?

I was reading this Sutta and came across this verse:

>“Those who see the five aggregates   
>  
>*Sukhumaṁ te paṭivijjhanti,*   
>  
>as other, not as self,   
>  
>*vālaggaṁ usunā yathā;*   
>  
>penetrate a subtle thing,   
>  
>*Ye pañcakkhandhe passanti,*   
>  
>like a hair-tip with an arrow.   
>  
>*parato no ca attato.*  
>  
>**Thag 20.1**

Why is it such a subtle and difficult thing to discern the aggregates as such? I mean, can't I simply enumerate "*this* form, *this* form, *this* form, any form whatsoever at all is impermanent, not me, not mine, not I am"? And the same for the other aggregates? That doesn't sound like such a difficult thing to do compared to the analogy given which is splitting a hair-tip with an arrow.

Is this perhaps related to the fact that discerning *any* form, far or near, large or small, with all its various permutations, is difficult to do? I don't really know how to do this apart from holding a thought of 'all form' -- which would extend an open awareness to discernable forms within the visual field -- and directing the idea of anicca towards it.

Now the other issue here is discerning consciousness; it cannot even be discerned because it escapes any attempts at discernment. Consciousness necessarily has to come first for there to be any discernment anyways, the fact that there is discernment means there is consciousness. Everything affirms the existence of consciousness (it is the that-because-of-which-everything-is) and there's an idea of permanence associated with it partly due to this fact.

Well, maybe I should reflect on what I mean by 'discerning' since perhaps this is in some sense its discernment. But either way, I cannot *observe* by any means, the change in consciousness. I can indirectly relate the presence of consciousness (through their even being the discernment of this body) to this enduring body, but then question whether consciousness and body really co-exist? Could it not be the case that this consciousness is more fundamental than the body and when the body ceases, there is only consciousness left?

I'm unsure. Maybe such a "subtle thing" is about "including the sense of self" into the picture as it is often discussed?

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1b2n8ws/rightly_discerning_aggregates_is_like_penetrating/ksnw5m8/)** _2024-02-29 07:01:58_:

    >I'm unsure. Maybe such a "subtle thing" is about "including the sense of self" into the picture as it is often discussed? 

    
    Yes. Even the most untrained puthujjana can see *instances* of form, feeling, etc. and know them as impermanent, etc. But what is subtle and hard to do is see those peripheral, more "personal" aspects of experience that you naturally takes for granted, and that endure *simultaneously* with the particular content, as also being within the aggregates. 

    
    A good example of this is the situation described in the [previous thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1b0g1ix/questions_on_the_samanadipa_vids/), where one recognizes that the attempt to even contemplate things and "practice" which seems fine superficially is underlain by a subtler aversion to the present feeling . That is a real part of your experience/five aggregates that is not recognized *while it's there*. 

    
    But if you embark on a quest to "catch" such background intentions and inclinations with your direct attention, you will for that very reason fail to see them, and there will be pressures and attitudes lurking underneath *that* activity you're engaging in. They are always there **in regard to** the things you attend to directly. To use Ajahn Nyanamoli's simile, it's like those stars in the sky that are seen only *as peripheral* to other starts, and disappear the moment you try to zone in on them. Knowing the aggregates as they are requires you to have sufficiently grasped the signs of the mind/developed sufficient yoniso manasikara, and that means being able to recognize these overlooked phenomena. 

    
    This is why the Buddha compared the aggregates to a murderer who earns your trust and kills you when you don't expect it. The way the householder in the simile places trust in that person and doesn't suspect them is analogous to how one overlooks the peripheral aspects of the five aggregates where all the assumptions and wrong attitudes become established. 

    
    To extend the simile, people would instead tend to think of the aggregates as things they can see from afar as they're approaching, and that's how the naive methodical and systematic attitudes toward the practice come about. You'd think you escaped the danger by warding off and "antidoting" these obvious thoughts and pressures and focusing on objects, while you continue to commune with the murderer. 

    
     Edit: The Sutta with the relevant simile is SN 22.85

### Questions on the Samanadipa vids


Theruwan saranai! These are some questions I have had for some time while listening to and contemplating Samanadipa's set of new videos. Forgive the length, as usual! 

1. In "Discerning the Middle Way", Bhante Anigha (I presume) points out that discernment of intentions should be about discerning one's attitude towards feeling, not about what one would state as their intention if one were to be asked. 

The example given in the video (34 min) is that intentions such as "I want to be admired/ understood" that go unnoticed while in company are closer to the sort of intentions you want to be discerning, NOT intentions like  "I-am-sweeping-today-bc-there-is-no-time-to-sweep-tomorrow", for ex.

My question is - what exactly is wrong with discernment of intentions in the way mentioned in the sweeping example?

 From my personal experience, it's possible that one COULD in fact be sweeping simply because it is a practical thing that happens to need to be done now ... NOT out of some sort of emotional compulsion or distraction, restlessness, desire, and so on. 
One may happen to feel neutral while sweeping, but that doesn't necessarily mean that they are sweeping BECAUSE they feel neutral. Action doesn't need to come OUT OF feeling, does it - action can be PARALLEL to feeling instead. 

To give an example of this "parallelness":
 I was listening to Dhamma talk yesterday afternoon and when I reflected on why I was doing it, I found that though my mood was pleasant while listening - I was not listening BECAUSE it was pleasant. Basically, the pleasant feeling was there, but was not the reason for me choosing to engage in that particular task. I could have just as easily sat quietly or read some suttas instead, without much mental resistance. 

In another instance, the same intention of wanting to listen to a talk arose with an almost palpable urge/pull to experience the pleasure of distraction. At that time, I wouldn't have been able to so easily choose to do something else - since in that state of mind, NOT distracting myself would be experienced unpleasantly. Acting OUT OF feeling. 

2. Yesterday morning I woke up in a pretty bad mood (the ambiguously nauseous kind). I then decided to "let the displeasure endure", and contemplated how the displeasure arose on its own and I had no say in it being there.

 Later, upon reflection, I realized that ALL of it - the "enduring", the contemplation - were ALL rooted in a subtle hope in my experience that my efforts would GET RID OF the bad mood. That the endurance would make the displeasure vanish once I got it right.  So what I initially thought to be khanti was fully enclosed within AVERSION (but not at the coarse level I'd usually see it in). 

Another time, I was sitting and was considering what topic I should choose to contemplate on, when I questioned myself why I wanted to contemplate in the first place. The answer was a subtle pressure towards the possibility of the peaceful feeling that often arises during contemplation. I then reflected that my entire intention to contemplate was rooted in a desire for pleasant feeling. If I did decide to contemplate anything other than my present situation there, my contemplation would have been WITHIN desire. 

Would these examples be more along the lines of how I should be discerning intentions in terms of one's attitude towards feeling? The push towards pleasure, the push away from pain - that dominate and envelop one's entire situation?

    >From my personal experience, it's possible that one COULD in fact be sweeping simply because it is a practical thing that happens to need to be done now ... NOT out of some sort of emotional compulsion or distraction, restlessness, desire, and so on. One may happen to feel neutral while sweeping, but that doesn't necessarily mean that they are sweeping BECAUSE they feel neutral. Action doesn't need to come OUT OF feeling, does it - action can be PARALLEL to feeling instead..

    That's true. But most people would not be seeing it that way when they hear the expression "the intention behind the action". They would often tend to review the logical/rational reasons for doing it at the expense of checking whether there is emotional pressure at the background pushing them to do it.

    When the action is "parallel" to the pressure as you put it and not rooted in it, then the stated reason for the action is irrelevant. You could even be misjudging the situation and making a mistake on worldly terms, but in terms of Dhamma the mistake is acting out of craving.

    >In another instance, the same intention of wanting to listen to a talk arose with an almost palpable urge/pull to experience the pleasure of distraction. At that time, **I wouldn't have been able to so easily choose to do something else** - since in that state of mind, NOT distracting myself would be experienced unpleasantly. Acting OUT OF feeling.

    Yes, and this is one instance where one would easily assume it's automatically fine because it's superficially a wholesome action. And the highlighted part is key in recognizing what is underlain by unwholesome intentions and what isn't.

    >Later, upon reflection, I realized that ALL of it - the "enduring", the contemplation - were ALL rooted in a subtle hope in my experience that my efforts would GET RID OF the bad mood.

    >Would these examples be more along the lines of how I should be discerning intentions in terms of one's attitude towards feeling? The push towards pleasure, the push away from pain - that dominate and envelop one's entire situation?

    Indeed, that's what is meant by an "underlying tendency", and also by "grasping the signs of the mind". The unskilled monk in SN 47.8 is superficially doing the work and genuinely thinks he's cultivating the right context. But behind that effort there would be a more subtle aversion (or delight and anticipation for an experience of relief), and because he doesn't see *that*, he can't possibly abandon the hindrances because he's, as it were, infecting himself in his very attempt to cure the infection, just not in the obvious way he'd be aware of.

    Seeing the attempt to get rid of a bad mood and including even that within what you're enduring and contemplating would be a quintessential example of "enduring things on the right level", and those more subtle intentions could not become palpably apparent to someone who isn't virtuous and restrained.

    Also, it's exactly this type of "subliminal" intention that is perpetually there during the deliberate implementation of a meditation method or technique, and people are not training themselves one bit towards grasping the signs of those intentions with that, since they're necessarily focused on what to "do" and the expected results. In fact, it's wrong even if that "doing" is precisely the right endurance, forsaking of methods, and right contemplations that we talk about, not to mention if it's full on object-focusing.

    In other words, the tendency to turn anything into a method is simply the tendency to overlook the signs of the mind. Now if on top of that the *instruction* is also in the form of a method, then not only are you already an "unskilled cook", but you're also being encouraged to remain as one.

    You suffer because you resist unpleasant feeling and want it to be otherwise, or crave for pleasant feeling to increase (because not enough pleasure is unpleasant). It doesn't matter if the source of those feelings is something "internal" that feels as if it's personal and you're responsible for it, like a bad mood. If you develop khanti towards that internal domain, it would be impossible to be bothered by external things, as well as to act out of the inner ones.

### Free from sensual desire = free from fear?

Hi fellow practitioners, 

Would it be correct to say that one free from the fetter of sensual desire would concurrently have eliminated all possibilities of fear and anxiety to arise? 
(as the non-returner / anagami, who is also free from ill will) 

That must be a sublime peaceful state!  

As greed & sensual desire is about obsessing about, wanting to obtain, or protecting this or that ‘pleasant thing’, and wishing to remove all ‘unpleasantries’ — once the underlying desire is uprooted, why would one even care? 
Whether things are pleasant, unpleasant or neutral, you have ‘no bets in the game’, you can’t win or lose. So logically, no fear would arise. 

Before coming across Ajahn Nyanamoli’s and HH’s teachings, I hadn’t deeply considered the ‘indirect’ approach of uprooting fear- and all suffering for that matter- by training oneself in virtue and sense restraint.

(Then there’s the question/curiosity of what happens to deeply rooted  “biological fears”, regarding survival for example - I would suppose anagamis, or even Arahants experience them as well- although as “first arrows” but no more. But maybe it’s fruitless to speculate on this point..) 

What do you think? Please share any related thoughts or comments you might have. 


Best wishes, 

A fearful person

    >Would it be correct to say that one free from the fetter of sensual desire would concurrently have eliminated all possibilities of fear and anxiety to arise? (as the non-returner / anagami, who is also free from ill will)

    Yes. What would remain for an anāgāmi is a subtler restlessness/agitation/uneasiness, not full-blown anxiety and fear.

    >(Then there’s the question/curiosity of what happens to deeply rooted “biological fears”, regarding survival for example - I would suppose anagamis, or even Arahants experience them as well- although as “first arrows” but no more. But maybe it’s fruitless to speculate on this point..)

    There's no such thing as a "deeply rooted biological fear". Certain especially forceful and threatening pressures exist for almost every set of 6 senses (e.g., a gun pointed at one's head), and each individual mind is either developed such that that *internal* threat does not turn into fear, or it isn't.

    >When a mendicant’s mind is rightly freed like this, even if potent sights come into the range of vision they don’t overcome their mind. The mind remains unaffected.

    >Suppose there was a mountain that was one solid mass of rock, without cracks or holes. Even if violent storms were to blow up out of the east, the west, the north, and the south, they couldn’t make it shake or rock or tremble.

    >In the same way, when a mendicant’s mind is rightly freed like this, even if potent sights come into the range of vision they don’t overcome their mind. … The mind remains unaffected. It is steady, imperturbable, observing disappearance.

    —AN 6.55

### What exactly is Anatta?

Is it a mindset of not regarding things as not self, or is it the thought that there really is no self.

A lot of teachers have different takes on this I would love to see what HH takes on this as well as more experienced posters in this sub.

  
Also I want to apologize if my point is not clear enough. English is not my first language, I hope everyone can understand.

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1aynqlc/what_exactly_is_anatta/krx7jch/)** _2024-02-24 14:26:25_:

    *Anattā* is about the fact that the aggregates are ultimately not in your control, as demonstrated by MN 35 and SN 22.59. It's not about whether you *deliberately* call things "me" and "mine" or not, and it's also not a metaphysical statement in the style of "God does not exist" that you just "agree" with or not.

    You gauge how much you have understood *anattā* not by your intellectual understanding of fancy ideas, nor the attainment of mystical experiences through meditation, but by reflecting on how deeply you'd suffer if you lost the things that are dear to you (or failed to acquire them in the first place).

    The degree of suffering that arises there is the amount of control that is assumed over the aggregates, and thus the degree to which a self, in the sense of a master of the experience, is still assumed. Whether you then "believe" that "in ultimate reality there is no self" is irrelevant.

### I am new to Buddhism and have watched a few videos by Hillside Hermitage, I don't get what the problem is with Orthodox or mainstream Therevada 



- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1avup7i/i_am_new_to_buddhism_and_have_watched_a_few/krgbugp/)** _2024-02-21 14:33:57_:

    "The problem" is not mainly some specific point of doctrine; it's the fact that people's spiritual practice in general, whether it be mainstream Theravada or anything else, hinges unwittingly on ignoring or covering up one's liability to suffering—in various ways ranging from simple to elaborate, and which may or may not have any common ground superficially—in order to achieve freedom from suffering, whereas the genuine Dhamma is about confronting your liability and uprooting it, so that there remains nothing at all that *could* make you suffer but which you didn't acknowledge so as to feel relief as soon as possible.

    Therefore, the liberation that lies at the end of mainstream approaches is such that some things *could* still make one who reaches it crave and suffer, hence it's not true liberation. Peace would be there only for as long as one happens not to experience those things, no matter how unlikely and distant they are.

    Edit: All specific disagreements in doctrine are a consequence of this fundamental difference.

### Upadana and Knowledge outside of the five aggregates?

So one experiences a feeling and the mind's automatic reaction to get rid of it or want more of it.

If one chooses to act out of this automatic intention by body, speech or mind because one thinks of these intentions as mine (upadana), isn't think process also expressed as a sankhara (mental activity)? Thus making it also within the five aggregates?

Also side question: can knowledge of the characteristics of the five aggregates can also been seen as the absense of upadana?

Thanks in advance

    >If one chooses to act out of this automatic intention by body, speech or mind because one thinks of these intentions as mine (upadana), isn't think process also expressed as a sankhara (mental activity)? Thus making it also within the five aggregates?

    Yes, the saṅkhāras that are there when avijjā is there are saṅkhāras (\*"\*with ignorance as condition, activities"). But you can't characterize that as "thinking processes" because that implies a person can just decide to become aware of them and remove them, whereas those things are there *because* you can't see them even when you try; that's what ignorance is. Ignorance means *not knowing,* not just "forgetting to check". That's why it's a massive contradiction when people think that they first "catch" their defilements and then "let go" of them by doing this or that.

    There is no interval between recognizing upādana or craving correctly and giving them up.

    >can knowledge of the characteristics of the five aggregates can also been seen as the absense of upadana?

    Therefore, yes.

    Upādāna is the lack of knowledge of the upādāna-aggregates, and absence of upādāna is knowledge of the upādāna-aggregates, which means there are no upādāna-aggregates anymore.

    Point being, you can't know upādāna *as* upādāna and still have it.

>  
>*AN 4.199, Ven. Thanissaro*

I used to think I gave up gossiping and coarse forms of discussion of other people, what they do, why they do what they do, and so on. But I realized that wasn't the case today and also found out that I'm almost like a zombie mindlessly talking without any particular reason; it's like that image of a donkey with a carrot in front of it: it'll just pursue it mindlessly, thinking that by moving in that direction it'll *eventually* end up getting what it wants, but never *actually* getting it. There's just some vague ambiguous goal of "perfected pleasure" (the carrot) that I'm seeking, which I never actually reach; my verbalization is a manifestation of this. It's just constant useless blabbering.

Perhaps this is the nature of craving as a whole, but it just became clear as day to me right now, and only in the instance of speech. Perhaps the whole notion of "moving with the grain" is just this constant mindlessness and zombie-like behavior?

But more specifically, when I analyze my speech (internal & external), it's entirely composed of "I" or "others"; the *exact* same permutations mentioned in the sutta above. More precisely, the locus here is "I" against which there are "others"; every discussion of how others are, are not, is related to how I am, or am not. So the fundamental basis for this verbalization is as the sutta points out, the notion of "I am". Even right now, I have a tendency to unnecessarily provide details and examples about **me**.

My reason for restraining this currently is simply because it's unnecessary. But I wish to know what the sutta means here so that I can reflect on a better reason. It seems to be positing some relationship between craving and conceit, and I've never been able to understand this relationship. I understand (theoretically) the relationship between craving and the sense of "mine", but what does craving have to do with "me or I am"? Why are those verbalizations particularly *craving*\-verbalizations? It seems to imply that the removal of craving would also annihilate such manners of thinking; why? What is the danger in regarding something as "me" or thinking in terms of the various permutations of "I am"?

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1av8m05/reflection_on_conceit_and_speech/krbe2nx/)** _2024-02-20 17:05:20_:

    The Pāli is *taṇhāvicarita*, which means literally "craving-roaming" or "craving-wandering", not "craving-verbalization".

    What's being referred to here is the *context* behind your thinking, whether or not you ever verbalize the words "I" or "mine". Having such contexts present more strongly might *result* in a person talking about themselves a lot, but that would be one of the many secondary symptoms of appropriation that can be superficially managed and suppressed; it's not the illness itself.

    These tendencies can only be overcome if one has recognized the sense of self as a phenomenon rightly and learned to put it second, which makes there be no need to micromanage your speech. You would naturally talk less about yourself without actively trying, while still freely using the words "I" and "mine" when necessary, and without any of these permutations of craving being there.

    One cannot simply choose to not regard things as self, because it will result in the "seeing not-self with self" that MN 2 refers to. As the Sutta implies, these ways of thinking are there because craving is there. If you deal with that (by first understanding what craving actually is), you pull out the actual root of it all, whereas if you just cut the branches by squashing and "antidoting" every sense of "I" or "mine" you become aware of, the root remains intact, and there will be appropriation in one of these 18 permutations as the overlooked context to that whole tactic.

### Yoniso manasikara

I’ve been listening closely and repeatedly to the below video trying to gain a better understanding of overcoming defilements with proper yoniso manasikara coupled with another’s utterance. Some what understandable when using the examples for the defilement of lust. But one of my main issues is the defilement of worry. So in the case of worry, would the proper attention to the root or womb be ignorance? Example (worry about job) or (worry about family issues) The womb in these instances being ingnorance in ownership or misappropriating things out of my control such as situations at a job or dealing with family. Or in other words I’m ignorant in thinking I can own or change bad situations and thus ignorance leads to the sankhara of ownership? Am I on the right track here? Thank you Dhamma family

Or in other words I’m ignorant in thinking I can own or change bad situations and thus ignorance leads to the sankhara of ownership? Am I on the right track here?

    Well, as always, the first "root" or "womb" that you need to start investigating is your lifestyle. You can be trying to figure out how to attend to things correctly and whatnot, but fundamentally if you are still in coarse ways maintaining the dependence of your well-being on not only your own body and mind, but on sense pleasures and external possessions, then you can't be surprised if a lot of worries arise and you get overwhelmed by them, because as the Buddha said, where there is desire there will be acquisition, and with acquisition comes the need to protect. You could then find clever ways to cover up the worry, but the *liability* to worry will still be there for as long as desires are acted out of.

    There's only so much intensity of worry (and hindrances in general) that you can properly surmount and learn to be unaffected by without covering it up, and you will have more than that much if you don't keep the 8 precepts.

    Having said that, you can't really see ignorance as "the womb" directly, because ignorance can never be something you're concretely aware of. It's by definition beyond your immediate reach.

    Instead, while the worries are there, you need to find a reference point that allows you to maintain perspective and not be going "with the grain" of the worry, but without ending up suppressing it and replacing it with something else entirely. For example, knowing that while you're worried, you're feeling displeasure, or while you're worried, your body is there, liable to sickness, aging, and death.

    That's all there is to it, and the failure to do it properly is in the fact that the mind will be veering either towards not recognizing the context clearly enough, or emphasizing the context too much and losing sight of the whole situation and pressure to which that context applies, which makes it not be a context any longer and defeats the whole purpose. You don't need to "resolve" the hindrance which is what most people would be trying to do; you simply need to keep perspective in face of it.

    When the context has been sustained properly long enough, then whatever you where thinking will not be a "worry" anymore, even if it's the same thing. That's because the worry (and the suffering) was not *in those thoughts*, but in your mind jumping into them head-on, so to speak. That becomes impossible if the context is clear and stable to the point where it's impossible to forget it even if you make no effort to recollect it.

    Also, it's not about *constantly* attending to it as you would in a meditation technique. You only have to "refresh" it once you notice your mind actually *giving in* to the worry or whatever it may be. You don't lose the context *because* the hindrance is there, but because you act out of the hindrance, even by mind.

### What did the householders in the Buddha's time see to want to go into the homeless life?

The suttas and vinaya are filled with householders realizing some inherent danger in remaining as a layperson and it appears that that danger is so much that it overrides all their responsibilities. I can imagine an only son leaving his family to ordain being a significant threat to that family's well-being considering Indian societies are structured around their kids providing full support to their parents which is the case even today.

This is also my only obstacle towards ordination. Leaving my parents without properly fulfilling my duties to them feels like the biggest possible betrayal one could partake in to me. It's incomprehensible to me what kind of danger the people in suttas saw that it completely overrode this sense of duty that must've *also* been there for them and most likely in an ever more pressuring sense.

Like I remember reading a biography in *Great Disciples of the Buddha* regarding a monk who'd apparently seen worms die in a field and that was enough to arouse enough sense of urgency in him to ordain? First of all, is this even realistic? Secondly, if so, what is the danger that that monk must've seen to then want to ordain? And lastly, why is there such difference between now and then? Is this a difference in time or between individual tendencies, both, neither?

I do recall there being a sutta that differentiated between the individuals whose sense of urgency is aroused on account of hearing of sickness, old age and death, then individuals who have it aroused on account of seeing, and experiencing it themselves. But what quality is responsible for these varying discernments into the danger of remaining a lay person?

For context, I managed to find the relevant excerpts from the book and it turns out that that's apparently the backstory of Ven. Mahakassapa (named Pipphali as a layperson):

>He was named Pipphali. His father owned sixteen villages over which he ruled like a little king, so Pipphali grew up in the midst of wealth and luxury. Yet already in his youth he felt a longing to leave the worldly life behind and hence he did not want to marry. When his parents repeatedly urged him to take a wife, he told them that he would look after them as long as they lived but that after their deaths he would become an ascetic. Yet they insisted again and again that he should take a wife, and thus just to comfort his mother he finally agreed to marry—on the condition that a girl could be found who conformed to his idea of perfection.  
>  
>For that purpose he commissioned goldsmiths to fashion for him a golden statue of a beautiful maiden. He had it bedecked with fine garments and ornaments and showed it to his parents, saying: “If you can find a maiden like this for me, I shall remain in the home life.” But his mother was a clever woman and thought: “Surely my son must have done deeds of merit in the past, and he must have done them together with a woman who is the counterpart of this golden image.” Thus she approached eight brahmins, showered them with rich gifts, and asked them to take the image and travel around in search of a human likeness of it. The brahmins thought: “Let us first go to the Madda country, which is a gold mine of beautiful women.” There they found at Sāgala a girl whose beauty equalled that of the image. She was Bhaddā Kapilānī, a wealthy brahmin’s daughter, age sixteen, four years younger than Pipphali Kassapa. Her parents agreed to the marriage proposal, and the brahmins returned to tell of their success.  
>  
>Yet Bhaddā Kapilānī too did not wish to marry. Like Pipphali, she longed to live a religious life and wished to leave home as a female ascetic. Such correspondence between her aspiration and that of Pipphali was not due to chance but sprang from the strong kammic bond they had forged in previous lives. Maturing in the present life, this bond was to unite them in marriage in their youth and to lead to a decisive separation later on—a separation which was again to be resolved by a union at a still higher level, when both consummated their spiritual endeavours by winning the supreme fruit of holiness under the Enlightened One.  
>  
>Pipphali was most distressed to hear that his plot had been foiled and that his parents had actually found a girl who matched the golden statue. Still intent on escaping from his agreement, he sent the following letter to the girl: “Bhaddā, please marry someone else of equal status and live a happy home life with him. As for myself, I shall become an ascetic. Please do not have regrets.” Bhaddā Kapilānī, likeminded as she was, independently sent him a similar letter. But their parents, suspecting such an exchange would take place, had both letters intercepted on the way and replaced by letters of welcome.  
>  
>So Bhaddā was taken to Magadha and the young couple were married. However, in accordance with their ascetic yearning, both agreed to maintain a life of celibacy. To give expression to their decision, each night they would lay a garland of flowers between them before they went to bed, resolving, “If on either side the flowers wilt, we shall understand that the person on whose side they wilted had given rise to a lustful thought.” At night they lay awake all night long from fear of making bodily contact; during the day they did not even smile at one another. As long as their parents lived they remained aloof from worldly enjoyment, and they did not even have to look after the estate’s farms.  
>  
>When Pipphali’s parents died, the couple took charge of the large property. **It was then that they felt the spur that set them on the course of renunciation**. One day, as Pipphali was inspecting the fields, he saw as if with new eyes something that he had seen so often before. **He observed that when his farm hands ploughed the land, many birds gathered and eagerly picked the worms from the furrows. This sight, so common to a farmer, now startled him. It struck him forcefully that what brought him his wealth, the produce of his fields, was bound up with the suffering of other living beings**. His livelihood was purchased with the death of so many worms and other little creatures living in the soil. Thinking about this, he asked one of his laborers: “Who will have to bear the consequences of such an evil action?”  
>  
>“You yourself, sir,” was the answer  
>  
>Shaken by that insight into kammic retribution, Pipphali went home and reflected: “If I have to carry along the burden of guilt for this killing, of what use to me is all my wealth? I would be better off giving it all to Bhaddā and going forth into the ascetic life.”  
>  
>But at home, at about the same time, **Bhaddā had a similar experience**, seeing afresh with a deeper understanding something she had very often seen before. Her servants had spread out sesamum seeds to dry in the sun, and crows and other birds ate the insects that had been attracted by the seeds. When Bhaddā asked her servants who had to account morally for the violent death of so many creatures, she was told that the kammic responsibility was hers. Then she thought: “If even by this much I commit evil, I won’t be able to lift my head above the ocean of rebirths even in a thousand lives. As soon as Pipphali returns, I shall hand over everything to him and leave to take up the ascetic life.”  
>  
>*Great Disciplies of the Buddha, p. 105*

So it seems that their families were both quite wealthy and so that sense of duty must've not been so heavy even though it was still likely there, but it seemed to have not bothered either one considering they were both quite intent on renunciation from a fairly young age (16, and 20). I understand inherently wanting to remain celibate, not get married, not inclining towards proliferation of sexual desires, wanting them to lessen, not being passioned with regards to the world. However, the rest of the story seems odd.

It seems that it wasn't because of the death of the animals that they'd gone forth but rather some understanding into the metaphysical notions of karma that also don't seem to fair up well with my own understanding currently. For instance, why are they ones who'll have to "bear the consequences for such evil actions" when that's not even something they've intended?

However, the general point still remains that there seems to be some danger seen in remaining as a layperson throughout all the people who wish to go into homelessness that apparently I cannot see. But if such a danger does in fact exist, then I would like to see it.

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1aropkz/what_did_the_householders_in_the_buddhas_time_see/kqteys6/)** _2024-02-17 09:47:16_:

    It's not like you're missing some piece of information that will reveal you the danger. The mind fails to see things as they are not because it hasn't been *told* the way they are, which is certainly necessary, but because of its own defilements that haven't been cleared up.

    Some people's starting point might naturally be less cluttered with obstructions, and that is why some people would without even needing a lot of instruction, incline towards renunciation just by hearing about the misfortunes of someone else (AN 4.113).

    (The story about Mahā Kassapa is commentarial and thus most likely fictitious).

    The only way to clear up these obstructions is as always adherence to the gradual training. There is some possibility, depending on whether you're wearing away things properly or not, that the danger that you already know intellectually would one day become apparent enough to push you to ordain.

    But waiting for that is always a risky choice, because nobody has an outside view of their own situation, and it's impossible to be sure that the way you are practicing and living now is genuinely training your mind properly except in hindsight. It is perfectly possible that taking the plunge and ordaining is exactly the push that would help you to take on the practice on the right level, which you (unwittingly) may not have been doing before, or it could also be that you would eventually see the danger just by practicing in your current environment, but after so long that by the time you felt inspired to go forth, it would be too late—assuming you live that long, to begin with.

    Choosing to maintain the status quo until something magically changes is always unwise; at the very least you should be striving further in renunciation whether or not you ordain. Renunciation is also a gamble from one's initial point of view affected by ignorance, but the difference is that even if you don't "win", the only loss it can result in is only worldly and transient, no matter how much it hurts.

### Resistance is suffering

Hello, I'm looking for some clarifications about tanha and assumption of sensuality.

In Ajahn Nyanamoli's book I found this passage on the assumption of sensuality:

&#x200B;

>**The Only Way to Jhana - Chapter 4 : Desire to end desire**  
>  
>Taṇhā is more on an immediate level of your attitude towards your present enduring feeling, whatever it is. That attitude is always rooted in resistance. Even if there is craving for pleasure, that is rooted in you resisting the current feeling, which is not in itself unpleasant, but it’s not sufficient—the pleasure is not sufficient, which is why you crave for more pleasure—which means, it’s painful.  
>  
>Any resistance is painful, and with the mind of resistance, if you experience pleasure, you will be resisting it by default, because by default, you want more of it. With the mind not free from taṇhā, when you experience pain, you’re resisting it by default, because you don’t want any of it. You want it to completely go away. With the mind not free from taṇhā, when you experience a neutral feeling, you will automatically resist it, you will incline towards oblivion, towards ignoring it, towards turning away from it, because you don’t understand it. Taṇhā, practically speaking, is always that resistance on the level of what you’re currently feeling.  
>  
>Q: Even if you’re feeling pleasure, you’re still resisting it. It’s not good enough for you.  
>  
>Nm: Absolutely. That’s why if you’re not free from craving, every pleasure will be underlain by craving for more. With the presence of resistance, there is the presence of dissatisfaction. Presence of taṇhā means dukkha is there, presence of dukkha means taṇhā is there.  
>  
>If taṇhā is still present, that means that there is still resistance to whatever feeling is there for you at the time, and that’s why you suffer: not because of what is felt, but because of that resistance. And why would you be resisting? Why is it that you’re not content with an agreeable feeling that is present? Why is it, that by default, the mind wants more of it? It’s because of the wrong view in regard to what pleasure is, what sensuality is, and what gratification is.  
>  
>Sensuality is a form of upādāna, an assumption. It’s basically the view and the values that you uphold throughout your day-to-day existence. Sensual desire is felt unpleasantly and that’s why you want to gratify your senses, because non-gratified senses hurt. However, your resistance is the suffering there, and so if you stop resisting the non-gratified senses, they’ll stop hurting and there will be no suffering there despite the senses being ungratified. But when you don’t see that the suffering is on the level of your resistance, you think suffering exists because of the non-gratification of the senses, and so you go out and seek gratification, and that’s why you keep perpetuating your suffering.  
>  
>So first, you need to stop seeking out the gratification of the senses, so that your resistance to the non-gratified senses becomes apparent as the cause of your suffering. Only then can you realise, ‘Oh, I stop resisting, it stops hurting’. Which means that gratifying the senses becomes redundant. The habit of resistance (craving) perpetuates the sensuality view that non-gratified senses cause suffering and gratified senses means freedom from suffering.

>Taṇhā feeds kāmupādāna—the assumption of sense desire, and the kāmupādāna feeds taṇhā. It’s a vicious circle, it has no beginning. It’s not that you were pure, then you develop taṇhā, and then you develop upādāna. No, you start already infected, perverted, mistaken, confused, assumed. Corruption is beginningless. And that’s why if you understand it, if you uproot the gratuitous assumption or the craving, both will be uprooted and cannot revert back. That uprooting is irreversible.

&#x200B;

I'm really just looking for confirmation or correction, could anyone please tell me if my understanding is correct or if anything is missing or misinterpreted please?

&#x200B;

**Sensual desire in regard to feeling** : resistance to the current feeling that add a layer of suffering on top of the current feeling because the ~~sense~~ mind wants to have what it doesn't have (either more pleasantness or less unpleasatness)

**Pleasant feeling** : resistance towards it because wants more of it

**Unpleasant feeling** : resistance towards it because don't want it

**Neutral feeling** : resistance towards it because don't want it (don't understand it)

&#x200B;

So roughly speaking are these the steps to see the way out of kamupadana and eventually free oneself from tanha all together after refinement?

1. Any contact is there accompanied with feeling, there is sensual desire in regard to this feeling, meaning resistance to it
2. Resistance to the feeling hurts so want to gratify the sense so it doesn't hurt anymore
3. Stop resisting the feeling and it will stop it hurting so there is no need to gratify it anymore
4. We are left with only the current feeling

    >So roughly speaking are these the steps to see the way out of kamupadana and eventually free oneself from tanha all together after refinement?

    Yes, but point #3 is where the vast majority of the work lies. Learning how to stop resisting feelings without that turning into a subliminal attempt to get rid of them is what takes a long time.

### Hello

Hello,

I recently discovered this community, I have gone through many of the posts here and other forums and many videos on the youtube channel as well, just tried proper sense restraint for past few days and I am convinced.

My main question is, since developing the right view involves a lot of critical analysis, the "peripheral view" of different kinds of sensuality whilst staying present with whatever comes up (forgive me for my simplistic and maybe erroneous reduction), if a person is not intelligent enough to properly do the critical analysis, how can one bring one's abilities to that level, is that possible, if so how can I do it? I will start going through all of the HH youtube videos carefully, start reading the suttas , Ajahn Nyanamoli's books/ essays, but would appreciate any other tips. Thank you!

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1aq4cz4/hello/kqctz2w/)** _2024-02-14 07:20:45_:

    Not being *as* able to perform what you call the "critical analysis" and not being able to wrap one's head about all the theoretical nuances is not the central obstacle on the path.

    The only true insurmountable obstacles on the path are: 1) Trivializing/underestimating avijjā and the Dhamma 2) Lack of renunciation, virtue and sense restraint.

    In order to not fall into #1, all one has to do is regard the idea that one is already partaking in even one of the factors of the Noble Eightfold Path as to good to be true. That will ensure that, despite inevitably still having certain misunderstandings, one will at least not be *cultivating* them by failing to be sufficiently skeptical towards one's own practice., and failing to treat the Dhamma with due respect.

    This is the reason for our continuous insistence on how there is no right meditation or understanding before one becomes a sotāpanna. Anything less than that attitude entails an unrealistic assessment of one's predicament of being immersed in ignorance, not realizing the sheer magnitude of it.

    As regards point #2, people's idea that they can practice the Dhamma without actually abandoning the actions that go against it is a result of point #1, but it's still worth a separate mention.

    If a person relentlessly makes sure to avoid those two pitfalls, they would realize the essence of all the more detailed and intellectually challenging stuff we teach eventually with only the Suttas as their guide. People back in the Buddha's day didn't have a tendency (or much less at least) for either of these two things, which is why so many of them realized the Dhamma without the need for so many technicalities.

    It's also how there are "faith types" who achieve enlightenment through faith. It's those people that go so intensely in the opposite direction of these two pitfalls that they can do without as much intellectual aid. "Faith" is not about a feel-good sense of blind devotion and admiration that has no direct bearing on your actions.

### Overcoming drowsiness and dullness?

Hi all, just want to ask for opinion regarding dealing with drowsiness and dullness.  


>SN 46.53  (I'm quoting parts from the sutta)  
>  
>When the mind is sluggish, it’s the right time to develop the awakening factors of investigation of principles, energy, and rapture. Why is that? Because it’s easy to stimulate a sluggish mind with these things.   
>  
>When the mind is restless, it’s the right time to develop the awakening factors of tranquility, immersion, and equanimity. Why is that? Because it’s easy to settle a restless mind with these things.  

What does it mean by developing the awakening factors of principles, energy and rapture when the mind is sluggish? Likewise for when the mind is restless?   

How does one stimulate the sluggish mind with principles, energy and rapture?  

How does one settle the restless mind with tranquility, immersion and equanimity?  

Does this investigation happens in sequence? 

i.e  

investigation of principle -> energy -> rapture 

developing tranquility -> immersion -> equanimity 

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1aovr9j/overcoming_drowsiness_and_dullness/kq9ehb2/)** _2024-02-13 17:38:15_:

    To add to what SDCjp wrote, the awakening factors do not exist before stream-entry (SN 46.30) The very first factor, sati, is about recollecting one's right understanding. If one doesn't have it to begin with, one cannot recollect it.

    Besides that, the same principle applies to dullness and drowsiness as to all other hindrances: the hindrances are simply 5 manifestations of one's overall impulse to act on account of what's felt. So whatever one does to overcome a hindrance, it must not be operating under the same principle of wanting to get rid of whatever feeling is there, in this case the displeasure of a dull mind, no matter if in theory "dullness bad". It isn't in itself, just like any other mental state. What's bad is when you *act*, even mentally, out of the pressure of a mental state. Sāriputta for example became an Arahant by [knowing "sluggish mind" as "sluggish mind"](https://suttacentral.net/an7.39/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=sidebyside&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin), not by *doing* something to get rid of it. "Knowing it" means you are aware of it's presence to the extent that neither succumb to it, nor do you overshoot it and act as if you're entitled to control the arising of pressure (SN 1.1)

    If you try to get rid of any hindrance directly, what will always happen is you will end up feeding another hindrance in the process (trying to get rid of sensuality directly, people do asubha with aversion; trying to get rid of ill-will directly, people do mettā with longing and attachment; trying to get rid of sloth and torpor, people feed restlessness, etc.). There will always be a subtler hindrance motivating any such attempts.

    (Edit: If you're full on nodding, it's perfectly fine to get up and walk. Also, you shouldn't be meditating with eyes closed. That's almost a one-way ticket to wrong samādhi).

### Metta abandons only ill will ?

I had some doubts about metta practice from one of  u/Bhikkhu_Anigha's comment on another post.

&#x200B;

>The sole purpose of practicing *mettā*, which is the foundation upon which the next 3 are built, is to [abandon ill-will ](https://suttacentral.net/an6.13/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin)

Is metta a practice just to overcome ill will? That makes no sense to me, How is it possible to overcome ill will without simultaneously overcoming sensuality? I know the approach to both practices are different and the themes you contemplate also vary but shouldn't diminishing ill will also diminish sensuality?

>They are able to "witness with the body" the cessation of a defilement

Does defilement here mean hindrance or something else? When you stop taking up hindrances and start seeing them arise at the level of the body, This vision applies to all hindrances, Either your mind is subjected to all the hindrances or it isnt subjected to any of them (pls correct me if i said something inaccurate). So When you "witness with the body the cessation of a defilement", I suppose this is to mean something other than "not taking up the hindrance of ill will and thus all hindrances" because these hindrances can rearise if you "loose" mindfulness. So, does "cessation of the defilement" mean the recognition that the hindrance of ill will has permanently subsided and can never reappear again even if you get distracted from your establishment of metta and no circumstance or loosing mindfulness can reintroduce ill-will back into your experience. If so, is it possible to be permanently free from one hindrance and be subjected to the rest?? I'm very confused about this part.

This excerpt is from the suttas.

>Take another mendicant who says: ‘I’ve developed the heart’s release by equanimity. I’ve cultivated it, made it my vehicle and my basis, kept it up, consolidated it, and properly implemented it. Yet somehow desire still occupies my mind.’ They should be told, ‘Not so, venerable! … For it is the heart’s release by equanimity that is the escape from desire.’

Does desire here mean sensual desire? When practicing brahmaviharas, does one have to develop their mind all the way to equanimity to be free from sensual desire? if so, Why is that? I cant see how one does not abandon sensuality alongside ill will.

Also is ill will and sensuality abandoned immediately by someone with the right view after establishing mind on metta or jhana and thus becoming anagami or is that a gradual turning away of the mind? Also, do you have to do further contemplations on the disgust of sensuality or the peril of ill will in order to free yourself once after you've established your mind on this greater context or is this process automatic?

Sorry to bother you with so many questions. This has been bugging me for a while

    >Is metta a practice just to overcome ill will? That makes no sense to me, How is it possible to overcome ill will without simultaneously overcoming sensuality? I know the approach to both practices are different and the themes you contemplate also vary but shouldn't diminishing ill will also diminish sensuality?

    I was not implying that mettā is some sort of direct "antidote" to ***ill-will only*** as people tend to understand it. mettā overcomes all the 5 hindrances, and all craving entirely if paired with Right View. What I meant with "sole purpose" is that the goal of mettā is not give rise to *pleasure* as people would think, but to train the mind to be unmoved by the displeasure that other people might generate. Being moved by that displeasure *is* what ill-will is.

    The usual way of practicing mettā is actually just another way of being moved by that displeasure, such that you feel the need to jump into feeling *affection* for the person instead so that the displeasure gets covered up. This is in its essence the same principle as sensuality: you can't endure the displeasure of not seeing, hearing, tasting, smelling or touching some object that is pulling your senses, and so you jump the get the pleasure of that object to distract you from the more fundamental discomfort of the senses being attacked by things beyond your control.

    Hence, mettā done rightly removes *all* tendencies for sense desire too. Mettā as generally practiced not only fails to address them—it's *driven* by those same underlying tendencies.

    >So, does "cessation of the defilement" mean the recognition that the hindrance of ill will has permanently subsided and can never reappear again even if you get distracted from your establishment of metta and no circumstance or loosing mindfulness can reintroduce ill-will back into your experience. If so, is it possible to be permanently free from one hindrance and be subjected to the rest?? I'm very confused about this part.

    In the context where I wrote that (certain ascetics who fully developed mettā outside the Buddha's dispensation), yes, it was a permanent abandonment of ill-will (and a permanent abandonment of sensuality by definition too). A puthujjana can be free from sensuality, which means they can also be free from ill-will.

    >If so, is it possible to be permanently free from one hindrance and be subjected to the rest?? I'm very confused about this part.

    So no, in that case they would've been freed from the other hindrances too. But they were still puthujjanas, so the fundamental level of ignorance remained. So as the Suttas say, they would be reborn in the same plane as an anāgami, but eventually after many eons they would fall back down into the sensual or lower realms. But of course, they would've become anāgāmis almost instantaneously if they'd heard the Dhamma, just like the Buddha's former teachers, but they never did.

    >Does desire here mean sensual desire? When practicing brahmaviharas, does one have to develop their mind all the way to equanimity to be free from sensual desire? if so, Why is that? I cant see how one does not abandon sensuality alongside ill will.

    No, that's a mistranslation. The word is *rāga* which is "passion". What remains when the first three brahmavihāras have been developed is a subtle residue of passion (more on the level of the passion for form or the formless that an anāgāmi still has, not *sensual* passion). That's what's abandoned through the final abiding of upekkhā. Sensuality would've already fallen away long before, through the very first brahmavihāra which is mettā.

    >Also is ill will and sensuality abandoned immediately by someone with the right view after establishing mind on metta or jhana and thus becoming anagami or is that a gradual turning away of the mind?

    Yes and no. As per AN 3.94, a sotāpanna who dies while the mind is free from hindrances would essentially die as an anāgāmi. But unless that happens, they are liable to fall back from that and be affected by sensuality and ill will at some point again. Repeated abiding in samādhi would be necessary to make the abandonment permanent.

    >Also, do you have to do further contemplations on the disgust of sensuality or the peril of ill will in order to free yourself once after you've established your mind on this greater context or is this process automatic?

    Those contemplations *are* what would establish the mind on that greater context and strengthen it once it's already there. That's what it means to "steady your mind" in jhāna and "make much of it" for example: clarify the danger of sensuality even more by reflecting on it, which indirectly increases the wholesome joy of withdrawal. It doesn't mean "get *absorbed on this object* even more".

### How to understand MN20 in relation to ‘Sīla is Samādhi’?

I’m having some trouble reconciling two teachings, hopefully you can help. In the ’Removal of distracting thoughts’ MN20, the Buddha teaches 5 methods to remove unskilful thoughts. He says…  


>When evil unskillful thoughts connected with desire, hate, and delusion arise in a bhikkhu through reflection on an adventitious object, he should, (in order to get rid of that), reflect on a different object which is connected with skill. Then the evil unskillful thoughts are eliminated; they disappear. By their elimination, the mind stands firm, settles down, becomes unified and concentrated  
>  
>getting rid of a coarse peg with a fine one

Then the other 4 methods: seeing danger, ignoring, stilling thought formation, ‘crushing mind with mind’.  


This seems to go against the idea of enduring unwelcome thoughts as taught in the essay ‘[Sīla is Samdhi](https://www.hillsidehermitage.org/sila-is-samadhi/)’. As reflected in the following passages:  


>…thoughts in the form of desires, annoyances, boredom/laziness, anxieties and doubts about various issues will inevitably come to the foreground of attention, …start trying to see how a different route than the usual two extremes that one is used to (indulgence and denial) could in fact be taken towards those mental states.  
>  
>it is one’s ***volitional lust***, one’s *deliberate choice to accept* the presented possibilities to try to “release” the mental pressure that is the problem  
>  
>It must be emphasized that the purpose of this contemplation of danger is not to get rid of the arisen *thought*, but to address one’s inability to remain *internally* unmoved by its alluring nature  
>  
>in the above Sutta, the man simply *refrains* from doing what would cause the lamp to burn longer than it should on its own. He doesn’t *manually* try to get the oil out or put out the fire. This is the only way to abandon an unwholesome state without generating another.  
>  
>you always *touched* the trap either to eat the bait or to throw it away, and that’s all the hunter needed to get you. But now, you are learning to not *take* the bait, nor try to *remove* it either

Initially I thought the Buddha could be referring to the removal of the 3 poisons, which would make sense with ‘not touching the bait’ of the thoughts. But that can’t be so as it distinctly says evil, unwholesome thoughts (connected with 3 poisons desire, hate, delusion), which is the same phrase used in the formula on sense restraint, (that without samvara such states would assail you), but in that case it is dhamma rather than vittaka.  


Many thanks to Bhikkhu Anigha for writing this essay, I feel like it will be a massive help in my practice. Best wishes.

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1amu2uw/how_to_understand_mn20_in_relation_to_sīla_is/kpqvdix/)** _2024-02-10 05:26:09_:

    The confusion is rooted in an extremely common (including by translators) careless reading of the relevant passages, paired with a confirmation bias in favor of meditation techniques.

    >*Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno* ***yaṁ nimittaṁ āgamma*** *yaṁ nimittaṁ manasikaroto uppajjanti pāpakā akusalā vitakkā chandūpasaṁhitāpi dosūpasaṁhitāpi mohūpasaṁhitāpi, tena, bhikkhave, bhikkhunā tamhā nimittā aññaṁ nimittaṁ manasi kātabbaṁ kusalūpasaṁhitaṁ.* 

    >Take a bhikkhu who is attending to some ***sign*** that gives rise to harmful, unfavorable thoughts connected with desire, aversion, and muddledness. That bhikkhu should attend to a different ***sign*** connected with what's favorable.

    The Buddha also gives a simile:

    > Just as a skilled carpenter or his apprentice might knock out, remove, and **extract a coarse peg by means of a fine one,** so too…when a bhikkhu gives attention to some other sign connected with what is wholesome…his mind becomes steadied internally, quieted, brought to singleness, and concentrated.

    This is not saying that you should attend to a different *dhamma*/*vitakka,* which is what people interpret it as ("focus the mind on a *different* *object").* The word is *nimitta*, which absolutely does not mean "object", nor even "thought" or "mental image".

    SN 47.8 describes how a monk who cannot grasp the *nimitta* of his mind is unable to abandon the defilements. This is a a slightly  different context but the meaning of the word is the same. You cannot grasp the "object" of your mind, that's preposterous. What it's talking about, to put it simply, is noticing the *attitude* that your mind harbors towards this or that object, which is where the defilements are. It compares the monk who is able to notice that attitude with a cook who catches the subtle *signs* that reveal the king's predilection for certain dishes. The whole point is that those *nimittas* are not observable *objects* of perception, in which case there would be no possibility for the cook not to catch them unless he were blind, and the Buddha would've chosen a different simile.

    The *nimittas* that MN 20 refers to are on exactly the same level; it's certain attitudes that the mind holds towards this or that thing which is feeding the unwholesome thoughts. So only by first recognizing that attitude would one be able to "replace" it with an attitude connected with the wholesome. Replacing one *object* with another does nothing to the attitude, which is why it will remain the same. Also, notice that the simile is replacing one coarse peg with a finer, not replacing a coarse peg with *another* coarse peg, which is what happens when you simply switch to another object.

    Essentially, this is why meditation techniques are "meditation with sensuality". Because one cannot catch those *nimittas* of one's own attitude and can only cover up the underlying craving by attending to different *object*, the attitude of sensuality and the hindrances as a whole remain there. This is what AN 11.9 refers to with "harboring sensuality ***internally***, he meditates...."

    The main takeaway is that one needs to be willing to admit that one doesn't even know what craving and defilements are in order to do the work of uncovering these "signs", instead of conveniently assuming that by switching the object of attention, which even the most untrained, ignorant beginner could understand, the problem is solved. The purpose behind the Gradual Training is to contain the outpours of one's defilements so that gradually the signs of those defilements can become more and more apparent. It's by definition not something that the average person can even relate to, and is the primary reason why one wouldn't see the Four Noble Truths—insufficient recognition of the signs of the mind.

    It's because of this that MN 2 starts off by saying that the abandonment of defilements is "only for one who knows and sees", and not simply for one who can replace one object with another, i.e., everyone. These 5 strategies in MN 20 are in fact not even addressed to a puthujjana, because it talks about "one devoted to the higher mind", which would have to be a sotāpanna at least—precisely one who can grasp the signs of their mind. A puthujjana first needs to see clearly what desire, aversion, and delusion are in the first place, thereby getting the Right View, before they can properly implement these 5 strategies.

    (Edit: Another problem with the idea of "switching the object" is that it would only be applicable when you're sitting in "formal meditation", whereas what the Buddha is referring to here is the urgent task that can and should be carried out *at any time*, "as if one's head were on fire" as other Suttas say).

    In this context, as a *prerequisite* for going in to solitude, it would simply mean that one should have reached the point where breaking the 8 precepts takes more effort than keeping them.

    Solitude and seeing the signs of the mind on the basis of that would eventually result in the ["accomplishment in virtue"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLRRaga5a2s), which is the Right View (the ability to be virtuous without *sīlabbataparamāsa).*

### Do you think going forth is the best possible way to train the mind?

Hello, I was wondering about one point and since I have no experience in the matter, I'm curious what people that possibly have some experience might think about it.

&#x200B;

Do you think going forth and ordaining is the best way to put all the odds in your favor when it comes to train to become a sotapanna or anagami?

&#x200B;

The reason I'm wondering is that I realized that in my daily living I encounter plenty of agreeable and disagreeable sense-objects in the society on which I have no control and that can allow me to endure the discomfort from the pressure and not delight in the perspective of getting rid of it.

I'm bombarded with pressurable things, the mind is pushed left and right, while on the other hand, I imagine the life of a bhikkhu (but I might be wrong, after all I don't know what's it is like at all) to be less stressful on the level of encountering all these sense-objects, being surrounded by people wanting to live peacefully, also people that are more likely to be easy to live with because more restrained that those we can encounter in the world, and so all-in-all possibly being a less pressuring context, or maybe at least pressuring at first because of not getting used to so much austerity, but once one get used to it I feel like it could be possible to fall into a sort of "complacency" by not being pressured enough to be able to train the mind.

&#x200B;

I'm not saying that to criticize, I'm genuinely curious about it.

I read the story from someone who got into a one-year thailand retreat and was not doing much during all that year, he admitted not being asked much by others because he was a foreigner (??) but I believe that even if he was doing some tasks the result would have been similar.

He said his mind got peaceful by being extremely secluded from all the pressuring things of the world, but that as soon as he had to come back into the world for administrative purposes and having to confront the effervescence of the world, people being in hurry, not being considerate, the peace disappeared.

So I understand it as if his mind wasn't trained enough to be immovable by the pressure of disagreeable things in the world.

&#x200B;

What do you think?

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1amjqca/do_you_think_going_forth_is_the_best_possible_way/kpqrent/)** _2024-02-10 04:50:42_:

    >He said his mind got peaceful by being extremely secluded from all the pressuring things of the world, but that as soon as he had to come back into the world for administrative purposes and having to confront the effervescence of the world, people being in hurry, not being considerate, the peace disappeared.

    Yes, this is the only peace that the vast majority of people who ordain get to experience, and it's mainly because of their wrong views of what the practice is about.

    Monastic life is, or at least was meant to be, where one can *begin* to confront the things of the world in their entirety, because it's only when you're not engaging with them that you get to see them in their fullness. That probably sounds absurd to someone who is immersed in the world, but it's when your engagements have been minimized in the way prescribed by the Vinaya that you start to come face to face with "pressuring things".  The full extent of pressure can only be experienced when there are no "outlets" for it in terms of bodily and verbal action, and blocking  those outlets is what monastic discipline is about.

    Not having those fixed constraints, counterintuitively, allows even a layperson who keeps the 8 precepts to let off some of the steam of their restraint without realizing it, and this is why not going forth is a compromise.

    Since people, when they take on the robe, think of virtue as only a set of observances that only need to be externally kept, and are basically just imitating the standards of whatever tradition they joined, they never force themselves to take on virtue "on the right level" as we say, meaning that, indeed, at some point things become peaceful and it seems like there is nothing further to do on that front, because the initial difficulty (if there was any) of the mere external adherence to the rules has faded.

    At that point, the natural assumption for most monastics is that the further "development" that's needed is in the meditation technique department, which will cement them even more in the wrong type of peace that comes from circumstantially avoiding disturbances.

    But beneath all that superficial peace, the *value* of the things of the world remains untouched. The work of wearing away that value is what would force one to confront those things that one only externally relinquished. A layperson is in a much less advantageous position to *question* that value to begin with because they still to some extent carry it forth through their very livelihood, even, again, if they keep the 8 precepts.

    The internal valuing of the world that remains is measured by whether or not a monastic *could* still disrobe, and to what extent, having done so, they would return to the same things that they previously relinquished. If they do so, it means that they were abstaining from those things only because their external *duty* of being in robes, which they no longer see a purpose for, obliged them to. They never took advantage of the external restraint to become internally and  irreversibly dispassionate towards the world.

    There is no inherent problem in [meditating with sensuality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_BeJMNM86A) from a worldly point of view. In an isolated analysis, it is better than coarser forms of sensuality such as anything that involves breaking the five precepts ***if*** it is being done at the expense of those more unwholesome things. If a person totally replaces those things with their "meditation" of choice, it will probably lead to a better rebirth at least. (But even that is quite an achievement; most people do their "meditation" on the side of their coarse sensual engagements. They don't even replace one with the other).

    However, when it does becomes a net negative by far rather than a net positive is when people start thinking that by engaging in such meditation, they are on some level partaking in the Buddha's teaching, and when they start using Buddhist terminology such as jhānas, wisdom, Four Noble Truths, etc., to talk about the experiences that result from those practices. They then start to not only delude themselves, but also others who might've strived for and achieved *actual* freedom from suffering rather than this bogus version of it that's available for much cheaper.

    If a person's goals are limited to the 4 things you listed, then potentially they can achieve that though doing what almost any "Buddhist" teacher today would instruct them to do. But ideally, if they insist in practicing like that, they better do so with the knowledge that that's not *actually* the Buddha's teaching, and that the true purification from defilements comes at a higher price than they're currently willing to pay.

    If they want to achieve *freedom from suffering* in the Buddha's definition, however, then seeing any value in meditating with sensuality will become a categorical obstacle. It will prevent them from ever finding out what sensuality actually is, as they think they're already abandoning it by getting these counterfeit "jhānas", and yet they're not even scratching the surface.

### Ajahn Chah's approach to mediation

In this talk Ajahn Chah talks about using meditation to calm the mind to then give rise to mindfulness.

>We take note of these three points \[nose-tip, chest, abdomen\] in order to make the mind firm, to limit mental activity so that mindfulness and self-awareness can easily arise.

Is this approach also valid? Or is it that any progress with the meditation approach as apposed to the wisdom approach (as the talk goes on to mention) is only due the work of changing your actions based on awareness of intentions which is now more discernable due to the meditation.

[https://www.ajahnchah.org/book/On\_Meditation1.php](https://www.ajahnchah.org/book/On_Meditation1.php)

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1akcirs/ajahn_chahs_approach_to_mediation/kpbe6qe/)** _2024-02-07 11:14:41_:

    The gist of it is that Ajahn Chah seems to not have had a sharp sense of what exactly obstructs the majority of people from reaching what he (most likely) did attain, and to not have had a very technical knowledge of the Suttas. What he describes in the context of meditation is how things would unfold for a mind that has already been trained and withdrawn from the things that actually obstruct calmness (sensuality and aversion): by that point you can genuinely just *choose* to "let go" of your thoughts and only contemplate your breathing, for example, without it being unwholesome. That is what it means for the mind to be "pliable"; it seamlessly goes along with whatever you tell it to do.

    But it is impossible for it the mind to be malleable like this for whomever has not first tamed it through renunciation and restraint, which, based on statements from his disciples, was the subject of the majority of his talks to the monks. Ajahn Chah giving a discourse on meditation practice was rare, but the ones he gave are obviously what has been given the most emphasis.

    For people whose minds are still pulled by sensuality, what attending to the breath and trying to "let go of preoccupations" will result in is a contrived attempt to *suppress* their thinking and mental movements, which means that they're trying to run away from things to be free from them. The exact same principle of sensuality and craving lies behind their endeavor of attaining samādhi, because that's the impetus that their minds still carry, maintained through nothing other their unrestrained actions: chasing pleasure and avoiding pain. 

    >“The Blessed One, brahmin, did not praise every type of meditation, nor did he condemn every type of meditation. What kind of meditation did the Blessed One not praise? Here, brahmin, someone abides with his mind overcome by sensual passion, a prey to sensual passion, and he does not understand as it is the escape from arisen sensual passion. ***While he harbours sensual lust internally***, he meditates, premeditates, out-meditates, and mismeditates. He abides with his mind overcome by ill will, a prey to ill will…with his mind overcome by sloth and torpor, a prey to sloth and torpor…with his mind overcome by restlessness and remorse, a prey to restlessness and remorse…with his mind overcome by doubt, a prey to doubt, and he does not understand as it is the escape from arisen doubt. ***While he harbours doubt internally,*** he meditates, premeditates, out-meditates, and mismeditates. The Blessed One did not praise that kind of meditation.

    —MN 108

    "Harboring internally" means that, due to not even understanding what the hindrances are and how they are abandoned, those hindrances remain at the back of one's mind no matter what one is meditating upon and experiencing. So due to not having actually dealt with the problem of sensuality beforehand, and trying to jump right away into watching their breath, sensuality is there whether the person realizes it or not—even if they are able to attain some (from their ordinary point of view) special blissful states. The hindrances are not particular thoughts that you can get rid of by attending to something else; they are the context with which you live your life and relate to your experience, including while you are watching your breath or what have you. That context cannot be removed by *doing* something directly; it is either fueled or starved indirectly through the choices you make by body, speech, and mind (AN 10.61).

     In MN 125, the Buddha states that the reason why a certain prince cannot comprehend what unification of mind (*ekaggatā*) is is because his mind is still bent on sensuality, not because he hasn't been focusing on his breath long or well enough.

    Likewise, for a person in a similar position, which is just about everyone today, any meditation they do and unification of mind they attain will be underlain by their sensual inclinations, evidenced by how they would perfectly be able to enjoy worldly pleasures on the side, whereas if they were truly attaining the right type of calm that Ajahn Chah is pointing to, those things would start to become repulsive and unthinkable to engage in.

    > “Bhikkhus, without giving up these six things, it is impossible to dwell in the first jhāna having entered it. What six? Desire for sensual pleasures, ill will, dullness and drowsiness, restlessness and remorse, and doubt. **And the danger in sensual pleasures hasn’t been seen as it is with right understanding.** Without giving up these six things, it is impossible to dwell in the first jhāna having entered it.

    —AN 6.73

    The stage that Ajahn Chah is describing, where you can slow your breath down and quiet your thoughts, etc., would come about in the right way only if you have *already* conquered the hindrances and can let go of them at will. That's the only way that your mind will genuinely stay settled upon something *on its own,* with little to no need for ***you*** to be trying to stop thinking, and therefore that meditation would not be rooted in suppression, aversion and not wanting to take responsibility for the wildness of your own mind, looking for an easy shortcut instead.

    Hence, his giving that sort of instruction to beginners was—as regards teaching skill, which is ultimately a mundane factor and doesn't in itself invalidate his understanding—a mistake. He was talking as if it would just be as simple for anyone as it was for him.

    In contrast, in AN 8.63 for example, the Buddha instructs the monk that he must get his mind to be stable and  unmoved by unwholesome states ***before*** he starts practicing the *brahmavihāras* and *jhānas*, not that he should practice those things *in order to* make his mind unmoved by unwholesome states, the topsy-turvy way in which people like to go about it, and which results in seeing anything but the true Dhamma.

    >“Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu who has five qualities can’t dwell having entered right composure. What five? It’s when a bhikkhu can’t endure sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and touches. A bhikkhu who has these five qualities can’t dwell in right composure having entered it."

    —AN 5.113

    If you can't endure the five senses *as they are* in your ordinary state of being without any sensuality or aversion arising whatsoever—if you are not already in total control of those five animals all the time—then whatever states of samādhi you get will be wrong.

    It's as if there were a room that you're responsible for keeping clean and tidy: any attempt to leave the room when it's still a mess will be inevitably rooted in an aversion to doing your duty. But if the room is nice and orderly and *then* you decide to go to another room, it would not be because you're running away from the mess. You have nothing to fear if you were to stay in the current room indefinitely.

    In the same way, you would only be able to start shedding away the coarse aspects of thinking *after* it has been fully purified from sensuality and unwholesome states and you're already burden-free *all the time*, without having to attend to your breath at all. If you try do it before that, it will inevitably be because you're chasing a separate (also sensual) pleasure that will temporarily absolve you from the very task that would actually free you from disturbances eventually.

    (P.S. The fact that Ajahn Chah's teaching skills might not have been the best is concretely evidenced by how the actual essence of his message seems to have gone over his disciple's heads; just by reading his *already tampered-with* recorded talks carefully, one realizes that his living disciples are perpetually misrepresenting him. Who knows how much greater the discrepancy would be if we would have access to his verbatim statements).

### 22.95. A Lump of Foam

Would  love to get @bhikkhu_anigha interpretation of the Phenapindupama
sutta. From a pair of eyes with little dust🙏🙏.

https://suttacentral.net/sn22.95/en/bodhi?lang=en&reference=none&highlight=false

I always like to keep a sutta in my mind throughout my day and night, constantly reminding me to keep on track. M.n. 10 udana Bhiya sutta is one of them. The other is this Phenapindupama sutta. 


- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1ak3hu9/2295_a_lump_of_foam/kp6j5e4/)** _2024-02-06 14:31:40_:

    Things being "hollow, void, and insubstantial" does not mean that your *experience* of them is somehow "illusory" and that you need to uncover a hidden "reality" instead. This would be wrong because it would imply what your new way of experiencing things, that "reality" you discovered, is not *equally* hollow, void, and insubstantial. The Sutta itself says that *ALL* manifestations, no matter how exalted and unique they are, should be equally regarded. But people stop at the ordinary and don't apply the same context to their mystical meditative experiences, because then their mistaken emotional dependence on them—the fact that they still have the same attitude as ordinary people just in regard to a different thing—is automatically revealed.

    These similes the Buddha uses mean that things, the way in which they *already appear*, are hollow. So you don't need to be chasing down some special "direct experience" of emptiness, which is a fallacious notion, but simply understand that your everyday feelings, for example, ***while*** they are very intense and disagreeable sometimes, are not of any significance at all.

    The contemplation of lack of substance should not be done so as to *get rid* of the pressure that things exert, but to understand their nature *while* one is fully enduring their pressure.

    So instead of hoping for some special, esoteric experiences and *perceptions* of emptiness—yet another kind of worthless and insignificant  "shimmering mirage" that just happens to stand out from the rest—to arise on account of mechanical focusing, you would *genuinely* practice in line with the contemplation of the aggregates being hollow and void through renunciation and restraint.

    Restraining lustful and averse intentions in relation to certain cognized forms that are felt and perceived is how one is regarding all those things as a "lumps of foam, water bubbles, etc.". Committing sensual and averse actions is how you *do* implicitly regard the aggregates as substantial and meaningful whether you want it or not, regardless of what lofty ideas about emptiness you might have.

    All the talk on impermanence, suffering, not-self, and emptiness is just hot air unless a person is restraining their actions, because as the Buddha said, [actions are what the fool and the wise person are defined by](https://suttacentral.net/an3.2/en/bodhi?lang=en&reference=none&highlight=false).

    *"A wise person with great understanding is one who does not intend in a way that leads to their own harm, to the harm of others, or to the harm of both."*

    *—AN 4.186*

### Sensual Pleasure

What is sensual pleasure?

1. Is it the five chords of sensual pleasure that are wished for, desired, agreeable and likelable, connected with sensual desire, and provocative of lust?
2. Is it the same as the gratification on account of the pleasure and joy that arises dependant on these five chords of sensual pleasure?
3. Is it something apart from these?

MN 13. The Greater Discourse on the Mass of Suffering
Sensual Pleasures
“And what, bhikkhus, is the gratification in the case of sensual pleasures? Bhikkhus, there are these five cords of sensual pleasure. What are the five? Forms cognizable by the eye that are wished for, desired, agreeable and likeable, connected with sensual desire, and provocative of lust. Sounds cognizable by the ear…Odours cognizable by the nose…Flavours cognizable by the tongue…Tangibles cognizable by the body that are wished for, desired, agreeable and likeable, connected with sensual desire, and provocative of lust. These are the five cords of sensual pleasure. Now the pleasure and joy that arise dependent on these five cords of sensual pleasure are the gratification in the case of sensual pleasures.”

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1ai7ys9/sensual_pleasure/kox2gzn/)** _2024-02-04 19:24:50_:

    1. Yes. The five cords of sensual pleasure are the five "avenues" of experiencing sensual pleasure. And as the definition says, it's particularly those things which are wished for, desired and agreeable most importantly (and this will depend on the individual). It's not taking about *objects of the five senses* in general, because those are sometimes neutral or even disagreeable.

    Thus, it's a fallacy when people think that becoming oblivious to the entire range of the 5 senses means escaping sensual pleasure; the thing that they are escaping *to*, the object or what have you that they're focusing intently on, is *also* "wished for, desired, and agreeable". It just happens to not be as coarse as what can be perceived with the senses in ordinary life, which does not make the situation any better apart from that this pleasure doesn't require engaging in misconduct to seek out things externally. It's not a real escape, because no understanding of danger whatsoever, nor of gratification for that matter, has taken place.

    2. The gratification is the pleasure and joy that arise from experiencing things that are desired. So it's referring to something that you experience *on top of* the sense objects that are in themselves already agreeable, and it's on the basis of that "peripheral" feeling, not the "foreground" one which is always pleasant, that pleasure from the five senses can be *emotionally and "existentially"* gratifying at all.

    To illustrate this, imagine experiencing the most delightful pleasure of the senses while suffering from acute depression. The pleasure at the foreground is *exactly the same*, but at the background the mind is not really enjoying it, so it's not "gratifying" at all. If that pleasure were in itself what gratifies, and not the *mental* joy and elation that sometimes arises and sometimes doesn't, people could be cured from depression no matter how severe instantaneously by just getting bombarded with things that their senses enjoy.

    But everyone knows that that's not how it works. On the contrary, people often fall into depression due to having had *too much* access to sensual pleasures, to the point where nothing can make them feel that pleasure and joy on the mental level again, no matter how much pleasure their *senses* experience.

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1agc9lg/deleted_by_user/kokw670/)** _2024-02-02 12:44:59_:

    The best and only way to start even seeing what "maintaining the context in the background" means is upping one's threshold of restraint. Keeping the precepts and restraining the senses *forces* you, whether you realize it or not, to have at least some degree of context present without making it into a foreground because the "foreground" will always be occupied by the situation that's tempting you to break the precepts.

    If, having *not* done that to the necessary degree, one tries to start sustaining the context as a background to one's *thoughts*, which is takes much subtler discernment, there is no way that one will not be turning that context into an object of attention in some way, even if one thinks one isn't doing so. If those prerequisites have been met on the other hand, one won't even have to *try* not to make the context into an object of attention: that mistake will have become obvious and impossible to fall into.

    This is why the precepts and restraint are not "entrées before the main course". The entire gradual training is about the same background-foreground training, on successively more refined levels (keeping in mind that the first "stage" of keeping the precepts is not just about sticking to external rules of behavior, which in itself requires little to no context, but about "seeing the danger in the slightest fault" as the Buddha put it).

### Possible explanation on how meditation methods lead to enlightment?

I have found this article called "An Enlightened Mind Has Done This: Two Types of Objectification", written by a certain Mr. Roger Thisdell, who claims to have become enlighted in may 2021. There he explains how the meditation methods he´s trained in led to his enlightment: 

[https://www.rogerthisdell.com/post/an-enlightened-mind-has-done-this-two-types-of-objectification](https://www.rogerthisdell.com/post/an-enlightened-mind-has-done-this-two-types-of-objectification)

He also presents a phenomenological model of the enlighted mind, or so I understood, in this one: 

[https://www.rogerthisdell.com/post/centrelessness-boundarylessness-phenomenology-and-freedom-from-the-cage-of-the-mind](https://www.rogerthisdell.com/post/centrelessness-boundarylessness-phenomenology-and-freedom-from-the-cage-of-the-mind)

I would appreciate if the more experienced members of the community could help with pointers on instances of right/wrong view in the reasoning presented.

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1agagmv/possible_explanation_on_how_meditation_methods/kojvta8/)** _2024-02-02 05:54:34_:

    The elephant in the room here is one celebrated but gratuitous notion which is greatly responsible for the distortion and decline of the Dhamma:

    The view that, _to any extent_, "things are not what they seem", and that _this_ is what insight is about.

    > We take those parts of ourselves initially perceived to be most intimately us, and observe them with sustained and clear perception so that we come to understand them **in a much more raw, bare-bones fashion (meaning without a narrative/conceptual/languaging interpretation).\[...\]**

    > When the adept meditator presses her fist into a wooden table **she** _**perceives**_ **the tactile points of pressure as amorphous clusters of sensations** that are not just expanding and contracting in terms of shape and intensity of feeling (which they do), but also the sense of the table or thing disappearing altogether, in a phenomenologically microscopic way. **The feeling of ‘hardness’ is flowing and evaporating, and not fixed for her.**

    > Through sustained observation, we come to see that all that appears in the mind is not only impermanent but empty in nature. **Appearances not only arise and then vanish, but as soon as they arise they are already disappearing;** and anything and everything that is scrutinised with clear attention is realised to be lacking inherent existence. No phenomenological data point has a solid core to it. All content taken to be an object is seen as a fabrication. _**Everything is a process. A verb.**_\[...\]

    > It is as though each data point of experience is known to itself, in its own place, and doesn’t relay back to some central point of knowing. If I feel a sensation in my knee, the knowing of the sensation is all in the knee and there isn’t a sense that that sensation is related to anything happening in the head. **Sensations appear in their own place and that information lacks directionality.**\[...\]The process was perceived like this:

    > Attention is aimed down to the knee from the head → sensation in knee detected → sensation data sent back up to the head → sensation is now known in the head, but happening ‘down there’.

    > **Now, all this directionality and time delay is removed from the process of knowing sensations.**This is particularly cool when hearing sounds, as the sounds are perceived/ processed/understood/known from their origin. **I no longer have the sense that I am hearing from my ears, or that sounds travel to my ears.** [...]

    The view underlying most of contemporary Buddhism and meditation is that [the problem of ignorance is in _**how**_ experience shows itself to us](https://www.hillsidehermitage.org/the-nature-of-ignorance/), based on which one concludes that by _altering_ how experience manifests, by bringing about any conceivable _**different mode of perception**_, one is abandoning ignorance and giving rise to the knowledge that the Buddha talked about.

    But this is catastrophically wrong for various reasons, and it is based on this wrong conception alone that meditation methods gain any value. The performance of these techniques eventually allows for these different modes of experiencing things (which can then be misconceived by an ignorant mind to be the true _anicca, dukkha,_ and _anattā_) to arise—there's no denying that, and it certainly takes a lot of dedication to achieve those results. But there is no reason why _meditation_ is the only way to reach this—psychoactive drugs could result in the same at least momentarily, which is why some people (including monks sometimes) believe that either of these two things _even remotely_ could be an instrument on the path to enlightenment (at least the one that the Buddha attained and taught the Dhamma for).

    > “From wrongness comes failure, not success. And how is it, bhikkhus , that from wrongness comes failure, not success?

    > “In a person of wrong view, wrong resolve comes into being. In a person of wrong resolve, wrong speech. In a person of wrong speech, wrong action. In a person of wrong action, wrong livelihood. In a person of wrong livelihood, wrong effort. In a person of wrong effort, wrong recollection. In a person of wrong recollection, wrong composure. In a person of wrong composure, **wrong knowledge. In a person of wrong knowledge, wrong liberation.**

    > “This is how from wrongness comes failure, not success.

    —AN 10.103

    The Buddha stated unambiguously what "the problem" is, and it's not the way in which your perceptions _**arise**_ (which includes whether or not there seems to be a "center" to them), but the _**attitude**_ that you hold towards experience, with no regard in any shape or form for _how_ it has arisen.

    > “Therefore, bhikkhus, **any kind of form whatsoever**, whether past, future, or present, internal or external, **gross or subtle, inferior or superior,** far or near, all form should be seen as it is with correct wisdom thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’

    > **“Any kind of feeling whatsoever … Any kind of perception whatsoever … Any kind of activities whatsoever … Any kind of consciousness whatsoever**, whether past, future, or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near, all consciousness should be seen as it is with correct wisdom thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’

    —SN 22.59

    > “Now this, bhikkhus, is the noble truth of the origin of suffering: it is this craving which leads to renewed existence, accompanied by delight and lust, seeking delight here and there; that is, craving for sensual pleasures, craving for being, craving for non-being.

    > “Now this, bhikkhus, is the noble truth of the cessation of suffering: it is the remainderless fading away and cessation of that same craving, the giving up and relinquishing of it, freedom from it, non-reliance on it.

    —SN 56.11

    > “Bhikkhus, when one **lives contemplating danger in things that can fetter, craving ceases.** With the cessation of craving comes cessation of clinging; with the cessation of clinging, cessation of existence … cessation of birth … aging-and-death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair cease. Such is the cessation of this whole mass of suffering.

    > “Suppose, bhikkhus, an oil lamp was burning in dependence on oil and a wick, and the man would not pour oil into it or adjust the wick from time to time. Thus, when the former supply of fuel is exhausted, that oil lamp, not being fed with any more fuel, lacking sustenance, would be extinguished. So too, when one lives contemplating danger in things that can fetter, craving ceases…. Such is the cessation of this whole mass of suffering.”

    —SN 12.53

    > “Whatever ascetics and brahmins at present **regard** that in the world with a pleasant and agreeable nature as permanent, as happiness, as self, as healthy, as secure: they are nurturing craving. In nurturing craving they are nurturing acquisition. In nurturing acquisition they are nurturing suffering. In nurturing suffering they are not freed from birth, aging, and death; they are not freed from sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair; they are not freed from suffering, I say.

    >“Whatever ascetics and brahmins at present **regard** that in the world with a pleasant and agreeable nature as impermanent, as suffering, as nonself, as a disease, as fearful: they are abandoning craving. In abandoning craving … **they are freed from suffering, I say.**

    —SN 12.66

    These rarefied modes of perception that meditation techniques can give rise to are also within "that in the world which is pleasant and agreeable", the true sense of self being on the level of how you _regard that._ It's the background context and assumptions you hold towards all those "insights" and experiences (and that you're drifting further and further away from recognizing by putting the emphasis on these "special" instances of the aggregates). Whether you _perceive_ a center to the experience or not is beyond irrelevant to the understanding of _anattā_, and thinking that liberation is to be found in that is ironically a failure to see _**all**_ perception as lacking any eminence whatsoever (which is what true ["emptiness"](https://suttacentral.net/sn22.95/en/bodhi?lang=en) is about).

    The insight, the "transcendental" knowledge the Suttas talk about, is about understanding the banal and mundane things that you have always experienced since the day you were born and before (elation, sadness, lamentation, confusion, pressure, uncertainty, restlessness, desire, aversion...), not about _**experiencing**_ transcendental things, which is a contradiction in terms: as soon as you regard an experience—which can never be anything apart from form, feeling, perception, intentions and consciousness—as transcendental and liberative, you have no clue what is truly transcendental and liberative for that very reason.

    And, of course, the Buddha's diagnosis of what the root of suffering is forces one to effect a fundamental change in one's actions and way of living life, whereas this doesn't, as long as you can put in the time for it, like any other mundane skill.

    As a sidenote to all this, this wrong view of what insight is about naturally leads to the loss of the categorical divide in the Suttas between puthujjana and ariya, as well as the assumption that the former can just _choose_ to regard their in the way an ariya would if they just try. This ensures that whoever puts their effort into this won't ever develop themselves in the way that matters so that they _can_ regard their experience rightly in the first place (in the Buddha's definition) because they think they _already are doing so_ by looking at things "objectively" so that there is no sense of self, failing to see that one is a puthujjana _**because**_ whatever one imagines the sense of self to be actually isn't, and _**because**_ the true sense of self survives completely unscathed behind any observation of not-self one may engage in.

### Relationship between precepts and craving

Up till now I thought that keeping the five precepts was to prevent actions rooted in coarse forms of craving, but after reflecting on this, I think there may be some issues with this understanding. For me it's certainly true that if I were to break the five precepts, it's quite clearly due to the resistance to what is currently felt. But these actions of killing, stealing, lying, etc., seem entirely possible without craving.

For example, the Nazis seemed to have entertained a whole lot of dehumanization of the Jews which allowed them to kill them quite dispassionately at such a high rate. I imagine there's probably certain people in the world where the act of killing has been stripped of its significance of taking-the-life-of-another and become just another mechanical act in the same way as, say, washing the dishes. Maybe hitmen fit the bill here: someone calls them up, tells them to kill this person for whatever amount, they find their target at a random place, shoot them up, and job done. In the same way as I throw out garbage once a week -- there's no craving involved here.

The reason why I'm thinking in terms of this hypothetical is because if it is the case that precepts can be broken without coarse forms of craving, then the whole reason of keeping them to restrain from coarse craving seems to be redundant. And so that must imply there's some other more important reason/principle that I'm missing out on here.

The reason why I kept the precept to not kill is because I used to kill tens of bed bugs every day because they made it impossible for me to sleep, and then one day I recognized the possibility that perhaps these bed bugs are just like me and other humans, except in different form: all of them wanting to live and not wanting to die. So then I gave up killing, but I still recognize the possibility of killing in extremely threatening circumstances.

The reason why I kept the precept to not steal and lie was because in both these acts there was an element of hiding an action from others. While I might steal and consequently hide the act of stealing, in doing so, the entire burden and weight of that act would always be on me. Constantly thinking: "what if others find out about this?"; it felt like these actions were literally in my shadows ALL the time. Whenever I was alone, I would just be constantly reminded of what I did and how bad it was regardless of how insignificant the act was, like even stealing one dollar. At a certain point, the burden of what I'd done in the past was so much that it made me crazy and I realized it'll be beneficial for me to never steal and lie.

I'm too young to break the other precepts, but I naturally didn't incline towards it.

These were my reasons for keeping the precepts prior to the Dhamma. But when I encountered HH, I recall hearing that they should be kept as development of the mind/restraining coarse forms of craving. And so I thought that that was a better and more superior principle (which could then be extended to other acts much more naturally) to mine, but now I seem to be in a dilemma where it seems even this reason has something superior to it.

As a side note, reflecting on what I've written, I notice that I hold the view that craving is a kind of on/off switch; sometimes there is craving, sometimes there isn't. But given the fact that there is craving so long as there is avijja, that suggests one inflicted with avijja cannot not have craving at any particular instance of their life. But this doesn't make sense. There are clearly times when there's no pressure/resistance towards anything within my experience; some instances where I'm very calm or serene, or even after satisfying sensual desires and thoroughly having the sense that I'm "done with it" for now.

Would appreciate any help here.

    This is where the gist is at. You should keep the precepts not because they make you not suffer (i.e. not have craving) *now*, but because keeping them reduces your *liability* to suffering (i.e. liability to craving). Yes, craving is always there to some degree for as long as there is ignorance, but that doesn't mean that it's *symptoms*, such as pressure and suffering, are always there (or at least not in the strength that a puthujjana who by default overlooks these things would be able to recognize them .

    While a person who gets used to killing might at a certain point stop experiencing the strong craving and therefore suffering that lead them to commit that action in the first place, becoming "numb" to it, they will still  unavoidably be sentencing themselves with every further action to feel that much more "confined" by displeasure, due to feeling the impulse to get rid of it by any means like they did the previous million times (just like a drug addiction). The *assumption* that displeasure requires a response is inevitably strengthened, and the strength of that assumption is the degree to which *not* responding to displeasure will result in suffering (same for sensuality).

    >The reason why I kept the precept to not kill is because I used to kill tens of bed bugs every day because they made it impossible for me to sleep, and then one day I recognized the possibility that perhaps these bed bugs are just like me and other humans, except in different form: all of them wanting to live and not wanting to die. So then I gave up killing, but I still recognize the possibility of killing in extremely threatening circumstances.

    So in this example, it's not that once your aggregate of virtue is developed you would cease to feel (even acute) displeasure on account of the bed bugs. The peace from virtue is in recognizing you no longer needing to do anything *about* that displeasure no matter how acute it is, and thus it's not a problem. Virtue is thus the stepping stone to learning how to "not suffer amidst suffering".

    Therefore, *any* breach of virtue, no matter how much it hurts or doesn't *right now*, is cultivating the opposite, "suffering amidst suffering", because you're cultivating the attitude that displeasure (or lack of pleasure) *is* in fact such a big problem that it seemingly justifies these unrestrained actions. If that arisen feeling was not implicitly suffered-in-regard-to, no matter how little, you wouldn't have committed the action in the first place.

### Root of hindrances

From what I understand, Ajahn Nyanamoli advocates to train until one is able to see when one's intentions are rooted in the hindrances and to endure the discomfort that these hindrances brought with them without acting out of it, doing it over time (months, years) will allow the mind to cool down and these hindrances to lose their grip.

&#x200B;

Is there a need to keep digging at the root of the hindrances after or during the process?

&#x200B;

Recently I've started to put the finger on the fact that sometimes symptoms ill-will or agitation seem to arise when something doesn't go as planned.

Anger/irritation can make itself felt when I'm expecting something of my fellow man that I judge normal or common civism and the opposite happens (e.g. I'm waiting in line, someone come and go at the start of the line instead of the back).

Agitation and worry can make itself felt when I'm expecting the circumstances to go one way, and it doesn't go as planned (e.g. I thought traffic would be as usual and that I would be on time at work, but there is an accident on the road and now I'm going to be late and everything that goes with it).

&#x200B;

From my point of view it seems like ill-will or agitation weren't already present, but the fact that I had expectations and that they got undermined by circumstances caused these hindrances to show up.

From here, should one accept that they have expectations and that it would be undermined by circumstances resulting in hindrances, and endure these hindrances on that level?

Or should one work on these expectations and free themselves from it so that the hindrances can't appear because of it in the first place?

&#x200B;

I come to you essentially because I don't exclude that there is a possibility the hindrances were already there and that it could be why circumstances not meeting expectations resulted in symptoms of ill-will and agitation, since this doesn't appear to me to be the case I might have it completely backward and the task could then be more daunting than what I thought.

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1afe5du/root_of_hindrances/kojiso4/)** _2024-02-02 04:02:36_:

    >Is there a need to keep digging at the root of the hindrances after or during the process?

    It's not like there is a  deeper "root" of them that a person would be able to access and "dig out" while the prior training has not yet unfolded sufficiently. Rather, for as long as one's virtue and sense-restraint (not sense-denial) could be more strict than it is at the moment, one could address the hindrances better.

    It cannot be emphasized enough that the hindrances *are* the actions that are committed on account of pressure, be they coarse or very subtle. The point of the training that people have a tendency to want to do as soon as possible, the which is the mental purification part, is about exactly the same restraint as the bodily and verbal purification. It's not like then you start "digging up" some hidden energies in your mind, but that the recognition of your own intentions behind your actions is now sufficient for the way in which upi *mentally* proliferate thoughts and pressures to become apparent *on its own*, without having to "dig it up" deliberately. One then is able to restrain effortlessly in the same way you'd prevent yourself from breaking a precept: you are *already* aware of yourself about to do something with your arm or say something with your mouth, it's impossible not to be, so you simply abstain from it. But the accurate recognition of those choices won't be even there without thorough development of restraint in regard to the coarser choices., just as it's impossible to even notice, let alone get rid of,[ the subtle impurities in gold while the coarse ones are still present.](https://suttacentral.net/an3.101/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=sidebyside&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin)

    So, it's not the expectations that you have about other people, or anything else that you could be aware of by *trying* to be aware of it by choice. It's something that will eventually become apparent by itself only once the mind  has become steady at the level where there is no further work to be done regarding body and speech. And that alone should result in a certain degree of[ "blameless ease".](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoOIYwY39eE)

### How is Stream Entry not a “special experience?”

I’ve read this sentiment a couple times recently.  It seems to me that the moment one achieves this that it would be quite special!

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1ae95hq/how_is_stream_entry_not_a_special_experience/kk963th/)** _2024-01-30 13:23:53_:

    What u/no_thingness  wrote is essentially correct:

    There can be a "special experience" of joy and relief on account of *recognizing* stream-entry, but stream-entry in itself is not an experience; it's an *understanding* of the nature of all experience. So no matter how lofty and sublime the realization that one now sees the Four Noble Truths is, *that* experience is also known as impermanent, suffering, and unownable, so in that sense it's not more "special" than the experience of any other feeling which has been understood in that same way. The usual view is that one understands the nature of things *because* of getting some experience, and that's completely the wrong way round.

    It's thought that stream-entry is achieved by getting a "glimpse" of Nibbāna, and therefore the *experience* of that glimpse *is* the breakthrough. But that's plain absurd because if you forgot about that glimpse, in just the same way as you would forget some experience that happened in your childhood that was *at the time* really special, you would lose your sotāpatti.

    It's irrelevant whether people then claim that "No no, ***this*** experience is different from all others and you can never forget it". That's just a testament to how they haven't at all understood how "*everything* that is of the nature to arise is of the nature to cease".

### Unable to take the precept of non-lying

I am not able to take the precept of non-lying with its full value. It feels like it's just too much weight I could take on. Even celibacy seems easier to me than this. It is not like I keep lying and so it is hard to take up this precept but I have lied on occasions. When I contemplated on what things exactly prevent me from taking this precept, I came to know that it was due to emotional attachment to my parents / family. Specifically, there have been some situations where if I had to tell a small deliberate lie that would result in much lesser unpleasant emotions to my parents or so, I have chosen to lie. And if I do take the precept right on, I know internally that I am not ready if the worst possible thing would challenge me.

Here in my culture lying isn't even considered something quite bad or so. I am not trying to rationalize lying but just that in my environment how trivial is lying considered and how my attitude towards it has been unfortunately shaped.

I am really not sure how to go about this. I have been keeping the other 4 precepts and celibacy but I guess that this might be a fruitless endeavor. I would be grateful for any comments on this.

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1advtmb/unable_to_take_the_precept_of_nonlying/kk99toi/)** _2024-01-30 13:51:23_:

    With this sort of situation, it's always the same principle: one will not be able to get out of it until one has a good enough reason to put up with the displeasure of restraining oneself. It's not about hoping that restraining yourself and being more virtuous will *stop* being painful.

    To an extent, it can help to clarify exactly *why* lying is for your own harm. More specifically, how the choice to not tell the truth in every single situation, though seemingly less unpleasant on the surface, involves a deeper, more "thorny" kind of suffering than any form of displeasure that would come from telling the truth.

    Lying can be momentarily less painful but it always entangles you more on the emotional level, because next time, telling the truth will be that much more difficult—you're becoming more existentially dependent on avoiding displeasure each time you do it.

    The pain of telling the truth is momentarily worse, but there is no accumulation of burden for the future on account of it. It's like the pain of enduring heat, cold, hunger, etc. It can be very sharp, but emotionally it doesn't *have* to bother you if train your mind, and it doesn't bring any additional repercussions.

### Am I discerning correctly?

Trying to wrap my head around using mindfulness to discern my thoughts and behaviours. I would be grateful if someone could scrutinise my thoughts so far with the following example:

Context: former binge eating disorder. Currently eat 90% healthy, squashed my habit of needing occassional snacks to keep my diet "sustainable", now eating more like a monk i.e. gathering foodstuffs and eating them indiscriminately instead of needing a recipe meal, trying to reach my goal of not needing junk/treats ever again.

The other night, work was terrible. Incredibly understaffed, having to work through my breaks and doing lots of overtime. Sleep deprived. Mind is agitated. I didn't have time to cook a substantive meal, so I had to run to the shop and get a sandwich, scoff it down and get back to work. On the way home at night, I wanted to get a takeaway. I was mindful and knew I wasn't hungry as the sandwich removed that hunger, but I thought that because work was terrible and ruined my break, I wanted to recuperate, basically 'feel better' by indulging in a takeaway. Typing it now cringes me, but I was very distressed in the midst of it.

Anyway, I started paying attention to my thoughts. The first thought was 'it's been a shitty night and I deserve to treat myself', then the next thought was 'I had to work through my break for the fifth time this week and it's unfair, I want to recuperate and have some me-time'. Thought after that was 'this is too hard'. I understood the thoughts as manifestations of craving, and recollected that if I gave into them, the next time I get cravings, it would be due to my past actions. However the pressure got incredibly strong and I thought 'sorry man, it's too difficult tonight, I give in' and was about to pull up to buy food. Then I stopped and realised that very last thought was no different from the rest, but I identified it as 'me' thinking, as if there was all these thoughts over there, but I'm over here observing it all with my own thoughts. As soon as I recollected that, I was able to resist the pressure. After that, I felt proud of myself for resisting the pressure. However I then recognised that the feeling of pride wasn't my doing either, and identifying with it would perpetuate the permanent sense of self I already feel, so I stopped identifying with it in that moment, and with that I stopped caring whether the feeling of pride persisted or disappeared because it had nothing to do with me. Then I went home and slept.

Is this... at least... a less wrong way of discernment?

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1adukgl/am_i_discerning_correctly/kk88abw/)** _2024-01-30 07:11:16_:

    The fact that you restrained yourself is good, but there is still some "looking at the wrong place" happening.

    >Anyway, I started paying attention to my thoughts. 

    This is where you started on the wrong foot. Don't try to pay attention to your *thoughts* to find where craving is: thoughts will always be secondary manifestations, *symptoms* of the underlying craving. This is exactly why the "pressure got incredibly strong" in the first place: through trying to deal with the symptoms, the illness was being maintained., i.e., the attitude of "I want to get rid of these thoughts" is itself rooted in the same craving.

    Next time, look at what you are *feeling* overall, in the broadest sense, not in regard to this or that particular thought. That general feeling will be either a ease, unease, or neither. In this case there was a feeling of unease (that was there even *before* you were tempted to get more food), and all you had to do is recognize that and endure it on *that* level, not caring at all about what thoughts you were experiencing for as long as that feeling was still being endured. And you had to be doing that from when you were at work experiencing displeasure, not *after* when the temptations to act out of it started to manifest, which would've prevented them from being nearly as oppressive. By then it's too late, and all you can do at that point is grit your teeth and not act out.

    With this, the actual root of the issue, the tendency to *act out* of that feeling, which includes indulging in its thoughts *and* trying to get rid of them, would've worn out. If there is less pressure to act out of that background feeling, then the same thoughts might even arise but their *weight* would be much less, and you would have no trouble ignoring them. Just like when you might have a thought about eating your favorite food when you have no appetite at all: it's the same thought and the same prospect of pleasure, but you are not moved by it.

### Results versus deliberate decisions

I want to see if I am totally mistaken or not…

The way I understand, and in some (very few) cases know from experience, is that attachment,e.g.  is not something we eliminate directly as a willful act, but is a consequence of insight into the nature of things. 

Almost every aspect of the dhamma i would claim to understand (again, very minimal) has turned out like this.  It of course requires volition in the direction of things, but i have yet to say to myself “i will renounce this or that” or “i will no longer experience an emotional bond with this or that” and have it happen because i willed it.  My meager progress is almost like the rest of my experience:  i ultimately have no say in the matter; once i understood that i cannot breathe underwater it became impossible for me to ever even need to consider it.  That is an awful example, but hopefully my overall question and perspective are clearer.  

I appreciate any input. 

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1adetgv/results_versus_deliberate_decisions/kk3k3xt/)** _2024-01-29 12:58:11_:

    >The way I understand, and in some (very few) cases know from experience, is that attachment,e.g. is not something we eliminate directly as a willful act, but is a consequence of insight into the nature of things.

    >Almost every aspect of the dhamma i would claim to understand (again, very minimal) has turned out like this. It of course requires volition in the direction of things, but i have yet to say to myself “i will renounce this or that” or “i will no longer experience an emotional bond with this or that” and have it happen because i willed it.

    This is correct in a certain sense. The mind is what is attached to things, and it simply doesn't work such that you could directly tell it to "drop" things. All one's direct volition can do is either proliferate or starve the mind's attachments.

    So it is one's previous repeated choices to abstain from volitional actions that would proliferate attachment (choices of virtue and sense restraint) that eventually wear it out. There must be *some* degree of understanding involved in those choices for them to have a sound basis (e.g., knowing that the goal is freedom from suffering and that certain actions factually take one in the opposite direction), but true insight always arises as a *result* of attachments having worn away, not the other way around.

    This means that renunciation will inevitably be painful initially and will entail going "against the grain". One should not expect insight or disenchantment to arise *first* so that renunciation then becomes easy.

    >“What do you expect, Aggivessana? It is impossible that what is to be known through renunciation, seen through renunciation, reached through renunciation, realized through renunciation, will ever be known, seen, reached or realized by Prince Jayasena, who lives amidst sensuality, enjoys sensuality, itches with thoughts of sensuality, burns with the fever of sensuality, and is engaged in the pursuit of sensuality.

### Role of virtue beyond stream entry

As the title states, I'm interested in clarifying the role of virtue beyond stream entry. I understand why and how virtue and restraint play a key role in developing the Right View prior to stream entry. But once the fruit of stream entry has been attainewd, one's liability to suffer has been reduced to "7 grains of sand". At this point, they have the understanding that makes them "incapable of suffering amidst suffering". So, my question is, essentially, why bother being virtuous any more? Why follow the Noble 8fold path?

My current hypothesis is that it has to do with the belief in rebirth. As in, a stream enterer has at most 7 lifetimes left to live, so it makes sense to continue developing their practice in this life in order to shave down those remaining lifetimes and achieve "final extinguishment" as soon as possible. This is all well and good.

However, without the belief in rebirth, the entire framework seems to break down. In the sense that a stream enterer is incapable of suffering amidst suffering, but mundane pleasant vedana is still "agreeable" and easy to access, while Right Samadhi, which is supposedly far superior to anything that's accessible through the senses (again, something they would need to take on faith prior to experiencing for themselves), is much more difficult to cultivate, so they can "settle for" enjoying mundane pleasant vedana without any craving or attachment, afford to be lazy and careless all the time, and even engage in "wrong" conduct in this life with no liability to suffer on account of it.

What's wrong with my reasoning here?

E: I thought I'd reframe the question here -- Basically, if a stream enterer is "incapable of suffering amidst suffering", and therefore has barely any liability to suffering left, what motivates them to keep practicing? Is it the belief in rebirth? Or is it that whatever suffering that remains is painful enough that they still need to maintain their practice?

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1acfdj3/role_of_virtue_beyond_stream_entry/kjx7030/)** _2024-01-28 07:08:04_:

    >What's wrong with my reasoning here?

    Nothing, really. This is exactly why the lay stream-enterers of the Buddha's time would go back to their normal lives despite the fact that understanding the danger in sensuality is part and parcel of their insight. The understanding they gained did not depend on them continuing to follow any form of virtue or observances, which is in contrast to a puthujjana: if the latter stops "doing" whatever they regard as the practice, they will fall away from whatever development they had. This is why a stream enterer does not hold on to *any* practices and observances, not even the "right" ones of virtue, sense restraint, etc. (Keeping in mind that holding on to them and following them are not at all the same).

    Furthermore, even if they wanted to, they *cannot* experience the [results of their misconduct](https://suttacentral.net/an3.100/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=sidebyside&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin) in the same way and degree as a puthujjana. Being free from self view and knowing the noble truths is the reason for that:  the suffering caused by their actions does not "land" due their insight of not-self. The suffering that they *do* experience is the one that leads them to [commit the actions in the first place](https://suttacentral.net/an5.142/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=sidebyside&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin), and this is absolutely minuscule in comparison.

    And this is what people misunderstand: being free from suffering does not mean you don't experience unpleasant feeling; it means your mind is not troubled by it when it comes (that's what freedom from kamma is about). So even though a sotāpanna is liable to experience a lot of displeasure on account of their remaining fetters of sensualty, and ill will, that displeasure does not "touch" them. The feelings that come on account of those fetters and of acting out of them are within the first arrow, not the second. In other words, the difference between a sotāpanna and an Arahant or Anāgāmi is the magnitude of the first arrow that they experience, because of which the former is still liable to *act* in unwholesome ways due to that first arrow. The latter two are incapable of committing sensual or averse actions because they don't experience the pressure to do so in the first place.

    That being said, the sotāpanna's degree of development does entail a great reduction of the intensity of the first arrow as well, meaning that there are certain things that they would not even be *pressured* to do, namely the actions that would land them in the lower realms. This does not mean that they cannot break the five precepts, but that the *mental state* behind their transgression can never be as twisted as it can be for a puthujjana. (AN 3.101 referenced above). For example, they might intentionally kill under certain severe, threatening or very careless circumstances, but pure cruelty would most likely be impossible. Externally though, the action might look the same as a puthujjana's.

    “Bhikkhus, a person accomplished in view has given up six things. What six? Personality view, doubt, holding on to virtue and duty, and forms of passion, aversion, and muddledness that lead to states of misery. *\[apāya; traditionally this means the literal hells and so on, but it would also include intense suffering in this very life\]*

    —AN 6.90

    The only external actions that one who sees categorically cannot commit are outlined in AN 6.94. Those things cannot be done *without* the intensity of the 3 defilements that would lead them to states of misery.

    So, in the end, a noble disciple will only continue striving in the Noble Eightfold Path to the degree that they feel dissatisfied with the amount of freedom they gained. Some of them would be perfectly content with it, and they would have a natural tendency to still adhere to the five precepts the vast majority of the time, but they would not necessarily undertake things like celibacy and sense restraint, which are the requirements to take the mind *beyond* where it already is, for puthujjana and noble disciple alike. But within 7 births at most, or even at the time of their death in the current life, they will become dissatisfied with their progress and will take up the training seriously again.

    A puthujjana should purify their behavior like their life depends on it if they want to have a chance to get the Right View, but people's conception or a sotāpanna who is *always* pefectly diligent and virtuous, and who would suffer on account of their misconduct, is due to their own holding on to virtue and observances.

    True freedom is true freedom—there are no "buts" or "ifs" to worry about once it's attained. Adhering to constraints is only necessary for *progressing* towards greater freedom.

### Spreading a heart full of love

Hi fellow practitioners, 

I saw a video of Ajahn Nyanamoli talking about how the common practice of ‘spreading and sending’ metta- is basically useless, because, if I understood correctly, if your heart is truly full of metta you don’t have to spread it around, it’s instead just a friendly disposition toward all beings and phenomena.
He also said that the common practice of spreading metta is often used as a “coverup” and as an escape from difficult emotions- avoiding the task at hand- and that all sounds very sensible to me. 

But why does some suttas talk in this manner, how to make sense of texts like the one below? 
Anuruddhasutta—Bhikkhu Sujato. 

“And what is the limitless release of the heart? It’s when a mendicant meditates spreading a heart full of love to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of love to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will. They meditate spreading a heart full of compassion … They meditate spreading a heart full of rejoicing … They meditate spreading a heart full of equanimity to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of equanimity to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will. This is called the limitless release of the heart.
And what is the expansive release of the heart? It’s when a mendicant meditates determined on pervading the extent of a single tree root as expansive. This is called the expansive release of the heart. Also, a mendicant meditates determined on pervading the extent of two or three tree roots … a single village district … two or three village districts … a single kingdom … two or three kingdoms … this land surrounded by ocean. (…) “ 

Also, perhaps the following is a bit off topic, but I think it’s interesting to consider. 

The sutta then continues talking about how this pervasion and spreading results in different kinds of rebirths- among the company of gods of ‘limited radiance’,  ‘limitless radiance’, ‘pure radiance’ and, interestingly, among those of ‘corrupted radiance’ - apparently because of this; 
“Their physical discomfort is not completely settled, their dullness and drowsiness is not completely eradicated, and their restlessness and remorse is not completely eliminated. Because of this they practice absorption dimly, as it were.” 

Now, I don’t know how relevant it is to the practice of ultimate liberation to think about what kind of god one could become in a future birth. But I can’t help but wonder if those ‘forcefully practicing’ metta, in exclusion of ‘real practice’, may be on the path towards the gods of corrupted radiance..

Anyhow my question is- ‘spreading and radiating’ does seem to be a practice, and one which bears certain results, unless I’m misunderstanding something? 
I suppose that the friendly disposition which Venerable Nyanamoli described doesn’t exclude anything whatsoever, but it apparently lacks the ‘radiating’.

    There's a few widespread distortions in translation to clear up:

    Firstly, *mettā* is not "love". "Love" is *pema,* and this needs to be ["abandoned, cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future. "](https://suttacentral.net/an4.200/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin)

    >Sorrow springs from love,

    >fear springs from love;

    >one free from love

    >has no sorrow, let alone fear.

    —Dhammapada 213 (interestingly, Ven. Sujato has chosen to translate *pema* as "attachment" here instead of questioning his rendering of mettā)

    "Loving-kindness" would thus be similarly incorrect for *mettā*. A *mittā* (like *kalyānamittā)* is a "friend", and from this, the word *mettā* is derived, hence we use the term "friendliness" instead. Friendliness is a natural, inherent quality of a liberated mind (just like compassion, contentment, and equanimity), whereas "love", a little or a lot,  is a defilement.

    Apart from that, there is another misleading alteration in every translation I've seen so far:

    >***...meditates spreading*** a \[mind\] full of \[friendliness\] to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth.

     ("abides pervading", or "keeps pervading" in other cases)

    But what the Pāli actually says is

    > "***...dwells/abides having pervaded/suffused (pharitvā viharati)*** with a mind of friendliness the first, second, third and fourth direction. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, he dwells having pervaded the whole world with a mind of friendliness—abundant, expansive, boundless, free of enmity and aversion.

    They might seem synonymous, but there is a crucial difference. The former implies you are actively engaging in this *process/activity* of spreading mettā, whereas the latter means you "passively" dwell *having* *established* a this attitude towards the whole world (and then, to insert the famous line from the Karaṇīyametta Sutta, you protect that *attitude* like a mother would protect her only child).

    The idea that it's a "process" is not accidental, and these two ways of practice are mutually exclusive since each implies a completely different notion of what the state of mind to be cultivated (and to be abandoned) is.

    The sole purpose of practicing *mettā*, which is the foundation upon which the next 3 are built, is to [abandon ill-will ](https://suttacentral.net/an6.13/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin), and ill-will towards other people or events arises when there is an *unpleasant feeling* in regard to them and the mind is untrained in regard to such feelings. It's an *additional layer* on top of the unpleasant feeling, of you resisting that feeling and wanting it to go away, because of which you then project the issue externally and start blaming the other person, wishing them harm, plotting revenge, etc.

    And how do you know that it's an "additional layer"? Because often a *friend* can come along and do something that makes you feel displeasure, but you never hate them or wish them harm. You calmly put up with the disturbance and maybe even laugh it off (a prank, for example). But if a person you already dislike does the same thing and causes you the same discomfort or inconvenience, you get angry in a fingersnap. This gives a clue as to what "friendliness" actually is, and the fact that literally everyone already has it with *some* people at least, without having to go around saying "may you be happy" and smiling whenever they think about them. The problem is that this friendliness is affected with *love* and delight in company almost always, but the ***liberation of mind*** through *mettā (mettā-cetovimutti*, the term always used in the Suttas) must be based upon [seclusion, dispassion, cessation, and result in relinquishment](https://suttacentral.net/sn46.54/en/bodhi?lang=en&reference=none&highlight=false), as well as being immeasurable and all-pervasive, without bias for some beings over others.

    And as soon as you start thinking about specific people to "radiate beams of loving-kindness" towards them, you *are* biasing them right then and there. If you were to receive news at that very moment that they were murdered, the degree to which went out of your way to cultivate that sort of attitude for that specific person would be the degree to which you would be averse to whoever killed them, not wishing *them* well *just as much* as the victim.

    >And how is hate born of love? It’s when someone likes, loves, and cares for a person. Others treat that person with disliking, loathing, and detestation. They think: ‘These others dislike the person I like.’ And so hate for them springs up. That’s how hate is born of love.

    —AN 4.200 (already linked above)

    Now, upon taking a closer look, it will become apparent that this process of "spreading loving-kindness" and repetition of cheesy phrases that people do in the name of mettā is not about abandoning the *resistance* to the displeasure that other people cause you—it's about *getting rid* of the displeasure and replacing it with pleasure instead, so that, by "cheating" as it were, ill-will no longer arises. 

    But ultimately you cheat nobody but yourself, because you're not actually *training* your mind so that it becomes imperturbable in every circumstance, however the aggregates happen to manifest; you're *fabricating* a new circumstance that will prevent your untrained mind from showing its true colors temporarily. And with "temporarily" I mean until the day you die at the latest, because many people who are very committed to this can certainly keep those states of mind going for a long time at least to a degree, until something that's far beyond their tolerance threshold comes up.

    But the thing is, even they would realize, if they just took a moment to reflect with unrelenting honesty, that if they *stopped* engaging in that contrived "kindness" practice that pastes this artificial pleasure over the natural displeasure of interaction with other beings, the ill-will would eventually come back. So in the end, what you'd be practicing with that is literally *control* of your feelings, *ownership*, not relinquishment, endurance and most importantly purification of *craving* in regard to them.

    And this leads to the next point where many people go wrong: the *brahmavihāras* in general are not "skillful fabrications"; they are one amongst many ways the Buddha taught for the *abandoning* of fabrications. What I'm referring to here is the notion many people have that "OK, yes, mettā is ultimately a fabrication, but I'll use this fabrication to abandon the other ones and eventually 'drop' it". But that's not how it works. As I alluded to above, mettā is an *inherent quality* of an undefiled mind, it's not something you "do". That quality will be there *on its own* as soon as you correctly abandon what's obstructing it, which is the resistance to displeasure—and ***that*** is the "fabrication" (*saṅkhāra* born of *avijjā).* Even the most untrained puthujjana *naturally* wishes every other being well for as long as they have no reason to rejoice in their harm, and that "reason", when it's there, is always this internal resistance (that is not accidental and one is solely responsible for maintaining and proliferating).

    So to return to the passage, one "*dwells having pervaded* the entire world with a mind of friendliness*" immediately,* not through the application of some sequential technique that you just "do" and which may or may not work, but through *understanding and clarity of discernment,* i.e., when one recognizes the *possibility* of displeasure arising, whether it's caused by other people or by inanimate things, and makes a determination not to resist it and act out of it, *while the unpleasant feeling remains*, because that was never the problem; the *craving against it* was. 

    (That's [not to say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0SJ_E8PPIs) that the mind will [listen ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLJhJDSwzhg)to that determination you make [immediately](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of11wtHjudY), however.)

    This is how you *know* beyond doubt that your mind is established in true mettā: you don't need to go around sugarcoating the bad things other people do in order to prevent ill-will from arising. You can confidently have two recognitions in your mind simultaneously: "this person is a complete idiot" and "I do not harbor the slightest bit of animosity towards him". This is what the Buddha displays all throughout the Suttas.

    >Now, I don’t know how relevant it is to the practice of ultimate liberation to think about what kind of god one could become in a future birth. But I can’t help but wonder if those ‘forcefully practicing’ metta, in exclusion of ‘real practice’, may be on the path towards the gods of corrupted radiance..

    No. Unfortunately, such people would not be on the path to any of these rebirths, not on account of such practices at least, because elevating the mind up to the level of these realms requires an immense and factual lessening of one's underlying tendency to *aversion*, as opposed to a skill, great as it may be, in *masking* aversion by replacing displeasure with pleasure.

    These are the same realms that would be reached by developing the second jhāna, depending on one's proficiency in it.

    Edit: You can't arrive at that "whole world", "immeasurable" level by simply adding up every part of it. That "whole" has to be discerned as *one phenomenon* and then the attitude directed towards *that* (See for an example of this the "others might attack that bhikkhu" passage in MN 28). The whole is not the sum if its parts in this case.

### Meditation in the gradual training presented in DN 2

I have a few questions about the gradual training presented in DN 2 and I hope to hear the answers from -- especially anyone from the Hermitage:

1. What kind of meditation is recommended?

2. How exactly the five hindrances are abandoned?

3. Is it possible for a lay person to follow this training?

Thank you in advance for reading and/or responding.

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/19dzb2w/meditation_in_the_gradual_training_presented_in/kjcwxhp/)** _2024-01-24 15:11:21_:

    >What kind of meditation is recommended?

    Reflection on the benefits of renunciation and the danger of desire and aversion (MN 19, MN 106). Whenever the abandoning of hindrances is talked about in the Suttas, in DN 2 for example, it's reached by *reflecting* on the hindrances as unwanted and unbeneficial, until the reason for the hindrances being there (i.e., the lack of awareness of their true nature and the careless welcoming of them that follows as a matter of course) has been sufficiently worn out for the hindrances to *not* be there anymore.

    However, there is no way that one will mentally abandon the hindrances if physically and verbally one has not abandoned them, especially sensuality. And this is why virtue and sense restraint are a prerequisite for purification of mind in the Gradual Training. You'd be closer to freedom from hindrances by being virtuous and restrained than by practicing any contemplation on the basis of insufficient virtue, because it boils down to what the mind *values* deep down in the end, in the broadest scale of your entire life, not to what mental drills you go through in one particular sitting. 

    So a person who wasn't celibate before but now is, is *just on account of that* closer to the right meditation, because they couldn't possibly live that way by choice unless they, by a large margin, began to prefer renunciation over sensuality.

    >Is it possible for a lay person to follow this training?

    The Buddha is never seen teaching meditation or satipaṭṭhānas to laypeople in the Suttas (except once or twice to some who were already stream-enterers, and even then it wasn't satipaṭṭhānas but recollection of the Triple Gem). Not because they couldn't *try* to practice in the same way as monks, but because it wouldn't produce the kind of result that truly matters for as long as they didn't internally *c*herish renunciation enough to give up the very things that make them laypeople (which is not the clothes they wear, but the unrestrained behavior and pursuit of pleasure). And that's because, again, cherishing renunciation is the prerequisite for "success" in meditation, and laypeople in general are *afraid* of renunciation instead of cherishing it (AN 9.41). Meditation, as an advanced stage of the gradual training, is nothing but a further *cultivation* (*bhāvanā*) and refinement on a deeper level of the renunciation you already established. If you don't have it to begin with, what is there to cultivate and refine?

    Once renunciation is established externally, whether one lives in a house or in a monastery, it becomes a matter of learning how to contemplate rightly so that the mind can be internally purified too.

### Contemplation to assist Sila


If I understand correctly, it seems that HH encourages that alongside keeping the precepts, one should also contemplate themes such as: why they are keeping the precepts, the value of the precepts, if they know what keeping the precepts has to do with the Dhamma, the danger of sensuality/peril in ill will, etc etc. 

Ajahn Nyanamoli said in one video ("Do You have Faith") that one still unestablished in virtue should be contemplating such themes constantly & frequently to help accomplish themselves in virtue, since it is due to lacking confidence in the VALUE of virtue that one then lacks faith in keeping their restraint. 

In "The Meaning of Right Samadhi" (starts at around 27:15 ) the "samadhi of virtue" is also discussed, in which it is said again that while keeping the virtue and sense restraint, one should also be contemplating the danger and the benefit of virtue/sense restraint. 

Now, all of this makes sense and is pretty reasonable - as one who restrains would have that very restraint as practical fodder for their contemplation (ex: using your experiences of restraining from sensuality to contemplate the background pain of desire that restraint reveals), and one who contemplates would have further reason to restrain in their daily life  (since you know WHY you do it). A kind of washing one hand cleans the other scenario. Through restraint, you see the value. Through seeing the value, you restrain. 

However, (and I finally get to my question) how exactly is this idea of frequent contemplation to help one's VIRTUE supported by the Suttas? There are indeed suttas where the Buddha says that through pursuing the INSIGHT of the DANGER in sensuality and BENEFIT of Renunciation, he attained and abided in the first Jhana, but where is something similar mentioned for mere virtue and sense restraint? Not including ofc, the Sotapanna's recollection of his virtue seen in the Suttas (bc the fact that a Sotapanna recollects his unblemished virtue probably doesn't mean that a puthujjhana unaccomplished in sila should be doing the same??).

The best I can find is this - 

》》And what, mendicants, is the power of reflection?
 It’s when someone reflects: "Bad conduct of body, speech, or mind has a bad, painful result in both this life and the next.’‘ Reflecting like this, they give up bad conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, and develop good conduct by way of body, speech, and mind" 


But even this seems to suggest a sort of contemplation-once-and-then-you're-done-and-now-your-sila-is-perfect-forever situation, not some sort of day-in-day-out contemplation practice. 

Virtue as shown in the context of the gradual training doesn't mention any sort of contemplation alongside it ("Come, bhikkhu, be possessed of morality..."), hence the reason for my doubt in this sort of practice. Virtue and precepts seem like something "simpler" to me (at least from my humble not-yet-accomplished in virtue perspective) - that should not need this sort of intense and frequent reflection and contemplation in order to be fulfilled.

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/19djc5b/contemplation_to_assist_sila/kj7ixyw/)** _2024-01-23 15:55:23_:

    > There are indeed suttas where the Buddha says that through pursuing the INSIGHT of the DANGER in sensuality and BENEFIT of Renunciation, he attained and abided in the first Jhana, but where is something similar mentioned for mere virtue and sense restraint? 

    But in regard to what can that insight take place apart from the virtue and sense restraint that have been developed beforehand? How can you experientially recognize the benefit of something if you have never done it?

    >Before my enlightenment, while I was just a bodhisatta, not yet fully enlightened, it occurred to me too: ‘Good is renunciation, good is solitude.’ Yet my mind did not launch out upon renunciation and become placid, settled, and liberated in it, though I saw it as peaceful. It occurred to me: ‘Why is it that my mind does not launch out upon renunciation and become placid, settled, and liberated in it, though I see it as peaceful?’ Then it occurred to me: ‘I have not seen the danger in sensual pleasures and have not cultivated that; I have not achieved the benefit in renunciation and have not pursued it. Therefore my mind does not launch out upon renunciation and become placid, settled, and liberated in it, though I see it as peaceful.’

    —AN 9.41

    Since the very day the Buddha went forth, his adherence to the precepts was spotless, and yet here he's saying that still his mind was not becoming settled upon renunciation. This means his virtue was in place, but since he had not reflected upon the benefits of that virtue sufficiently in a way that would make his mind cease to *value* the things that he had given up through restrained behavior, he was unable to attain the *joy* of renunciation (i.e., samādhi, the first jhāna).

    So that's what the instruction to "reflect on the benefits of virtue", is pointing to, not that "*doing"* the virtue necessarily requires reflection. To the extent that the mind does not have samādhi,  it still does not *internally value* the virtue and sense restraint that have been established more than it values the pleasure that it has externally given up. There is external but not internal renunciation. And needless to say, it will be impossible to internally value and enjoy renunciation and consequently get samādhi while still externally being unvirtuous and unrestrained.

    There is nothing else that must be done to attain (right) samādhi apart from this, which is exactly what the Buddha did. Not to say that samādhi is *easy*: it'll probably take several years for most, and require the right view as well. But it's no more *complicated* than this, which is why the Suttas don't go into greater detail. ("Concentration" methods, on the other hand, are easy to get quick results from but convoluted in the end, since all this "patchwork" and supplemental techniques are necessary to deal with the situations where they don't work, plateaus, etc., and hence there's always more detail and information to add).

    >(bc the fact that a Sotapanna recollects his unblemished virtue probably doesn't mean that a puthujjhana unaccomplished in sila should be doing the same??).

    A sotāpanna who does that would be progressing further towards Arahantship; a puthujjana who does that properly (i.e. with yoniso manasikāra) would be purifying their mind from the obstacles that prevent them from getting the right view, so that:

    >...Then the Blessed One gave Sīha the general a progressive discourse, that is, a talk on giving, virtuous behavior, and heaven; ***he revealed the danger, degradation, and defilement of sensuality and the benefit of renunciation. When the Blessed One knew that Sīha’s mind was pliant, softened, rid of hindrances, uplifted, and confident,*** he revealed that Dhamma teaching special to the Buddhas: suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path. Then, just as a clean cloth rid of dark spots would readily absorb dye, so too, while Sīha the general sat in that same seat, there arose in him the dust-free, stainless Dhamma-eye: ‘Whatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessation.’

    Also, reflecting on virtue is not just for the sake of samādhi, but also to develop understanding as to what is wholesome and what is unwholesome. Understanding, by seeing it in one's own experience, how virtue and sense restraint are to be correctly practiced (internally, not in the sense of external observances) creates the basis for recognizing the Middle Way.

    For instance, all monks (at least in theory) keep exactly the same rules, but the lack of understanding of the *attitude/context* that makes virtue right often leads to the same precepts being taken as a form of self-mortification/denial of the world rather than the middle way. "Shunning the bait", to use the simile in MN 25. One doesn't need to be consciously trying to torture oneself to fall into that; all that's required is to not understand what wholesomeness is and why virtue is conducive to it, and one will automatically be running away from things rather than relinquishing them (and the techniques then come in to further the same wrong direction).

    That's why there's no such thing as even Right Speech, Right Action or Right Livelihood without Right View. Even when perfectly emulating every action the Buddha makes, a puthujjana's lack of direct knowledge of the nature of those actions and *why* they are beneficial would prevent them from being ultimately right *for them*. It would be *sīlabbataparāmāsa.*

### Question on Suffering as not self.

I don’t see with my own faculties how suffering is not self. It seems to me that the very nature of suffering is appropriation of form and impermanence against the grain of their qualities. Of the three marks, suffering is the most “personal.” It has to do with the person. Although, I’m sure there are impersonal, psychologically invisible forms of suffering going on under the hood. To see suffering as not self must be liberation and related to sottapannas and above. To see it directly. I think Volition has a similar issue. Does anyone know of resources that treat this topic in terms of practice or study?

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/19c6huv/question_on_suffering_as_not_self/kj0eap7/)** _2024-01-22 07:10:45_:

    >To see suffering as not self must be liberation and related to sottapannas and above.

    Seeing suffering *at all* is liberation and is what defines a sotāpanna and above.

    What a puthujjana regards as suffering is necessarily superficial and mundane, insufficient to fit the bill of what the Four Noble Truths are about. So it's not like one starts out already seeing what *dukkha* is and then an extra step is necessary to turn that into *anattā.* Actually seeing suffering means seeing not-self right then and there, simultaneously.

    For as long as *sakkāyadiṭṭhi* is there, the suffering inherent in phenomena has not been recognized.

    >For one who sees in what way, Bhante, is personality-view abandoned?

    >Bhikkhu, for one who sees the eye as suffering, personality-view is abandoned. For one who sees forms as suffering, personality-view is abandoned. For one who sees eye-consciousness as suffering, personality-view is abandoned. For one who sees eye-contact as suffering, personality-view is abandoned ... for one who sees whatever feeling—pleasant, unpleasant or neither—that comes with mind-pressure as suffering, personality-view is abandoned.

    —SN 35.166

    So the way out of the problem is to not take one's current view of what suffering is for granted and then try to look for something else that's missing, but to realize and get oneself to thoroughly admit that it's that very view, right as it may appear,  that is the problem. Not doing that means starting off on the wrong foot—building on top of one's current understanding instead of demolishing the whole edifice which precisely makes one a puthujjana.

### Assuming Right View

Whenever I see that I am taking something for granted, it's obvious that that thing was not included within the aggregates for as long as I was taking it for granted. Now that it is recognized, it is automatically of the aggregates. Is this what Ajahn Nyanamoli means when I hear him say that assumption is not in the aggregates?

I ask, because I don't see how Right View could be anything but an assumption, because as soon as it is recognized it would necessarily be of the aggregates, subjected to change.

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/19c5mpd/assuming_right_view/kj0vn3o/)** _2024-01-22 10:43:50_:

    >Whenever I see that I am taking something for granted, it's obvious that that thing was not included within the aggregates for as long as I was taking it for granted. Now that it is recognized, it is automatically of the aggregates. Is this what Ajahn Nyanamoli means when I hear him say that assumption is not in the aggregates?

    There is some validity in what you're referring to here. Assumption or upādāna always occurs because certain things are being gratuitously regarded as outside of the aggregates. But the thing is, precisely because things can *always* be recognized as primordially being within the aggregates that this is the "right order" of how things actually are. Meaning, it never could have *actually* been "outside", so it's not like "now that you recognized it" it became so.

    For example, giving in to sensuality can only be done by assuming the pressure or desire to act out as coming "first" and the experience of the pleasant object "second" (not "first" or "second" temporally, but in the sense of what is given *priority*). Thus,  the assumption of sensuality is eventually undone by seeing that no matter how much pressure there is to pursue some pleasant object, that pressure is *second* to the experience of the pleasant object which arose on its own (the aggregates); it cannot be there without it.

    So yes, in this case the one who is not free from sensuality will automatically experience that pressure as if it's "outside" of the aggregates, which is exactly why they will feel justified to act out of it. By repeatedly seeing that no matter how "outside" it feels, it still *has* to be within the aggregates, one is gradually restoring the right order, "wearing away" the assumption. And for this, one needs to be able to endure the pressure and not try to get rid of it, because craving against the discomfort of the pressure is precisely why the assumption (that there is an "outside" of it) is there ("with craving, assumption is").

    >I ask, because I don't see how Right View could be anything but an assumption, because as soon as it is recognized it would necessarily be of the aggregates, subjected to change.

    There is some truth to this as well, but not in the sense that you're suggesting. It's true in the sense that for a puthujjana, it's impossible to even *conceive* of a view that would be anything but another assumption—otherwise they would not be a puthujjana.

    But the Right View of sotāpanna is not a view in the way that a puthujjana knows views (which is always through their *diṭṭhi-upādāna*); it would be more correct to think that the Right View is the understanding of ***all*** views that makes assuming any view impossible. And that bears repeating: it's an *understanding* that makes one incapable of assuming views whether one tries to have views or not; it's not a *choice* of "I will not hold any views" or "I believe there is no self", because *that's* a view that one would assume in exactly the same manner as "the self is eternal", etc. They're different only in their *content*, , and that's all most people can see, not their nature of being assumed.

    Thus, not having the Right View means that *whatever* view one has will be wrong; it will still be affected with assumption. Wrong view is simply the lack of the Right View/sotapatti; it's not something you can "fix" by just adopting another view, even if its extracted verbatim from the Suttas. If it were like that, then indeed the Right View would just be another assumption, and also be subject to change as you say (you would lose it if you forgot everything you know about the Dhamma even in this life, whereas the true Right View survives for up to 7 wholly new births).

### How to make the best out of a dark retreat?

Hello everyone!

I just found this community and am very glad I did because I have been following the teachings of Ajahn Nyanamoli for quite some time (although I don't think I haven't made any bigger progress on the path of gradual training) and it's good to know there is so many other people benefiting from it!

I would like to ask for any opinion regarding a "dark retreat". This is basically provided as a stay in a completely dark (and almost completely silent) room with basic stuff like bed, shower and a toilet, and food being brought in once a day (unless you opt in for a fast).

I have very limited possibilities regarding periods of seclusion in my householder life and last month I found out about these retreats being available not far from where I live, so I went ahead and booked a 7-day stay in the second week of February.

I'm planning to use this valuable - albeit arguably extreme - opportunity to do the hard work of observing the unpleasant state of mind caused by a lack of sensory stimulation. Ajahn Nyanamoli often talks about the boredom and subsequent existential dread that sets in when there is no distraction available. I think this setting would be the ideal opportunity to get a taste of that.

I would be very happy for any feedback on this endeavor, especially the following points:

* Is it okay to go head in and try this form of seclusion? I do have some experience with periods of seclusion, but not for very long and not this extreme.
* Is there any particular topic/teaching to keep in mind during this time to make the best use of this retreat? My current hope is that the lack of sensual stimulation would allow me to reach more transparency/honesty to realize subtler motives behind sensory craving. I would like to pursue sensory restraint in my daily life in much higher degree, but it's easy to slide back into sensuality without a deeper understanding of its causes.

I am prepared for discomfort and willing to do the hard work during my stay but at the same time I would like to clear out any misunderstanding, such as this not being particularly conducive to the goal I set for myself or to Dhamma practice in general.

Any insight/advice is very welcome. Thank you.

    >Is it okay to go head in and try this form of seclusion? I do have some experience with periods of seclusion, but not for very long and not this extreme.

    If you haven't been developing virtue and sense restraint to an impeccable degree beforehand, then the extent to which you manage to keep your sanity throughout that experience is the extent to which you're not actually "secluded" in the true sense, meaning you're still finding some form of distraction on some level (which would include "the practice" when done with subtle motivations affected with craving). Wholesome mental development (as opposed to mental instability) on account of solitude is only possible when the Gradual Training has been well adhered to.

    A much more effective first step toward[ true seclusion ](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.63/en/bodhi?lang=en&reference=none&highlight=false)would be to address the shortcomings in your restraint that you're already aware of. Abandoning the ways in which you still delight in the pleasures that you encounter in your everyday life. That's what sense *restraint* is; sense *deprivation* is something else altogether, and the Buddha never encouraged that. Generally nowadays, "meditation" retreats and such are about the latter rather than the former, which is why the whole concept is utterly flawed.

    > Suppose there were a wet sappy piece of wood lying in water, and a man came with an upper fire-stick, thinking: ‘I shall light a fire, I shall produce heat.’ What do you think, Aggivessana? Could the man light a fire and produce heat by taking the upper fire-stick and rubbing it against the wet sappy piece of wood lying in the water?”

    >“No, Master Gotama. Why not? Because it is a wet sappy piece of wood, and it is lying in water. Eventually the man would reap only weariness and disappointment.”

    >“So too, Aggivessana, as to those recluses and brahmins who still do not live bodily withdrawn from sensual pleasures, and whose sensual desire, affection, infatuation, thirst, and fever for sensual pleasures has not been fully abandoned and suppressed internally, even if those good recluses and brahmins feel painful, racking, piercing feelings due to exertion, they are incapable of knowledge and vision and supreme enlightenment; and even if those good recluses and brahmins do not feel painful, racking, piercing feelings due to exertion, they are incapable of knowledge and vision and supreme enlightenment. This was the first simile that occurred to me spontaneously, never heard before.

    —MN 36

    If you put the sticks next to a bonfire for a few days to dry ASAP only to get them just as wet as they were before, it's basically as if you didn't do anything at all.

    >Is there any particular topic/teaching to keep in mind during this time to make the best use of this retreat? My current hope is that the lack of sensual stimulation would allow me to reach more transparency/honesty to realize subtler motives behind sensory craving. I would like to pursue sensory restraint in my daily life in much higher degree, but it's easy to slide back into sensuality without a deeper understanding of its causes.

    It's a common view that when this sort of thing is over with you'll have a greater understanding of your own mind, most popularly with the help of the mindless repetition of some meditation technique. But even if that's not involved at all, it's still a misunderstanding of how the "dust in one's eyes" that prevents one from recognizing one's craving is to be cleared up.

    The development of the mind can only take place when, to use an analogy, you were used to hiking with 5kg on your back and now you commit to carrying an extra 5-10kg ***every single day, 24/7*** ***with no "breaks" whatsoever,*** rather than when you take on 20kg for several hours only to go back to 5kg in the end.

    That is to say, you would become clearer about what craving is by taking on a greater but less extreme amount of renunciation but *for the rest of your life.* Becoming celibate, for example.

    If the thought of that scares you more than doing this retreat, it's a testament to how *that's* what would actually "hit the spot" and force you to face your true demons, whereas this superficially seemingly greater amount of renunciation is not really challenging the mind's attachments because it knows it will go back to the status quo at *some* point.

### Pleasant enclosed within the unpleasant

I was listening to a talk earlier, and thinking and pondering about how it applies. But I thought it might be an interesting discussion point since a brief search didn't show up many exact results.

Am I considering things on the right track, *or* to what extent am I wrong:  
Whenever I am pressured by a thought, for example: '*there is this game I could play, that would be pleasant, it would be my escape from this other feeling'* the viewing of that idea, that thought as pleasant, and delighting in it *is* the gratification. The mechanism by which it is not seen as dangerous, is the failure to see that it is enclosed within the unpleasantness of the pressure, which is present at the same time. For me as a putthujana, there's already suffering there, at the same time. And the danger, is in the selective attention to the pleasant, and the delight, whereby passion is strengthened, and *things for me* is strengthened/maintained.

Keen to hear thoughts.

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/198e27i/pleasant_enclosed_within_the_unpleasant/kibewmc/)** _2024-01-17 18:38:58_:

    >the viewing of that idea, that thought as pleasant, and delighting in it *is* the gratification. 

    Not exactly.

    > '*there is this game I could play,* ***that would be pleasant,*** *it would be my escape from this other feeling*

    *That* is the gratification.

    >The pleasure and happiness that arise on account of these five kinds of sensual stimulation: this is the gratification of sensual pleasures.

    —MN 13

    >“Bhikkhus, (1) if there were no gratification in the world, beings would not become enamored of it; but because there is gratification in the world, beings become enamored of it. (2) If there were no danger in the world, beings would not become disenchanted with it; but because there is danger in the world, beings become disenchanted with it. (3) If there were no escape from the world, beings would not escape from it; but because there is an escape from the world, beings escape from it.

    —AN 3.105

    The pleasure derived from sensuality is real, and your renunciation will be imperfect (though still much preferrable to indulgence of course) if you try to deny that to stop yourself from wanting it. That's pretty much inevitable in the beginning, but one must be clear that that's still not the middle way.

    >and the danger, is in the selective attention to the pleasant, and the delight, whereby passion is strengthened, and *things for me* is strengthened/maintained.

    Sense pleasures are dangerous ***because*** they are so very delightful, plain and simple, not because such and such happens when you attend to it like this or like that. If your perception of danger depends on ceasing to acknowledge the agreeability of something, it's not anymore a sense *pleasure* whose nature you are recognizing.

    When the danger of sensuality is known on the right level, the more pleasant feelings something arouses, the sharper the perception of danger is, simultaneously and to the same extent. That's when there is no need to suppress or run away from any feelings that arise (apart from not breaking the precepts and basic sense restraint), because when sense pleasure suggests itself to the mind, no matter to what extent, it *brings with it* the recognition of danger, and that right there is the escape which requires you to "do" nothing whatsoever.

    And that is how you genuinely start to see *the same phenomenon* as a "charcoal pit", as a [very tasty but poisonous drink,](https://suttacentral.net/sn12.66/en/bodhi?lang=en&reference=none&highlight=false) instead of (inadvertently) altering the initial pleasure so that it's not *really* pleasure anymore.

    This is exactly why virtue and sense restraint are absolutely indispensable for this acute and liberating recognition to even be possible: if your behavior is not well purified way beforehand so that no matter how much pressure arises, you never act out of it, you won't be able to have the full extent of sensual gratification vis-à-vis without yielding to the actions it pushes you to make—and as soon as the pressure turns into action, any perception of its danger, let alone realization of the escape is impossible.

    Edit: There's a [talk ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ttVxzlzlj0)on this topic, and a [transcript](https://pathpress.org/not-wanting-the-wanting/).

### Any known list of suttas finishing with the arising of right view?

Hello, everyone! Does anyone know of a list/compilation of suttas in which the listener develops right view by the end of it?

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/197fxsp/any_known_list_of_suttas_finishing_with_the/ki35asn/)** _2024-01-16 05:45:12_:

    [This](https://suttacentral.net/search?query=dhammacakkh) should show all instances.

    It wasn't part of the question, but it's a good opportunity to point out the following (which was the topic of [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2AWxZnxeYk)):

    It will become apparent that a specific pattern recurs throughout all of these instances

    >Then the Blessed One gave Sīha the general a progressive discourse, that is, a talk on giving, virtuous behavior, and heaven; ***he revealed the danger, degradation, and defilement of sensuality and the benefit of renunciation. When the Blessed One knew that Sīha’s mind was pliant, softened, rid of hindrances, uplifted, and confident,*** he revealed that Dhamma teaching special to the Buddhas: suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path. Then, just as a clean cloth rid of dark spots would readily absorb dye, so too, while Sīha the general sat in that same seat, there arose in him the dust-free, stainless Dhamma-eye: ‘Whatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessation.’

    What enabled these people to see the Four Noble Truths was *not* what is generally thought of as the forerunner of supramundane insight ("concentration"). It was a joyful state of mind on account of *dispassion for sensuality,* born of nothing but recognizing its inherent danger, and seeing its relinquishment as peaceful.

    &#x200B;

    >“Honorable Ānanda, we are laypeople who enjoy sensual pleasures. ***We like sensual pleasures, we love them and take joy in them. But renunciation seems like an abyss.*** I have heard that in this teaching and training there are very young mendicants whose minds are secure in renunciation; they’re confident, settled, and decided about it. They see it as peaceful. Renunciation is the dividing line between the multitude and the mendicants in this teaching and training.”  
    >  
    >\[...\]  
    >  
    >Before my awakening—when I was still unawakened but intent on awakening—I too thought, ‘Renunciation is good! Seclusion is good!’ ***But my mind wasn’t secure in renunciation; it wasn’t confident, settled, and decided about it. I didn’t see it as peaceful.*** Then I thought, ‘What is the cause, what is the reason why my mind isn’t secure in renunciation, and not confident, settled, and decided about it? Why don’t I see it as peaceful?’ Then I thought, ‘I haven’t seen the danger of sensual pleasures, and so I haven’t cultivated that. I haven’t realized the benefits of renunciation, and so I haven’t developed that. That’s why my mind isn’t secure in renunciation, and not confident, settled, and decided about it. And it’s why I don’t see it as peaceful.’ Then I thought, ‘Suppose that, seeing the drawbacks of sensual pleasures, I were to cultivate that. And suppose that, realizing the benefits of renunciation, I were to develop that. It’s possible that my mind would become secure in renunciation; it would be confident, settled, and decided about it. And I would see it as peaceful.’ And so, after some time, I saw the drawbacks of sensual pleasures and cultivated that, and I realized the benefits of renunciation and developed that. Then my mind became secure in renunciation; it was confident, settled, and decided about it. I saw it as peaceful.  
    >  
    >Quite separated from sense desires, separated from unbeneficial qualities, with thinking and with pondering, with joy and ease born of separation, I dwelt having entered the first jhāna.

    —AN 9.41

    This is a very different type of joy than that of sensuality, which is the same joy that comes from meditation for most people. **The joy of sensuality is self-contained**: it's pleasant because it's pleasant, period. Whether it's sexual intercourse, delicious food, or the blissful states that result from breath observation or any other techniques, both of them have in common that they simply "feel good".

    Contemporary meditation practices provide a source of pleasure that doesn't in itself demand renunciation. It is required only to the extent that the overt pursuit of worldly pleasures disrupts the sheltered setting necessary to craft the artificial mental space you want, which is what provides a temporary escape from suffering. From their point of view, sensuality must be abandoned because it's a "distraction" to this *other* pursuit, not because its intrinsic danger has been internalized; much like drugs and partying are easily forgone when you really want to focus on making money and "self-improvement" instead. And this is why, for those who enjoy sensual pleasures, this type of pleasure does *not* "seem like an abyss", and they juggle between their meditation practices and sensual engagements as if they're perfectly compatible—sometimes reinforcing each other, even.

    The pleasure of renunciation, on the other hand, is born of the *relief* of having given up something that was not for one's benefit (and thus it is inextricably tied with understanding things as they are). It is not pleasant ***because of*** ***itself*** unlike sensual pleasure, but because of a value judgment that determines what has been abandoned as absolutely undesirable ("good riddance"). This is exactly why this pleasure *begins* as pain: how it will be felt is solely determined by the current value judgment, which is in favor sensuality and the world by default.

    >"Forms, sounds, tastes, scents, bodily contacts and ideas which are agreeable, pleasant and charming, all these, while they last, are deemed to be happiness by the world with its devas. But when they cease, that is agreed by all to be unsatisfactory. By the Noble Ones, the cessation of ownership is seen as happiness. This is the reverse of the outlook of the whole world.

    —Suttanipāta 3.12

    The way to work towards this is joy of renunciation is, unsurprisingly, getting used to renunciation—virtue and sense restraint. The point must be reached where that which initially felt "like an abyss" as said in the Sutta above, is now a source of joy. The extent to which there are things that are "too dear to be given up", is the extent to which the mind is not confident in renunciation, and to which, to use the same simile, the cloth will not take the "dye" because it's soiled.

    >Firstly, a bhikkhu has not dispelled passion, desire, fondness, thirst, burning, and craving for sense pleasures. This being so, his mind doesn’t incline to ardency, dedication, persistence, and striving. This is the first shackle of mind he hasn’t cut off.  
    >  
    >\[...\]  
    >  
    >When a bhikkhu has not given up these five obstinacies and cut off these five shackles of mind, it’s impossible for him to achieve growth, improvement, or maturity in this teaching and training.

    —MN 16

    Laypeople back in the day did not have to go through this development because, as is clear from the texts, all it took for their minds to reach that pliable state was *hearing* about the danger of sensuality (this is what it means to have ["little dust in one's eyes")](https://suttacentral.net/sn6.1/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin). Their minds were thus able to regard renunciation as pleasant even though they were probably not even keeping the precepts before encountering the Buddha.

    Nowadays, on the other hand, when the giving up of worldly pleasures and attachments is talked about to most of us, let alone undertaken, the opposite of joy is the result. It is therefore necessary to *live out* renunciation as much as possible until ***that same*** "missing out" on things—which initially gave rise to anguish—becomes the greatest and only worthwhile source of happiness, independent of anything at all except continuing to "miss out", for if were to hinge on doing this or that \[practice\], it would just be another mundane pleasure.

    At that point, how the absence of craving is the ending of suffering is being experienced firsthand, and there is no way *not* to see the Four Noble Truths if one knows them intellectually—that's how knowledge would cease to be merely intellectual, not by having a "transcendental meditative experience that you can't put into words", of which there was never any mention whatsoever before stream entry in the Suttas, and there is no reason to believe that these people, like General Sīha in AN 8.12 or [King Bimbisāra and his ministers](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/brahmali?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=main&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin#22.1.1), very busy men, were engaging in what today is generally regarded as cultivation of the mind, let alone that it was what enabled their breakthrough.

### Understanding not-self in not-self

After learning that the aggregates were there on their own for that sense of self to be there, I started thinking this body and this mind aren't mine, but rather that "I" is theirs.

But I also learned from Ajahn Nyanamoli that one should see "not-self in not self" and not "self in not self", and at the light of the Puṇṇamasutta or Mūlapariyāyasutta for example, I'm thinking what I expressed in the previous line might be wrong view also.

[Puṇṇamasutta SN 22.82:](https://suttacentral.net/sn22.82/en/bodhi)

>Here, bhikkhu, the uninstructed worldling, who is not a seer of the noble ones and is unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma, who is not a seer of superior persons and is unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma, regards form as self, or self as possessing form, or form as in self, or self as in form. He regards feeling as self … perception as self … volitional formations as self … consciousness as self, or self as possessing consciousness, or consciousness as in self, or self as in consciousness. That is how identity view comes to be.

[Mūlapariyāyasutta MN 1:](https://suttacentral.net/mn1/en/bodhi)

>He perceives the sensed as the sensed. Having perceived the sensed as the sensed, he conceives himself as the sensed, he conceives himself in the sensed, he conceives himself apart from the sensed, he conceives the sensed to be ‘mine,’ he delights in the sensed. Why is that? Because he has not fully understood it, I say.  
>  
>He perceives the cognized as the cognized. Having perceived the cognized as the cognized, he conceives himself as the cognized, he conceives himself in the cognized, he conceives himself apart from the cognized, he conceives the cognized to be ‘mine,’ he delights in the cognized. Why is that? Because he has not fully understood it, I say.

There is seeing "in not self" which are the aggregates that are their on their own, but then there also is a need to not see the I-element in this not-self, or otherwise it would be seeing self in not-self, it would be attavada, right? Even if this is only a sense of self?

So is it wrong to think that because there are those aggregates that were already there on their own, that's why this sense of self arose, in the sense that it is "generated" by those aggregates that come together and are "working" together? I feel like this is not seeing "self in \[aggregate\]" but rather "because aggregates, sense of self", or "self in the sensed/cognized" but rather "because sensed/cognized are there, sense of self is there".

    >It will be clear that when there is avijjā there is avijjā in both parts of our experience, the immediate and the reflexive; for though, in reflexion, experience is divided within itself, it is still one single, even if complex, structure. The effect of this may be seen from the Sabbāsavasutta (Majjhima i,2 <M.i,8>) wherein certain wrong views are spoken of. Three of them are: Attanā va attānam sañjānāmī ti; Attanā va anattānam sañjānāmī ti; and Anattanā va attānam sañjānāmī ti. ('With self I perceive self; With self I perceive not-self; With not-self I perceive self.')  
    >  
    >A man with avijjā, practising reflexion, may identify 'self' with both reflexive and immediate experience, or with reflexive experience alone, or with immediate experience alone. He does not conclude that neither is 'self', and the reason is clear: it is not possible to get outside avijjā by means of reflexion alone; ***for however much a man may 'step back' from himself to observe himself he cannot help taking avijjā with him. There is just as much avijjā in the self-observer as there is in the self-observed.***

In order to put an end to avijjā, which is a matter of recognizing avijjā as avijjā, it is necessary to accept on trust from the Buddha a Teaching that contradicts the direct evidence of the puthujjana's reflexion.  
    >  
    >\[...\]  
    >  
    >Thus it will be seen that avijjā in reflexive experience (actual or potential) is the condition for avijjā in immediate experience. It is possible, also, to take a second step back and reflect upon reflexion; but there is still avijjā in this self-observation of self-observation, and we have a third layer of avijjā protecting the first two. And there is no reason in theory why we should stop here; ***but however far we go we shall not get beyond avijjā.***  
    >  
    >Avijjā is non-knowledge of the four noble truths. Sammāditthi is knowledge of the four noble truths. But sammāditthi is part of the four noble truths. Thus avijjā is non-knowledge of sammāditthi; that is to say, non-knowledge of knowledge of the four noble truths. But since sammāditthi, which is knowledge of the four noble truths, is part of the four noble truths, so avijjā is non-knowledge of knowledge of knowledge of the four noble truths. And so we can go on indefinitely. But the point to be noted is that each of these successive stages represents an additional layer of (potentially) reflexive avijjā. Non-knowledge of knowledge of the four noble truths is non-knowledge of vijjā, and non-knowledge of vijjā is failure to recognize avijjā as avijjā. Conversely, it is evident that when avijjā is ***once recognized anywhere in this structure it must vanish everywhere;*** for knowledge of the four noble truths entails knowledge of knowledge of the four noble truths, and vijjā ('science') replaces avijjā ('nescience') throughout.\[n\]

    —§25, A Note on Paṭiccasamuppāda, Ñāṇavīra Thera

    >But I also learned from Ajahn Nyanamoli that one should see "not-self in not self" and not "self in not self"

    Therefore, it's not like one "should see not-self with not-self", as if it's a matter of choice. One needs to start by recognizing that one is by definition unable to do that until one is a sotāpanna. Acknowledging that is the only way to have a chance to see what "self" actually is.

    Otherwise, one is automatically taking one's present conception of the problem for granted, even if one is approaching it through the Suttas on paper. That means that whatever is seen to be "not-self" will still involve a subtler form of ownership that manages to elude one's insufficient threshold of recognition for what "self" is.

    The "regarding" and "conceiving" referred to in the Suttas you quoted are not at all something that can simply be figured out and then stopped. Rather, any attempt to figure out how to stop it is happening within the experience that is on some level regarded as self right then and there.

    The only direct choice one can make that could eventually make the sense of self apparent is that of not acting out of hindrances when they are recognized to be the motivation behind one's action, in this case the attempt to figure out the principle in question.

### Question regarding right and the wrong interpretations of mindfulness, according Nyanamoli.

I recently read *The only way to Jhana*, and found it really useful in order to further appreciate the whole teachings Buddha asked us to commit in order to attain right view.

So, I have been reading a bit about the interpretations of Nyanamoli on the suttas, specially on how  to practice meditation. It's quite clear that he regards most of nowadays Buddhism meditation techniques as not being aligned with Buddha's teaching for the main reason of not getting right what Buddha meant by mindfulness.

Yet, I fail to see the why such meditation techniques are wrong in their understanding mindfulness (according Nyanamoli view). From its Peripheral Awareness, we've got this description of right mindfulness

>We  need to stress that this is something that requires development. It’s  not something that can be just “figured out”, or read once and made  sense of. It requires a diligent repetition of "stepping back" when  over-attending one's experience as a whole. And then "stepping in" when  ignoring it (under-attending it, forgetting about the background). So,  it takes time and effort in order for it to be correctly discerned and  recognized.  
>  
>The problem with common  practice of meditation is that people are encouraged to get “absorbed”  into the particular “meditation object”. The practice becomes a form of  focusing on the foreground at the expense of everything else. And not  just that, people end up focusing on the objects twice as hard. This is  because their view of meditation is to look and perceive the “momentary”  foreground (the whole idea of "observing 'sensations'"). Then within  that they try to perceive even more particular things. So it’s not just  the  domain of the foreground, but the content proliferates further too.  In cases like this, the ‘background’, as a foundation of mindfulness  that needs to be understood, is even further obscured  
>  
>\[...\] this  type of mindfulness of the background that's simultaneous with the  presently arisen phenomenon, results in the establishment of mind.

For instance, in the anapana method taught by Goenka (my only experience with Buddhism-tagged meditation), one is asked to follow the breath and be aware of the touch of the breath in the area around the nostrils.

\[This meditation is not what it is described in the anapanasati sutta. Yet,\] In such meditation, isn't the breath the background/anchor we are asked not to lose sight of, while the particulars sensations of the breath is the foreground/arisen phenomenon we are asked to contemplate upon, while not reacting, not classifying them according our tastes, and so on.

Why such meditation (and other similars) are not the right mindfulness? As per my understanding, it fits into Nyanamoli right mindfulness definition and description. What I am missing?

    >Why such meditation (and other similars) are not the right mindfulness? As per my understanding, it fits into Nyanamoli right mindfulness definition and description. What I am missing?

    &#x200B;

    Under that Buddha's own definition, meditation (bhāvanā), be it Anapanasati or anything else is the cultivation of the 7 enlightenment factors, and [these exist only for a stream-enterer.](https://suttacentral.net/sn46.30/en/sujato?lang=en)

    So in the end, the problem is not ***what*** a person is practicing per se. The point is not that if you do AN's "method" instead, you will be practicing properly. If only it were that easy.

    Meditation is the further development of the cessation of suffering that person has already understood. Thus, if they don't see the cessation of suffering, it follows that whatever meditation they're doing will be about something else (managing\*,\* running away from suffering, or getting a separate pleasure to cancel it out). Whether or not they regard it to be in line with the Four Noble Truths or not is not a valid criterion, because the point is that they haven't seen those truths yet to begin with. In fact, an attempt to cultivate the 7 enlightenment factors when one still hasn't understood what enlightenment entails taking one's current idea of what enlightenment and suffering are for granted.

    And that is really the issue. Anyone can do as many meditation techniques as they like, but for their own benefit, they shouldn't confuse that with the Buddha's teaching, because they will then not make the effort to find out what the Dhamma is. They will instead be obtaining various pleasant experiences and emotional reinforcement out of doing exactly what they've been doing before they took up the practice: seeking pleasure and shying away from displeasure. A noble disciple, on the other hand, meditates by *abandoning craving,* because they know and see what that is (and again, anyone can *think* that's what they're doing, but that's where self-honesty about one's level of development comes in; if one truly has understood what craving is, one should be able to not suffer regardless of whether one meditates or not, in any situation whatsoever).

    So what a person should do is not turn Ajahn Nyanamoli's instructions into another technique that they blindly follow, but strive to see for themselves what suffering is and the way out of it, and what wholesome is and why it is so, and what unwholesome is and why it is so. Only when that is seen internally beyond doubt is one able to abandon unwholesome states, which is what meditation is.

    >“There are, mendicants, these two powers. What two? The power of reflection and the power of development. And what, mendicants, is the power of reflection? It’s when someone reflects: ‘Bad conduct of body, speech, or mind has a bad, painful result in both this life and the next.’ Reflecting like this, they give up bad conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, and develop good conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, keeping themselves pure. This is called the power of reflection. *\[this is what a person can do, so as to eventually partake in the below:\]*

### Moderation in eating

Wonder what everyone's thoughts on this matter are.  


As a non-monastic, who is keen to be virtuous. It has always struck me as a bit unnecessary that someone trying to keep 'eight' precepts at home should only eat before afternoon 'at the proper time'. Is there any functional reason why I couldn't obtain the same benefits having say lunch and dinner, or breakfast and dinner (but nothing in between)?  


It strikes me, that the timing is not all that important (in fact as a person living at home, I cannot see how it could be). But rather, the moderation aspect is what is important, and even more fundamentally, to not eat for pleasure. Then again, maybe I'm just trying to bargain with myself, because it is more convenient for me on some days to have an evening meal than a lunch, or because I do not have time for breakfast or a midday meal on some days.  


I fully admit, I don't understand what is correct here. So keen to get some advice.

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/196a1us/moderation_in_eating/khss3hl/)** _2024-01-14 10:33:06_:

    >But rather, the moderation aspect is what is important, and even more fundamentally, to not eat for pleasure.

    Yes, that's it. The custom of eating in the morning was shaped mainly by the environmental circumstances of the early Saṅgha. There are some practical benefits of doing it that way though, such as not having to think about food for the rest of the day. There might be some physiological benefits to it as well.

    But ultimately, the most important thing is that at each meal is regarded as if it were one's only child on the plate, and the [sole purpose of eating it is to survive—no enjoyment sought from it whatsoever](https://suttacentral.net/sn12.63/en/bodhi?lang=en).

    That attitude is much easier to establish (and the wrong attitudes easier to pick up on) when one eats only once a day. All the potential desire and wrong reasons for eating get concentrated into one moment, and if they're there at all, it will be impossible not to see them.

    Of course, there is also the aspect of simply putting up with physical discomfort, although that's only part of the picture, and that can be done for wrong reasons too. Otherwise, all-out fasting would be the recommendation.

    >“Now, bhikkhus, suppose that I had eaten, refused more, had my fill, finished, had enough, had what I needed, and some alms-food was left over to be thrown away. Then two bhikkhus arrived hungry and weak, and I told them: ‘Bhikkhus, I have eaten, refused more… had what I needed, but there is this alms-food of mine left over to be thrown away; eat if you like; if you do not then I shall throw it now where there is no greenery or drop into water where there is no life’; then one bhikkhu thought: ‘The Blessed One has eaten, refused more… had what he needed, but there is this alms-food of the Blessed One left over to be thrown away; if we do not eat it the Blessed One will throw it away… but this has been said by the Blessed One: “Bhikkhus, be my heirs in Dhamma, not my heirs in material things”: now this alms-food is one of the material things; suppose that instead of eating this alms-food I pass the night and day hungry and weak?’ and instead of eating that alms-food he passed that night and day hungry and weak; then the second bhikkhu thought: ‘The Blessed One has eaten… had what he needed, but there is this alms-food of the Blessed One’s left over to be thrown away… Suppose that I eat this alms-food and pass the night and day neither hungry nor weak?’ And after eating that alms-food he passed the night and day not hungry and weak. Now although that bhikkhu by eating that alms-food passed the night and day neither hungry nor weak, yet the first bhikkhu is more to be respected and commended by me. Why is that? Because that will for long conduce to his fewness of wishes, contentment, effacement, easy support and arousal of energy.

### Reflection on my personal hypocrisy

Before officially leaving a large portion of the internet for solitude and contemplation, I wanted to do a reflection first and get some advice here if possible.

I was pretty disappointed with my behavior in one post. I felt that the debate was getting too heated and aggressive, and that it would be beneficial if we could just stick to the Dhamma, so I created a post requesting if it'd be possible for the individuals to resort to DMs. But a poster rightly mentioned it wasn't my place to police speech, and if I recall correctly, they told me to reflect on why I want others to stop. This was correct so I deleted the request. But it's thanks to that person that this entire reflection is possible.

The uncompromising stance on virtue by the entire HH community and videos has been immensely helpful to me at all times; when I'm keeping virtue and when I'm not. I always knew I could turn to this community or the videos to be fired up and motivated with regards to keeping virtue. But to the extent I was relying on this community, or in fact, *anything,* my virtue would be, to that very same extent, *liable to change*. It's almost as if 'true' virtue has to go *beyond* phenomena; at which point, there is no longer any *doing* of virtue, rather, just being housed in it. This is at least what it feels like for the 5 + celibacy; I'm not *doing* them at all, they're just a natural abiding where I *know* stepping out of would just be for my own harm, though of course not having the right view, the recognition of the extent of the harm is questionable.

In the debate on pedagogy, it was this uncompromising stance on virtue that was at risk that I wanted to protect. And I felt that that put my very own virtue at risk, which was one among the many reasons for creating the post I deleted. But I after the poster (sorry, I wish I remembered their tag) told me to reflect on why I was requesting that, I realized, this is essentially the opposite of this attitude on a more general level:

>*Not* depending on one's family for happiness, i.e., emotional abandonment of one's family, one *does not* expect them to *be* thus, *not be* thus; having abandoned any such expectations pertaining to change that are just expectations pertaining to things-in-the-world being in accordance to how one wants, there cannot be anger, there cannot *not* be gratitude towards one's family for what they've done

Except, this is "depending on this group for one's virtue" one wishes for things-in-the-world to be thus, or not be thus. To the extent that dependence remains, there is desire, there is the *possibility* of anger and ill-will on account of not getting what *I* want. And ill-will was definitely one of the possibilities that could've occurred here had the debate persisted; there was a general irritable state of mind as the debate wasn't coming to a stop. Not only does the six-sense based body, i.e., the world, need abandonment, but there also needs to be abandonment of the dependence of virtue on anything but itself.

But I noticed this is clearly me being the very thing I was accusing others of: a hypocrite. I don't take a particular issue with this since I've made it clear to myself from the start, before the Dhamma, of my hypocrisy in life in general, and my inability to get out of that. Undoing hypocrisy and contradiction on the level of actions and undoing it on the level of one's theoretical system or understanding of the Dhamma are two very clearly different things. I've admitted so many times: the totality of my being is a contradiction, a hypocrisy. But I just can't seem to *ever* get out of it.

I distinctly remember far before my encounter with the Dhamma the nights of genuine despair encountering with epistemological nihilism -- the fact that I can't seem to arrive at any definitive knowledge about anything, and its implication that my entire way of being and world-view is possibly a contradiction with what is or could be 'right', but is beyond my reach. That still remains. But with the addition of actual nihilism that has remained implicit in my way of interaction with the world since I started getting mental and physical problems.

Although virtue is being kept itself, I just came to these set of behaviors before my encounter with the Dhamma through seeing how much harm breaking it caused. I still have a permeating sense of meaninglessness that prevents me from undertaking more than 5+CL for longer than a month. Or rather, a more precise way to put it: the sense of meaninglessness is my excuse for not undertaking virtue further. But this sense of meaninglessness is actually itself a contradiction -- a contradiction that encourages further hypocrisy in me. Why can this meaninglessness not be applied to not keeping virtue? Why is it that *keeping* virtue is meaningless, whilst *not keeping* virtue *isn't* meaningless? Why is there selectiveness?

There's a *huge* arsenal of excuses I use to prevent further development in virtue. Another big one is the fact that this minute development that I *have* made through encountering the Dhamma has already made me significantly incapable of suffering amidst things that would previously drive me to seriously contemplating suicide: pure OCD, chronic health problems that still persist, disagreements with others, consistently being alone, etc. Generally speaking, I've never been happier than this in my life, and keeping virtue robs me of that happiness, and so I ask myself "do I *really* need to keep this when I've already developed myself enough"?

But then I see posts such as this (putting aside pedagogical concerns of such kinds of writing):

>Not taking the teaching with any level of personal seriousness, avoiding making any significant modifications to one's lifestyle and worldview is simply the perpetual delaying and putting off of the only truly effectual work. "I will put an end to ignorance and craving...tomorrow." But for the coward, tomorrow never comes. A coward either dies to their cowardice *today*, or they live forever in hell. 

And all of a sudden, all sense of meaninglessness ceases, all questions of "do I *really* need to develop more?" cease, and this coward suddenly has the motivation to undertake all the precepts. But this is not everlasting. This is still virtue dependent on *something*, and that *something* will eventually come to an end; so will virtue, if it remains on it.

How does this coward develop virtue *not* dependent on anything? Where is there cessation of the inherently contradictory nihilism used to justify putting back development in virtue? Where is there cessation of the hypocrisy and contradictory nature of this coward? 

I wish development in virtue were as simple as the press of a button -- I would press it immediately.

    >  
    >I wish development in virtue were as simple as the press of a button -- I would press it immediately.

    That struggle, though it may not seem like it, is exactly where the development of the mind takes place.

    Rather than trying to summon up a sense of "courage" that will make the virtue easy, which can only be done by holding on to an external motivation for keeping the virtue ("oral transmission, linage, testament, canonical authority, logic, inference, reasoned contemplation, acceptance of a view after consideration, the appearance of competence, or the attitude 'This is our teacher'"—AN 3.65), it's about not breaking the precepts despite the trepidation that arises. Only then are you learning to truly ["be an island unto yourself".](https://youtu.be/qJMDsnQ79Cc?si=KtEq5reqM_6dSXPG)

    Trying to *get rid* of the mind's apprehension to the training instead of being heedful *in spite of it* means "not enduring things on the right level".

    Thus, a true "coward" and "hypocrite" in the ultimate sense is one who is keen to suppress their (mental state of) cowardice because it's unpleasant, instead of seeing it as something that has arisen on its own and that they should allow to persist without acting out of it. It's still the appropriation of an arisen phenomenon in the end, and it's a good example of how one can easily drift into denial and [self-mortification](https://youtu.be/-039SYi2a94?si=jEQPru_-RqnQg05n&t=496) in a subtle way, which is the natural, equally ignorant knee-jerk response to the remorse that comes from indulgence. It's "hypocritical" because one is displaying heedfulness and a "sharp" sense of urgency *on the surface* while deep down all of it is rooted in still resisting displeasure on a subtler level.

    Virtue ceases to depend on anything when one understands as it is that the entire mind (including its unwillingness to keep the virtue) does not belong to one, and *that*, as opposed to having the mind the way one wants, is the cessation of suffering. And the way to that is to keep the virtue strictly while enduring whatever the mind feels. The former is certainly not easy, but it can be achieved by a lot of people (and for the wrong reasons too); the latter is where the true pitfall lies.

    This passage essentially defines what qualifies as "early Buddhism" in HH teachings:

    >These books of the Pali Canon correctly represent the Buddha's Teaching, and can be regarded as trustworthy throughout. (Vinayapitaka:) Suttavibhanga, Mahāvagga, Cūlavagga; (Suttapitaka:) Dīghanikāya, Majjhimanikāya, Samyuttanikāya, Anguttaranikāya, Suttanipāta, Dhammapada, Udāna, Itivuttaka, Theratherīgāthā. (The Jātaka verses may be authentic, but they do not come within the scope of these Notes.) No other Pali books whatsoever should be taken as authoritative; and ignorance of them (and particularly of the traditional Commentaries) may be counted a positive advantage, as leaving less to be unlearned.

    —Notes on Dhamma, Ñāṇavīra Thera

    The list is widely agreed upon by modern scholars too. The Āgamas are also probably trustworthy, but the issue is there don't seem to be many English translations available, and the existing ones are likely to be biased. There is less room for scrutiny of translations compared to Pāli and its texts which have been studied extensively for over a hundred years.

### Craving for being and non-being

Hello, in [MN 9](https://suttacentral.net/mn9/en/bodhi) it is said:

>And what is the origin of suffering? It is craving, which brings renewal of being, is accompanied by delight and lust, and delights in this and that; that is, craving for sensual pleasures, craving for being, and craving for non-being. This is called the origin of suffering. 

Here, should one understand "craving for being, and craving for non-being" as only craving for *being* and *non-being*, or is it rather to be understood in the sense of craving for *being this*, or not *being that*, for example being smarter, or not being hypocritical?

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/193iqag/craving_for_being_and_nonbeing/khbswpb/)** _2024-01-11 06:09:05_:

    For a mind that is not free from sensuality, wanting to be this or not wanting to be that, which many people might take *not* to be sensual craving but the other two, is accompanied by the same type of craving that would be there toward coarse sense pleasures. *Every* single experience they have is enveloped within that.

    On the other hand, for a mind that is free from sensuality, an intention-toward or intention-against the same things (excluding sexual intercourse and food) would be accompanied by craving for being or for non-being. For an Arahant, an intention-toward or intention-against the same things, excluding what is against celibacy and the precepts which they are incapable of, does not entail any craving at all.

    For example, even things like the wish for others to respect them and not despise them would come within sensuality for a puthujjana, whereas for an anāgāmi, that *same intention* would always be the subtler type of craving for being and non-being, which is why the suffering they would experience on account of that vastly subtler craving is practically nil. So it's not, as is widely viewed, that some intentions are *in themselves* sensual (apart from what is abandoned through the precepts) and some are the other two, and that as a puthujjana you can have either one or the other. That would be the quintessential mistake of placing the defilements in the experiences rather than the mind beneath them. The defiled mind of one still subject to sensual craving follows every experience like a wheel follows the ox's foot (Dhammapada 1).

    In the end, sensual craving is what *makes you human*. That's why the one who is free from that never returns to this world (the literal meaning of "anāgāmi").

    So instead of trying to abstractly conceive what the two other types of craving are, one must strive to abandon one's human way of existing (kāmabhava). One will then realize, *if* one is not an Arahant already, that there is a very refined form of non-indifference left, meaning craving for phenomena to be or not to be (or, alternatively, in terms of bhava instead of taṇhā, material being and immaterial being).

    Edit: Life and death, often taken to be being and non-being, are in themselves phenomena, so that's only one of the things an anāgāmi would crave for or against respectively (though every other desire would be subordinate to that). For a puthujjana, the desire to live and not die is necessarily a sensual desire, and thus they experience that much more anxiety in the face of death, and that much more suffering when death actually comes.

### How to understand Ven. Ñānavīra on PS in light of SN 12.2?

Ven Ñānavīra has a unique interpretation of PS that has been very influential, especially in the HH teachings. He rejects that jāti in the PS formula refers to rebirth, as the Theravāda tradition has classically understood it, and instead asserts it simply means birth. He explains the implications of this in his “Notes on Dhamma,” writing:

“The puthujjana knows that people are born and die; and since he thinks 'my self exists' so he also thinks 'my self was born' and 'my self will die'. The puthujjana sees a 'self' to whom the words birth and death apply.[d] In contrast to the puthujjana, the arahat has altogether got rid of asmimāna (not to speak of attavāda—see MAMA), and does not even think 'I am'. This is bhavanirodha, cessation of being. And since he does not think 'I am' he also does not think 'I was born' or 'I shall die'. In other words, he sees no 'self' or even 'I' for the words birth and death to apply to.”

Thus, the cessation of these nidānā refer not to the cessation of literal birth and death, but rather the cessation of the attavāda which leads one to the view that they have a self which is subject to birth and death.

However, when we turn to the suttas, in the Paṭiccasamuppādavibhaṅgasutta we find a description of jāti and jarāmarana that seemingly describes quite literal birth, aging and death:

“And what, bhikkhus, is aging-and-death? The aging of the various beings in the various orders of beings, their growing old, brokenness of teeth, greyness of hair, wrinkling of skin, decline of vitality, degeneration of the faculties: this is called aging. The passing away of the various beings from the various orders of beings, their perishing, breakup, disappearance, mortality, death, completion of time, the breakup of the aggregates, the laying down of the carcass: this is called death. Thus this aging and this death are together called aging-and-death.

And what, bhikkhus, is birth? The birth of the various beings into the various orders of beings, their being born, descent into the womb, production, the manifestation of the aggregates, the obtaining of the sense bases. This is called birth.”

Vibhanga suttas such as this aim to definitively clarify the main terms of their subject. So, these descriptions should be viewed as quite significant and central to our understanding of PS. However, the seem difficult to rectify with Ven Ñānavīra’s interpretation of PS as they describe literal birth and death rather than the view of having a self which is susceptible to birth and death, as Ñānavīra claims.

I would greatly appreciate the help of those in this community who have greater knowledge and understanding of these matters than me in clarifying how to rectify these two texts. 

My thanks 🙏🙏🙏

    >Thus, the cessation of these nidānā refer not to the cessation of literal birth and death, but rather the cessation of the attavāda which leads one to the view that they have a self which is subject to birth and death.

    The starting point must be to not think that because this "makes sense", one is in a position to either accept or reject what Ñāṇavīra is describing. At the starting point of ignorance, when one hears the expression "cessation of the view that there is a self \[to whom birth and death apply\]", one is inevitably interpreting it through annihilationism (SN 12.15). It is impossible to even conceive what "cessation of self view" means without having understood *paṭiccasamuppāda* and having the Right View. For a puthujjana, cessation of attavāda is always necessarily misconceived as cessation of some kind of form, feeling, perception, intention, or consciousness, and never seen rightly as the cessation of *upādāna* regarding the aggregates (MN 109).

    &#x200B;

    >“But sir, is assumption (*upadāna)* the exact same thing as the five assumed aggregates? Or is assumption one thing and the five assumed aggregates another?”  
    >  
    >“Neither. Rather, the delight and passion for the five assumed aggregates is the assumption there.”

    —MN 109

    What this means is that it's more accurate as a puthujjana to think that the exact same birth and death one knows are still there when there is no self-view. But the free from self-view is not yoked, through their own misconceiving and ignorance, to that to which that same birth and death inevitably apply. Thus, they are not yoked to the suffering inherent in having been born and in dying, not that those things don't *exist* anymore or that they are now somehow pleasant.

    &#x200B;

    >If they feel a pleasant feeling, they feel it unyoked.  
    >  
    >If they feel an unpleasant feeling, they feel it unyoked.  
    >  
    >If they feel a neither-unpleasant-nor-pleasant feeling, they feel it unyoked.  
    >  
    >This is called a trained noble disciple who is unyoked from birth, old age, and death, from sorrows, lamentations, pains, dissatisfactions, and tribulations; who is unyoked from suffering, I say.

    —SN 36.6

    &#x200B;

    >Vibhanga suttas such as this aim to definitively clarify the main terms of their subject. So, these descriptions should be viewed as quite significant and central to our understanding of PS. However, the seem difficult to rectify with Ven Ñānavīra’s interpretation of PS as they describe literal birth and death rather than the view of having a self which is susceptible to birth and death, as Ñānavīra claims.

    They seem contradictory only when Ñāṇavīra's points are misinterpreted.

    Those passages are very well describing the phenomena of birth, aging, and death that a noble disciple is no longer subject to. Birth *is* the "descent into the womb, manifestation of the aggregates, etc.", and one who sees the Dhamma is not *subject* to that (is "unyoked" from it as above) even though their birth (together with it's inseparable liability to aging and death) is still there being *experienced.*

    And of course, they will experience even more births, agings, and deaths if they don't become an Arahant in this life. but none of that they are "yoked" to unlike the puthujjana who does have self view, who does wail and lament when the aggregates change in undesirable ways (SN 22.1).

    Ñāṇavīra's interpretation does not reject the wider context that applies across multiple lives—it *includes* it, and the application across multiple lives (which is still very different from the "three-life interpretation") remains secondary to the actual principle, which is independent of time.

    That is very different from saying that Ñāṇavīra's PS *only* applies to the present life like some sort of secular Buddhism, which is how it's often misapprehended.

### Where is the suffering

Scenario: 
I’m having a discussion with a person and they say something that upsets me. 
1. I am angry.
2. The interaction is displeasing.
3. I am suffering.

Questions:
1. Where is the anger? Where is the unpleasantness? Where is the suffering?
2. How would having Yoniso Manasikara not lead to some/all of these arising?

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/190sai4/where_is_the_suffering/kgwn9lv/)** _2024-01-08 15:36:16_:

    1. Anger is a result of the underlying, unrecognized attitude of resistance against the unpleasantness of hearing something upsetting. Unpleasantness is in hearing something upsetting. Suffering is that very resistance against the unpleasantness (craving).

    Thus, resistance is what is on you; unpleasantness arises on its own when the senses experience certain things (*what* things specifically is irrelevant and will depend on the individual).

    &#x200B;

    2. An angry mental state is an indirect consequence of that which is on you (the resistance), so it should not be gotten rid of directly.  Instead, you need to discern how it is that you are resisting the displeasure, and how to "endure it on the right level" instead (this is yoniso manasikāra). Then the anger will be indirectly deprived of its fuel and eventually fade, while the unpleasantness remains.

### Giving into pressure

I am here to seek help. I have been listening to HH for past 4 years. And for the past year, I have been constantly giving into pressures. I give into pressure even when I am fully aware that I’m making a bad choices and hate my self when giving into them. This has made me realize that every-time pressure arise, which it will everyday, I will give into them. Due to this, I am self-loathing and thinking about ending myself. What could I do?

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/18ymn08/giving_into_pressure/kgg5ys6/)** _2024-01-05 16:13:22_:

    It's important to be clear that true abandonment of unwholesome habits and not acting out of pressures *has* to be unpleasant because it essentially comes down to freeing oneself from the most deeply rooted addiction of all. An addict who does not experience withdrawal symptoms is necessarily still taking the same drug in one form or another.

    So instead of hoping to find a way for the undertaking of wholesome behavior not to be painful initially (which tends to be the reason behind the sense of "I can't do this"), it's about taking it on the pain to the degree that one can without being overwhelmed. If you still cannot keep the five precepts, you can work towards that goal one by one.

    Also, one has to recognize the previous careless choices that make one end up being overwhelmed with pressure in the first place. A person can never accidentally find themselves with a mind so full of lust that (it feels like) they cannot help but give in; it's always because, when the mind was not *as* lustful, they chose to go down a path where lust would increase. Restraining those easily ignored choices from the start would've been far less painful than restraining later once the mind has already gone far off the rails, which is when people usually care to remember the practice.

### Is there a comprehensive guide or system of the gradual training for lay people?

I’m happy to have recently come across hillside hermitage and the teachings presented here. The content is quite dense to say the least so I’m wondering if there is a system or guide for those at day one? 
All the best .

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/18x5imq/is_there_a_comprehensive_guide_or_system_of_the/kg4efjk/)** _2024-01-03 13:15:38_:

    A useful point to bear in mind is that there is no hope to correctly begin with any of the subsequent "stages" of the Gradual Training if the precepts have not been covered. So for example, a person would be better served addressing whatever is preventing them from becoming celibate than trying to practice sense restraint and abandonment of hindrances within non-celibacy. One cannot even correctly grasp what sense restraint is if the mind isn't already settled in celibacy, because that "restraint" will all be about superficially denying something that one deep down still plans to give in to at some point—meaning, one is already "grasping the signs and features" of sensual objects by default, even when one actively tries to do the opposite.

    Another thing worth mentioning that may not be apparent from the usual formulation of the Gradual Training is that even the first step of virtue is not just about keeping the letter of the precepts. The Buddha says it's about "seeing the danger in the slightest fault", meaning that even things that are not covered by the precepts one should be vigilant about. For instance, frivolous speech and carelessness in interactions with others is not prohibited by the precepts, but it certainly is a "fault" that comes within the training, a central one at that, given that there can be no restraint of mind without restraint of speech beforehand. In a lay setting that is even more important, as one is forced to interact with people that do not share one's values of renunciation, and for whom speech is a central outlet for delight in pleasure and distraction.

    Aside from that, the Gradual Training shouldn't really be thought of as a "systematic process", but as one thing that can be practiced on subsequent degrees of subtlety: not acting out unwholesomely by body, speech, and mind. A person who understands that "simple" instruction in its full scope fulfills all the "elements" of the Gradual Training all at once without explicitly thinking about them. In fact, even the first "step" of "seeing the danger in the slightest fault", when refined to the utmost, already covers the entire practice all the way to samādhi. Abandoning mental "faults" (hindrances), which are just like bodily and verbal faults but on a subtler level, is the cultivation of samādhi; absorbing oneself on objects is unrelated to the Gradual Training and not right samādhi, because it has nothing to do with virtue except in some fabricated and tenuous ways (which is why people that haven't even started the Gradual Training can get that "samādhi" too).

    So overall, one can try to emphasize individual aspects of the overall picture of restraint and wholesome conduct that seem to require more work than others in one's particular case, but ultimately one should be looking to extract the general principle of noticing when one's mind is leaning towards things with craving, and then restraining accordingly.

    That principle then underlies one's entire life 24/7, and the specifics will be automatically covered.

### The mechanism of doubt

 This morning I've tried to dig out certain HH video concerning the workings of doubt, the one, if I remember correctly, in which the resolution of doubts is said to be found in starving them out by not feeding (into) them. Basically, an interrogation of doubts was recognized as the food for their growth and sustenance.

Maybe I'm confabulating because the only HH's video on the topic I'm able to find now is the one with a nearly opposite account on it (the one titled "The Pain of Doubt") - Ajahn Nyanamoli advices there a thorough examination as a way for resolving any doubts.

In a sense I'm not only interested in recalling the name of the exact video in question (although I would be glad if someone could point me to it), but I would also like to hear some of the possible takes on these two seemingly different approaches dealing with doubt, especially since both seem very sound to me.

Should doubts be faced by interrogating them until nothing of them remains, or they should be seen as Mara's baits with which any contact necessarily leads to just further entanglements and more doubts?

    >  
    >Maybe I'm confabulating because the only HH's video on the topic I'm able to find now is the one with a nearly opposite account on it (the one titled "The Pain of Doubt") -

    The topic of how taking doubts at face value and trying to resolve them can be unwholesome has been addressed so many times, including in talks whose main topic was something else, that it'd be hard to pinpoint a specific one based only on this description.

    >Ajahn Nyanamoli advices there a thorough examination as a way for resolving any doubts.

    In fact, what was said in this video actually means the same thing: the examination is not about what *the doubt is about* but about one's present situation of a mind that craves for answers. That is the "level" where any examination that develops the mind has to apply; anything else will be just furthering one's knowledge and learning *about* the Dhamma (which can be useful, but should never be confused with the mental cultivation of not acting out of hindrances that eventually allows one to see the Dhamma).

    Most of the time and for most people, the answers they already have are good enough if they have been not only learning about the Dhamma for a while but especially been clearing up the wrong views embedded in most of contemporary Buddhism. So there comes a point where one should start emphasizing putting what one already knows (that acting out of pressure of any kind is unwholesome and a hindrance to understanding) into practice rather than finding ever-better answers, as that is an endless task.

    Fundamentally, the pressure to find a new answer, like any other pressure such as sensuality, is rooted in a *mental state* that is present and is unpleasant, so by descending into the content of one's thoughts, whether it's theoretical information about the Dhamma, thoughts of sensuality or ill will, one is automatically falling into the trap of craving against displeasure on that internal, more "ambiguous" level, whereas externally in the case of thinking about the Dhamma, it all might seem fully justified and wholesome to one's superficial examination.

    A good test to see if it's better just to endure the discomfort of doubt rather than give in to it and look for the answer is to check how one would feel if no answer were to be found in the end. If the mere thought of it makes you feel anxious, most likely there is an underlying craving there that you better not act out of, because if you do, *there will be no satisfactory answer in the end for that very reason.* As in, even if you were to go to the Buddha himself and receive the best possible answer, it would still leave you unsatisfied because there is a *mental* *state* of dissatisfaction, plain and simple, underlying your entire experience.

    As a matter of fact, acting out of such seemingly "justified" pressures, as would become apparent over time, actually leaves you vulnerable to all the *other* pressures that were seemingly unrelated. For example, every sensual object you encounter will be that much more pressing and evocative of lust once you have given up on the quest for the answer, because you were *cultivating craving*, regardless of *what* it was directed toward. So then the same craving will now just rest upon the next thing that takes center stage, whether it be in the form of sensuality, aversion, laziness, or restlessness. (That's why the hindrances are fundamentally five expressions of the same thing, they cannot be abandoned or managed one-by-one by repressing thoughts).

    &#x200B;

    >Should doubts be faced by interrogating them until nothing of them remains, or they should be seen as Mara's baits with which any contact necessarily leads to just further entanglements and more doubts?

    So, both, because the "interrogation" is on the level of the intention behind, your present situation, what is being ignored, etc. (and that's where all the information about what craving is, why it's the root of suffering, etc., would eventually be recognized as a truth rather than as an idea). Failing to interrogate oneself  correctly on *that* level automatically leads to biting Māra's baits, because lack of clarity about one's mind state and overall situation here and now is all it takes to fall prey to those. One doesn't have to *knowingly* bite the baits to get hooked; it's more like the default state of ignorance means already biting them.

    "Nothing of the doubts" will remain when you cease to resist the discomfort that pushes you to look for answers (without getting rid of it either). That is the only real "end" to doubt, as uncertainty and its concomitant discomfort is a natural element of all experience and it cannot, nor needs to be removed.

    It should also be noted that not acting out of the pressure of doubt doesn't mean ceasing to receive the utterance-of-another (Suttas, Dhamma talks, etc.). It means that one shouldn't do it in cases when that "itch" that will just worsen upon scratching is the primary motivating factor, until the itch ceases. If the action is not a "scratch" to the itch and one knows it makes no difference to it, then it's fine (and that applies to all other hindrances too).

    Repeated instruction helps prevent one from inadvertently twisting what one has heard to fit with one's wrong views.

### Physicality of Breath

Hello all, just have a question pertaining to the discernment of breathing as ajahn has described.  

It seems like intrinsically it is all about discerning that the breath is the basis for the continued life of the body, always.  Physicality of breath is just a sensation within that.  However, he also mentions that sometimes you want to "do" and breathing is the most wholesome type of doing.

Does this mean that essentially while enduring pressure, you can find the sensation of breath and essentially take refuge in it while the senses are under attack?

Thanks everyone :)

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/18sbwjy/physicality_of_breath/kf9cmiw/)** _2023-12-28 12:38:56_:

    >Physicality of breath is just a sensation within that.

    No, quite the opposite. The "physicality" of the *breathing body*, not of *the breath*, is what should be discerned; sensations are irrelevant and secondary to the physicality. Even if you experienced no sensations on account of it, you would still know beyond doubt that you're breathing. That's just how it works because it's an *intention*, not a process that happens by itself and that you "observe" from an independent point of view.

    &#x200B;

    >However, he also mentions that sometimes you want to "do" and breathing is the most wholesome type of doing.

    Yes, but that was in a particular context. Only with the Right View does one know what is wholesome and unwholesome, to begin with. So "doing" the breathing will only be wholesome if the Right View is there as the criterion.

    &#x200B;

    >Does this mean that essentially while enduring pressure, you can find the sensation of breath and essentially take refuge in it while the senses are under attack?

    So no, because as soon as you talk about "sensations", what you are referring to is shifting your attention to something else as to become unaware of the pressure.

    Rather, the physicality of breathing can be known while pressure is being endured, because that is happening on a different level than the pressure. Sensations are even more particular than the pressure, let alone the physicality, so if you direct your attention to that, you are actually diminishing your context even more than if you had just stayed with the pressure as it was and done nothing.

### Emptiness in the suttas?

I was reading the suttanipata yesterday and found a sutta with this:

>The monk who hasn't slipped past or turned back, knowing with regard to the world that "**All this is unreal**," sloughs off the near shore & far — as a snake, its decrepit old skin.  
>  
>[Thanissaro, Snp 1.1](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/snp/snp.1.01.than.html)

It seems the predominant translation choice is 'unreal' for the highlighted phrase besides B. Sujato who renders it as such:

>They have not run too far nor run back,  
Yo nāccasārī na paccasārī,  
for they know that **nothing in the world is what it seems**.  
*Sabbaṁ vitathamidanti ñatva loke*;  
Such a mendicant sheds the near shore and the far,  
So bhikkhu jahāti orapāraṁ,  
as a serpent its old worn-out skin.  
Urago jiṇṇamivattacaṁ purāṇaṁ.

Which translation is accurate? If it *is* indeed 'unreal', how should it be understood? I find 'realness' and 'unrealness' very vaguely defined in nearly any conversation surrounding it. When I myself refer to real, I don't know what quality/property that refers to within my experience; is it the presence of phenomena within experience? No clue. But if that is the case, well certainly you can't deny the fact of things being present? So that lends me to thinking that this can't be the meaning.

Would appreciate any insight.

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/18r00g7/emptiness_in_the_suttas/keyk5si/)** _2023-12-26 06:43:47_:

    There is no concept of "real vs. unreal" in the Suttas.  *vitatha* is more like "false" or "untrue".

    But even if one chooses to translate it as "unreal", it would not automatically wrong. The problem is what people actually *mean* with that, and usually, it's the idea that there is some "True Reality" underlying our experience that is "hidden", but nevertheless we somehow know it exists (a contradiction in terms). Even worse, that reality is then inadvertently conceived to be accessible through special *perceptions* and *experiences* that one can gain through meditation, making it very much within the same ordinary reality of perception and the aggregates in its *nature,* just that the *content* of it is "special" and "extraordinary", as if that were of any relevance.

    &#x200B;

    >“Therefore, bhikkhus, any kind of form whatsoever, whether past, future, or present, internal or external, ***gross or subtle, lowly or sublime,*** far or near, all form should be seen as it really is with correct wisdom thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’

    “Any kind of feeling whatsoever … Any kind of perception whatsoever … Any kind of volitional formations whatsoever … Any kind of consciousness whatsoever, whether past, future, or present, internal or external, ***gross or subtle, lowly or sublime***, far or near, all consciousness should be seen as it really is with correct wisdom thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’

    —SN 22.59

    Some Suttas talk about the aggregates being "empty" and "devoid of essence", such as SN 22.95. But the difference is that the Buddha is not implicitly positing something "more real" and "not empty" that lies beneath the aggregates (as if something "outside" the aggregates can even be designated or experienced, when the aggregates *are* experience full stop), and contrasting a "conventional reality" with a mystical "ultimate reality".

    He's just saying that *everything* is devoid of essence, including any notions that you might have of something that *isn't* devoid of essence, which would have to be nothing but another perception. That's it.

    So if you want, you could say that "everything is unreal" for as long as you don't peripherally designate something that *is* real, which leads to eternalism in disguise, even in the name of Nibbāna (which as far as I've seen seems to be present in Thanissaro's view). When your mind posits something as "real", you would have to include that within "unreal", even if seems like it's Nibbāna itself. That's the true all-encompassing dispassion and freedom from conceivings.

### Why is anicca explained in these two forms: impermanent and un-ownable

why is anicca explained as impermanent in some places and un-ownable elsewhere.. the un-ownable aspect is more vivid, that these are totally not under my control..
I can relate to the impermance aspect as: I have no say in their disappearance.. how else to understand impermance

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/18qgjkg/why_is_anicca_explained_in_these_two_forms/keyi0kn/)** _2023-12-26 06:18:27_:

    *anicca* does literally mean "impermanent", but the problem is that nowadays that term tends evoke in people the notion that it's about *observing* change like a scientist would, like how it's commonly taught that one realizes *anicca* by *observing t*he constant arising and passing of phenomena, "zooming" into the experiences even closer until one can see even more changes per second, etc.

    And all of that fails to show why the Buddha said all that is anicca is dukkha, and that *because* they are dukkha, they are anattā. It instead jumps right into saying that because everything is always changing, there can be no "lasting entity", and that's what anattā is (meaning, it's about "no-self" instead of "not-self", so it's the extreme of annihilationism in disguise).

    Also, if things in our experience are constantly changing and never remain the same from one moment to the next, there is no reason why that has to be dukkha. One could very well find a kind of happiness in there being perpetual novelty and that one never has to "cross the same river twice", as they say.

    So the term "unownable" is to point towards the type of impermanence that matters, meaning the impermanence that is always necessarily dukkha, and thus prevents you from taking *anything* that you see in that way as "mine".

    Things are anicca not because you are *witnessing* or *have witnessed* their change, but because you *know* that you can't prevent them from changing (i.e., you can't own them), even if they last an uncountable amount of eons. On the contrary, the thing needs to still be present for you to know that it's *liable to change* (and that's what anicca is, hence it's always synonymous with *vipariṇāmadhamma* in the Suttas). When a thing truly "disappears", you can't know anything about its nature anymore.

    So that's how one can undermine one's sense of self (by applying this discernment on the emotional level of one's attachments, including one's very body and aggregates), whereas with the "observable change" wrong view of anicca, the sense of self always remains the "witnesser" at the background who is still seen as permanent and pleasurable.

### 37 factors of awakening

How one puts into practice, the 37 factors of enlightenment listed in DN 16,Mahaparinibbana sutta,

consisting of The Four Ways of Attending to Mindfulness,
the Four Right Strivings,
the Four Paths to Power,
the Five Faculties,
the Five Strengths,
the Seven Factors of Awakening,
the Noble Eight-Fold Path.

Are all these factors developed one after another? 

Or can one only check all these factors in an action? 

Thank you for your explanation and understanding

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/18pmj2t/37_factors_of_awakening/kepm5nv/)** _2023-12-24 06:14:02_:

    The 7 enlightenment factors are *acquired* with stream-entry, as stated in SN 46.30. Also, in MN 2, they are at the very last section of the Sutta, which presupposes completion of the 1st part (abandoning the first three fetters), given that it says "reflecting *yoniso,* he develops these 7 factors". As stated in the beginning of the Sutta, it is because of not understanding *yoniso manasikāra* that one is a puthujjana.

    The pleasant feelings that may arise on account of practicing what one *thinks* are the 7 enlightenment factors are not a criterion for whether that idea is right or not. Even for the first factor, sati\*/\*recollection, one needs to have the Right View to know what is it that needs to be recollected and in what way. [Wrong view leads to wrong recollection.](https://suttacentral.net/sn45.1/en/bodhi?lang=en)

    Similarly, the [five faculties only exis](https://suttacentral.net/sn48.12/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=sidebyside&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin)t in someone who is [no longer a puthujjana.](https://suttacentral.net/sn25.1/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=sidebyside&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin)

    Even in the case of the four right strivings, it's about making effort to abandon unwholesome and cultivate wholesome. And that distinction is only known, again, [by a noble disciple.](https://suttacentral.net/mn9/en/bodhi?lang=en&reference=none&highlight=false)

    So one's goal should be to abandon wrong view and get the Right View, after which developing these 37 factors—or only one group because all of them are simply different formulations of the same thing—will be possible.

### Understanding Peripheral Awareness Pt 2

Last week I made a post on here about peripheral awareness, and contemplating the responses to that led me to at least upgrade my understanding.  I thought I'd post an updated version of my last post / some notes from my practice.  Hopefully it is helpful to others, would really appreciate critiques and comments just like last time too.  I really want to know if something I say is wrong, so I know where to look.  Let me know if this doesn't fit with what is wanted in this community, I really value when people share their own experiences and find it very helpful, but I don't want to be annoying.  A lot of people don't like talking about their practice but I feel like it's really helpful to put words to some of the subtle challenges / experiences that many of us probably share.  

The main problem before was that I was making peripheral awareness way too complicated without really understanding it fundamentally.  It's not really that complex, it's just a different direction than the mind generally goes.  I had a moment where I just realized that it's about having phenomena occur while you know their nature -- so it's knowing where things came from while they happen.  I think Ajahn said that verbatim in a video.  Anyhow, I realized that I had just been rehashing things I already "knew" over and over again actively, hoping for the experience to conform to whatever image of the right experience I had.  If the knowledge of the basis was not around in the form of observable thoughts, then I assumed something was wrong.  Because while still knowing about anatta, that everything was clearly arising on the basis of the body, etc, I still wanted my practice to be within the realm of my immediate control -- despite the fact that "me" is composed of things that are out of my control anyways.  And the realm of perceived control on the basis of self is the foreground.

But the reality is that you can't know something twice over - you know it or you don't.  Once you know it, the knowledge is there.  So the awareness that we are aiming for is actually awareness of the knowledge itself, not holding the knowledge as an object or something you can see.  Then it's just the foreground, the prior foreground is now the background. 

So instead I started observing what was actually occurring in the now, where I was appropriating that experience as self, and then realizing that it was already in the basis of the body, and by extension I must be breathing because the body is there.  And after a while it became clear that I already KNEW that, but I kept feeling like I had to apply the knowledge, even at a very subtle level, to individual experiences or they would be appropriated as self.

But then I recalled that he mentioned applying the knowledge of the basis to your experience as a whole.  So that is the path away from looking at individual phenomena.  It's like I was saying "okay, this is definitely here on account of the body, but what about that other thing here on account of the body, how did that get here?"  If all possible experiences fall under the same basis, no mental exertion needs to be applied to understanding each component.  They all have the same origin, same significance, and same ultimate fate.   

So while practicing on the level of the whole experience, I found also that the knowledge itself is very much persisting on its own, even when it is out of sight.  It really is, and it makes sense, because my image of self is obviously inaccurate -- things really don't need to be grasped in the foreground to exist.  They don't need to be maintained by the self, because one can only grasp things that are already there anyways.

That has led me to now.  Essentially, I sit and allow phenomena to occur as they will.  Those objects arise already within the basis of the body.  I already know that I know this, and I already know that I already know that I know this.  As they occur, I'm aware that I already know, and the phenomena just serve to validate that further.  It's like everything is falling into a box, and when it goes outside of the box, it's obvious because I start appropriating it.  So while appropriating at some point I see what is happening and know that I know where it came from, and then let it endure - the pressure is already off at that point.  

What I don't quite understand is HOW I know that I know without bringing anything to mind.  I'm fully within the experience, yet at some level I also know that I know where it came from.  As things arise, their origin is already known as not-self, so there isn't much room for resistance.  I love when the mind is racing now, just having that small sliver of knowing that you ALREADY KNOW where it came from is enough to stop fighting or analyzing -- over-analyzing has crippled me for years in meditation.  And that knowledge I just mentioned doesn't require any thinking at all.  It's more like a recognition of what is already there.  Once you let phenomena fall into that box, there is no reason to fight anything, the fight isn't even yours.  

So from where I'm standing now it seems like I just need to maintain this and endure whatever arises.  I've been trying to stay absolutely still as well, I'm not sure if that is important but it does seem to be a lot more turbulent so I've been sticking to that.  I see why sense restraint is so important now, because you definitely can't take this to fulfillment if you're still mindlessly appropriating things without seeing their actual basis.  It's really hard to see it in the first place.  I also see why the videos all seemed unclear at some level to me, it's because you have to not fully commit to the foreground, but how do you communicate that to someone who only knows the foreground?  It's not even an escape from the foreground, it's just an understanding of where it came from.  But legitimately conceiving how you would do that IN THE MOMENT is very difficult when your frame of reference is only foreground and self.  Another thing I realized is that you don't need to rehash what you already know once you know it.  I haven't said "im breathing, body is here" etc at all, I don't even try to look at that beyond implicitly and thoughtlessly understanding it as things arise on that basis.  But maybe I'm getting carried away because it's novel to me that I CAN do it like that at all.

I would really appreciate critiques to what I have described here, ANY opinions, etc.  Especially if I'm just flat out wrong like I was last time.  Really, any comment welcome, thanks so much to everyone who read this and HUGE thanks to everyone who responded to my last post, that had a direct impact on my practice.

    What seems to have happened is that you "loosened the strings" that were previously too tight, to use the oft-mentioned simile. You recognized to a slightly greater extent that your idea of sati was mixed with a craving to overly investigate things and "figure them out".

    The way that progress happens is basically that one repeatedly recognizes that one's practice had been either too tight or too loose, meaning one was either questioning, investigating, and attending to things too closely on the one end, or being *too* "open to whatever arises" on the other end (to put it coarsely). And each time that realization comes about, it feels like *everything* one was doing was completely wrong. This is why it's important to always be willing to start from scratch, and always assume one's practice to be necessarily off in *some* way that one is not yet aware of.

    Only then, after going through that "restart" process thousands of times, one will eventually have found the *actual* Middle Way, and will be unable to drift away from it unknowingly like before. That's when one sees the Fourth Noble Truth, meaning one knows what the Noble Eightfold Path actually is. Before that, one's eight factors are either "overshooting" or "undershooting" the mark, hence they cannot be called "noble" (and obviously that excludes the possibility of having actual jhānas, since for that one needs to be well versed in "tuning the strings" even as a puthujjana, which is why it would very quickly lead one to more than sotāpatti).

    What I see from what you've written is that you are probably not investigating and questioning your motivations and background attitudes *enough* now. So what you need to do is find a way to tighten the strings again without going all the way to where you were before, and then rinse and repeat for as many times as it takes, not being afraid of the thought that you might have to do it a million times more or even scrap the whole thing, even after decades of practice—taking all insights and seeming progress along the way with a pinch of salt because that's never what matters. What matters is whether you are *incapable* of ever doing something other than the right practice.

    The only reliable confirmation of that is what is described in SN 36.6, and that needs to be that way even when you don't try to practice.

### The suffering left for a stream-enterer (SN 56.49)

*“Mendicants, suppose a person was to place down on Sineru, the king of mountains, seven pebbles the size of mung beans.*

*What do you think, mendicants?*

*Which is more: the seven pebbles the size of mung beans? Or Sineru, the king of mountains?”*

*(...)*

*“In the same way, for a person with comprehension, a noble disciple accomplished in view, the suffering that’s over and done with is more, what’s left is tiny.*

*Compared to the mass of suffering in the past that’s over and done with, it doesn’t count, there’s no comparison, it’s not worth a fraction, since there are at most seven more lives."*

SN 56.49   


I was curious about the usage of this sutta by Ajahn Nyanamoli, along with the assertions that a sotapanna is unable to suffer amidst suffering.

The Buddha himself explains, that in this simile, for sotapannas the mountain is all the suffering of the past lives, and the pebbles are the possible seven (at most) future lives as a human. It makes sense, given that there is no discernible beginning of samsara and that the hells are a lot worse than the human realm. 

But Ajahn Nyanamoli sometimes presents it as if just during this present lifetime, a putthujana has a mountain of suffering, and a sotapanna has only 7 pebbles compared to that. Kinda ignoring all the craving that is left and how some bad circumstances can stir it up.

So, if we ignore samsara, does the simile still hold? I'll gladly hear your takes on this, especially Bhante's. 

If anyone more familiar with Ven. Nanavira's writings could share how he described the experience leading to his demise (i.e. was it suffering or rather a calculated decision without suffering?) that would be much appreciated too.

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/18mfhxc/the_suffering_left_for_a_streamenterer_sn_5649/ke5iefv/)** _2023-12-20 07:28:54_:

    >But Ajahn Nyanamoli sometimes presents it as if just during this present lifetime, a putthujana has a mountain of suffering, and a sotapanna has only 7 pebbles compared to that. Kinda ignoring all the craving that is left and how some bad circumstances can stir it up.

    The first thing to remember is that the Buddha did not give that simile within the context of rebirth specifically, or at least that could not have been his main intention, given that a sotāpanna doesn't even know for themselves that they will be reborn even once. That always remains to some extent a belief on the basis of faith and some amount of reasoning, and they accept it because they experience for themselves the sheer depth of the Buddha's teaching and the Four Noble Truths, and have no reason to doubt whatever the person who arrived at that ultimate insight by himself says, especially when it perfectly fits with everything that they do see here and now with their own understanding.

    So when the Buddha was referring to the 7 grains of sand left, the main context of that is the suffering that is destroyed in the present life through seeing the Dhamma.

    The answer as to how that is is given in SN 36.6. The "second arrow" is that mountain of suffering that is not present even in the sotāpanna (and note that the Sutta says "ariyasāvaka", not "Arahant", meaning it includes not only the sotāpanna but also the Dhamma- and saddhānusāri, the ones whose sotāpatti is guaranteed and are already ariyas).

    The "mountain of suffering" is there because of the fact that the puthujjana does not see the way out of suffering, no matter how fortunate their circumstances might be in this present life and that they may not experience any *actual* suffering. The fact that they are not certain that they can be unaffected by *any* displeasure that comes up means they are already affected here and now. The simile Ajahn Nyanamoli gave in the first chapter of Dhamma Within Reach was of a person who lives within a lion's enclosure. They may not have even seen any actual lions around, but the simple fact of *being there* and not knowing how to get out is tremendous suffering compared to one who is able to *at least* get out without fail whenever a lion comes, if not prevent themselves from being there in the first place.

    So yes, a sotāpanna does have craving left from the point of view of an Arahant, but the reason why they are still free from suffering compared to the puthujjana is that they are fully able to escape *even* the suffering that results from their own acting out of craving, sensuality and aversion. In other words, even if they *actively* commit actions that lead to suffering, it is impossible for them to experience suffering the way the puthujjana does. This is why so many householders in the Suttas went back to their ordinary lives after they saw the Dhamma, since they knew beyond doubt that no matter what they did, they wouldn't suffer compared to before. That can give rise to a great sense of complacency, which is why the Buddha had to encourage even ariyasāvakas to be diligent, etc.

    The principle explained in AN 3.100 about the lump of salt is explicitly about experiencing the results of kamma, but it works exactly the same way on the level of craving and suffering. The sotāpanna's mind does not experience, or only to a trifle amount, the suffering resulting from what would externally be the same amount of craving as an ordinary person.

### Lack of samvega

I have been lying to myself that I am "practicing" for more than a year. I kind of determined that this teaching is something that is something that is least likely to be wrong in whatever things I have read into. The only part left was applying the medicine.

But all this time, I couldn't even establish precepts and sense restraint properly. And this isn't just a slip back here and there but the same sensuality that I delighted in early back, I keep delighting in it even now. In the retrospect, I have gained a lot of theoretical knowledge and wrapped my head somehow around it but honestly I am in the literal same place as I was. The mind is still just as easily disturbed.

When I tried looking into what is wrong with me, I couldn't even discern my reasons behind why did I take up the dhamma practice. I can't even discern that I have an illness. It's not like I am not bothered by things - recently, something permanently affected one of my tooth and I was deeply affected and anxious due to it. Initially I was able to put this into the context that this is really the nature of suffering and that I really need to put efforts. It worked for sometime but then that thing got psychologized and it no more feels threatening. It doesn't help that certain good worldly things have been happening in my life that blind me even more. I feel hopeless that I will ever be able to take upon the practice as if my life depends even though I intellectually believe it very much does.

In short, I have been fooling myself and don't have the samvega necessary for the practice. Is there anything I can do so that I constantly "feel" the weight of existence?

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/18mb67z/lack_of_samvega/ke5jwi5/)** _2023-12-20 07:47:39_:

    Firstly, you want to make sure that your reasons for taking up the practice are clear, because that's the only thing that will keep you going when inspiration fades (which will have to happen because that's just another arisen experience). Try to recognize what the Buddha meant with "being prey to suffering", which is the realization that left people back in the day no choice *but* to take up the practice. It's not the fact that you *are* suffering right now, nor that there are any specific events that you know will cause you suffering in the future. It's the fact that *if* something intensely unpleasant where to happen, you know that you will suffer on account of it, and that possibility looms greater the more pleasures and acquisitions the mind depends on (the higher you go, the harder you will eventually fall, when death comes at the very latest).

    Having said that, it's not about constantly *trying* to feel the weight of existence, because if that weight is being felt "on your own terms", meaning you are the one bringing it about, it will not be felt on the right level. It will be weighing on where you can carry it, so to speak, because you're fabricating it volitionally. 

    You would "feel the weight" on the right level by recognizing how you *can't* get yourself to feel it all the time, and how the urge to practice comes and goes on its own. That will make you see how you can't even rely on your own moods to aid your practice, and that even that which is closest to you—your own mind—is actually doing it's own thing, not really for your best interest most of the time.

    The "weight" needs to be felt on the level of the uncertainty of not being able to get what you want, no matter what that is, including the desire to "feel the weight".

### Difference between ordinary people and noble disciple

Hello, [here in this talk](https://youtu.be/gkwYOroXqK0?si=NAv2_WE-VzQ86N8s&t=300) Venerable Nyanamoli addresses the subject of the two arrows simile explaining the difference between puthujjana and ariya, the later not suffering on the level of the mind when suffering on the level of the body, while puthujjana does.

&#x200B;

When reading this sutta I always thought "bodily suffering" referred to an unpleasant feeling at the level of touch (hurting), sight (too bright), earing (too loud), taste (too disgusting), smell (too stinky), but I didn't consider it could also be at the level of the mind.

And I would like your help to clarify if I correctly understood what Ajahn Nyanamoli said and to better understand what's happening in the following example he gave:

&#x200B;

One is seeing someone (or it could be something) they don't like and they feel anger or anxiety on account of seeing them/it. **The ariya knowing the sight pertains to something unownable is not struck by that second arrow.**

Here do I understand correctly that the first arrow would be only seeing someone/something **I don't like**, while the second arrow would be feeling anger or anxiety on account of it?

&#x200B;

(1) So here the first arrow would be only the sight which pertains to the eyes, while the second arrow would be the feeling on the level of the mind that arise as a reaction to that sight.

What I don't understand then is: why should the sight be felt as an arrow in the first place, isn't it only unpleasant because it is a sight of something **I don't like,** unpleasant because of the feeling on the level of the mind arising because of the reaction to that sight? If there was only the sight without the reaction ("I don't like") there would be no place for unpleasant feeling (meaning no first arrow)?

&#x200B;

(2) Which lead me to question my understanding: could the first arrow rather be feeling anger or anxiety on account of seeing someone/something I don't like, while the second arrow would be resisting that unpleasant feeling (anger or anxiety) and suffering because there is now an unpleasant feeling and I don't want it and don't know what to do about it for it to subside?

Or could there be 3 arrows in this case (the sight, the reaction to the sight, the reaction to the reaction of the sight)?

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/18lxugh/difference_between_ordinary_people_and_noble/ke5fr3c/)** _2023-12-20 06:57:02_:

    &#x200B;

    >(1) So here the first arrow would be only the sight which pertains to the eyes, while the second arrow would be the feeling on the level of the mind that arise as a reaction to that sight.

    What I don't understand then is: why should the sight be felt as an arrow in the first place, isn't it only unpleasant because it is a sight of something I don't like, unpleasant because of the feeling on the level of the mind arising because of the reaction to that sight? If there was only the sight without the reaction ("I don't like") there would be no place for unpleasant feeling (meaning no first arrow)?

    Yes, there is a contradiction there, which is how you know that can't be right. The fact that the Buddha is calling it an "arrow" means it *is* unpleasant, so one must keep that as one's starting point. Often people's idea of Arahantship is inadvertently that there is *no* arrow, precisely because the ignorant mind sees no way to not suffer on account of a feeling other than *not having it at all.* When one gets to see how there can be the full extent of feeling without suffering, one understands the Four Noble Truths. Before that point, one's idea of the ending of suffering necessitates, whether one realizes it or not, the ending of *unpleasant feelings*.

    And that is what the "first arrow" is. Take *any* experience of feeling, [whether past, future, or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near](https://suttacentral.net/sn22.59/en/bodhi?lang=en&reference=none&highlight=false) and see that as that which is given on its own. The "second arrow" is, in simple terms, due to the ownership of feelings, meaning that the mind feels a sense of entitlement to any degree towards what is felt. If it's pleasant, it feels entitled to get more and suffers if it can't, and if it's unpleasant, it feels entitled to get less and suffers if it can't. If it's neutral, it feels entitled to distract itself with something more engaging and suffers if it can't.

    And this is where the Gradual Training comes in. Only by *actually* going through that development of one's behavior can one eventually get to see the sheer "size" of what feeling is. Otherwise, one will be confusing the extent of the "entitlement" with the extent of the feeling, and one's only conception of an escape from the situation will be to get rid of the feeling, and that's what most contemporary Buddhist practices revolve around.

    &#x200B;

    >(2) Which lead me to question my understanding: could the first arrow rather be feeling anger or anxiety on account of seeing someone/something I don't like, while the second arrow would be resisting that unpleasant feeling (anger or anxiety) and suffering because there is now an unpleasant feeling and I don't want it and don't know what to do about it for it to subside?

    It depends on the situation and in what direction one's ignorance is going at the moment. There will be times when one will be confusing what is just the first arrow of an unpleasant feeling (which naturally comes with associated perceptions and intentions) with anger or anxiety when it's not (e.g. perceiving someone as a useless fool is not *necessarily* anger, as exemplified by the Buddha all over the Suttas) . Other times, one will be missing the mark by thinking that everything is the first arrow and not recognizing one's unwholesome attitudes that factually have to be abandoned. So that's why it's essential to keep questioning one's understanding and not think that it's correct, because both of these wrong views can give rise to "pleasant results"  that people  would mistake to be a sign of progress.

    So the only way to start getting it right reliably is to learn how to see the full *extent* of one's feelings (which is where the "endurance" we talk about comes in, and it's also what the oft-mentioned sign of the mind is). Only then can one get to see for oneself where the feeling "ends" and where one's gratuitous entitlement "begins".

### If I can't have angry thoughts without an angry mind, am I all the time angry ?

Well if something makes me suddenly angry, let's say my son broke something I care about, anger swells up. But as Ajahn says, the anger was already there ! Does it mean that anger, lust and so forth are all the time already there and they just rise up in the mind depending on external triggers ?

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/18kd1ok/if_i_cant_have_angry_thoughts_without_an_angry/kdqo3zq/)** _2023-12-17 11:06:35_:

    >Does it mean that anger, lust and so forth are all the time already there and they just rise up in the mind depending on external triggers ?

    What the statement "you can't have angry thoughts without an angry mind" is pointing towards is the discernment of simultaneous dependence in regard to the experience of anger.  Instead of trying to get rid of the thoughts at face value which is what people usually do, one should recognize the state of mind affected with anger, and learn to deal with that on the right level, meaning enduring it and not resisting the discomfort that comes from it. (See [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XMDbO8JLvo&ab_channel=HillsideHermitage)).

    Since that is the true root of the angry thoughts, their simultaneous "nutriment", it is impossible for them to continue to be there if the angry state of mind has been properly overcome in that way (through right endurance).

    But this will only make sense if one has recognized that the significances and perceptions of "this is unpleasant" or "this person is foolish" are not in themselves what constitutes an angry thought, as those will continue to arise even when there is no angry mind. The angry thoughts are on the level of your specific mental *actions* towards the significance of "this is unpleasant", of wishing another person harm or bitterly thinking over what you should have done to prevent this or that from happening. The angry mind is just the overall mood that inclines towards such actions and thoughts, so when an angry mind is left unchecked and allowed to grow, angry thoughts will come to the surface accordingly.

    One must learn to recognize one's state of mind so that one can see oneself proliferating it through little intentions and carelessness here and there when it's still not as strong, instead of recognizing what's going on only later once the coarse lustful and hateful thoughts are already coming up at full force and one is overwhelmed. That is usually the late stage at which people recognize their defilements, and address them wrongly with all sorts of secondary management methods to boot, never really getting to the root of the issue.

### Nāmarūpa-viññāna Viññāna-nāmarūpa

Hello, [in the latest video](https://youtu.be/lGJ7YTtsHhs&t=2074) Ajahn Nyanamoli talks about the knowledge of the simultaneity of two things and the dependence of those two things in the sotapanna's insight, and he finishes with : "Nāmarūpa-viññāna Viññāna-nāmarūpa dependence from paticcasamuppada still remains in an arahant".

&#x200B;

I think I also remember Venerable Anigha saying that Viññāna-nāmarūpa constitute one's all world, the entirety of one's experience, but I'm not sure how accurate is this memory.

&#x200B;

That's probably wrong but that's why I'm asking the questions:

Is Viññāna-nāmarūpa one's all world and is this exactly pointing at those simultaneous elements that Ajahn Nyanamoli advises puthujjanas to work on, namely what is (or is taken as) the sense of self and what is simultaneously there enduring on its own on which the sense of self depends?

So is nāmarūpa everything that is simultaneously enduring there, while viññāna is what is "attending to it while not attending to it"?

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/18jnd44/nāmarūpaviññāna_viññānanāmarūpa/kdpzz4j/)** _2023-12-17 05:58:58_:

    >So is nāmarūpa everything that is simultaneously enduring there, while viññāna is what is "attending to it while not attending to it"?

    &#x200B;

    More like, through learning to practice yoniso manasikāra, one gets to recognize the indirect nature of viññāṇa (which is not an "object" that you just "observe"; that's exactly the sort of attitude that needs to be abandoned). By having the simultaneous recognition of two phenomena, which together form the totality of your experience, there is no room for "something else" there, meaning the sense of "I am".

### Understanding Peripheral Awareness

I've been trying my best to comprehend how to practice peripheral awareness, and I would really appreciate any pointers from the community.  I'll outline how I understand it below.

&#x200B;

Essentially, the knowledge of the basis of your situation, as it endures, is totally outside of the sensory realm.  So you can't just attend that knowledge, if you think you are,  you are just attending the image of the knowledge while remaining within its basis.  So the knowledge that you are seated will endure really no matter what on its own level, because it is within its own unseeable realm.  However, its existence on its own is not consequential without awareness, with awareness it shapes all that is within the awareness.  Awareness on its own is also outside of the sensory realm, it's just a different type of knowledge - anything that represents the awareness is just a separate image on its own.  This is obviously deviating from what has been overtly said in the talks but it's just my anecdotally-derived idea of how it works as I understand it now and I want it to be torn apart.

&#x200B;

So the question is how do you actually maintain that awareness of the knowledge, and on what level, to what extent?  When I know that I'm breathing or sitting, and I try to maintain the image of the awareness of that, it is either represented by a sensual object (ie, a thought or a particular sensation / pressure you associate with that "thing") or it is quickly overtaken by the churning of other phenomena occurring on account of the body.

&#x200B;

I'm having a hard time discerning at what level something is actually being attended to or not - mental objects evolve and unravel right in front of me and it feels exactly the same whether I think I'm attending it or not.  Widening my area of attention so to speak is just an iteration of the same thing. This awareness of knowledge of basis seems like it needs to be attended or maintained on some level.  When I try to attend it, I'm just attending sensuality.  When I loosen up, it vanishes.  What is the middle point here?  From the talks and essay the awareness really seems to be beyond sensuality.

One idea I've been playing with is that perhaps it's continuously applying the awareness to what has arisen that maintains the awareness of knowledge.  So for instance a feeling of tightness is present in the head.  You understand even without really needing to think that this tightness has arisen on account of the body, within the sensory realm.  But it takes a second, you have to kind of step back, notice that you are perceiving it in an unskillful way (because it hurts!) and then view it within the context.  And then it really doesn't require anything more unless you go and overwrite that context in regard to that object that you attended for some period of time.

Sorry if this post doesn't make a ton of sense, it's kind of hard to bring experience into words in this way, I understand peripheral awareness from a high level but it's these nuances in practice that make it difficult to really understand on a moment-to-moment basis as it really is.  So it makes sense as an abstraction but I can tell that I don't really get it where it counts.

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/18hxzpy/understanding_peripheral_awareness/kdaj1u5/)** _2023-12-14 06:58:18_:

    What is sounds like is that you are inadvertently still turning peripheral awareness into a sense object by trying to tell yourself that it shouldn't be one. That's what the "peripheral" aspect refers to—it always has to do with what you are doing and the background implications of your attention to this or that here and now, so even if you are following the instructions verbatim, if peripherally you are not aware of how your mind is "looking with restlessness" towards this very practice you are doing, that's lacking peripheral awareness. What is peripheral is never "fixed"; it's the underlying basis of your situation here and now, often in the direction of "why am I doing/attending this?".

    In this case, instead of trying to *figure out* peripheral awareness and trying do "apply it" in an almost systematic way, you would be much closer to it by suspending the whole project on that "I am doing this" level, and catching that underlying pressure towards "figuring out" as a subtle phenomenon that is *real as such*. That's the key phrase always. It's not that the context is "outside" of the sensual realm in some esoteric sense, but that it entails a clarified recognition of things that are there and have always been there, but that one *overlooks* when one's attention is by default running along with the pull of sense objects. In this case, the thoughts about figuring out what peripheral awareness would *also* be sense objects. Only the knowledge of that pressure that results from not acting out of it can truly be said to not partake in that nature.

    That's why the only to *both* accurately wrap your head around and further cultivate peripheral awareness is virtue and sense restraint. When your mind is pressuring you towards some sense object, and mentally on the level of doubt, towards revisiting and redefining your Dhamma knowledge again and again, your intention to not act out of the pressure without trying to deny its presence constitutes peripheral awareness whether you're aware of it or not (and yes, it's another intention but on a different level, which is why it's not "out of this world" or something; the intention to give in to pressures is equally peripheral, in fact, so everyone is in a sense already practicing "peripheral awareness" always since that's the nature of the mind, just in the completely wrong direction and without recognizing it).

    That same principle you just expand towards everything else. Whether it's body postures, feelings, moods, or whatever, it needs to be used as a way to not be fully engaged with whatever movements are there in your experience here and now on the level of the six senses. That "not being fully engaged" in itself is what peripheral awareness is, not some (foreground) nuance of you directing your attention like this or like that, measuring how much is background and how much is foreground, etc., which is the direction one will tend to go initially due to the untamed habits of attention.

    That's why when the mind is tamed, peripheral awareness is always there even without making an effort. Not because you "strengthened it like a muscle", but because you by default don't get baited by whatever is happening in the six sense domain, so it's effortless. But yes, to get to that point, one must cultivate that attitude and keep trying to better understand it through concrete practices like the satipaṭṭhānas.

### What are the light and visions of forms talked about in MN 128 ?

Well my question is pretty straightforward. We have in MN 128 (upakkilesasutta) a long passage discussing light and visions during meditations, here is an example :

“Good, good, Anuruddha and friends! But as you live diligently like this, have you achieved any superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones, a meditation at ease?”

“Well, sir, while meditating diligent, keen, and resolute, we perceive both light and vision of forms. But before long the light and the vision of forms vanish. We haven’t worked out the reason for that.”

“Well, you should work out the reason for that. Before my awakening—when I was still unawakened but intent on awakening—I too perceived both light and vision of forms. But before long my light and vision of forms vanished. It occurred to me: ‘What’s the cause, what’s the reason why my light and vision of forms vanish?’ It occurred to me: ‘Doubt arose in me, and because of that my immersion fell away. When immersion falls away, the light and vision of forms vanish. I’ll make sure that doubt will not arise in me again.’

The way it's framed though, make it seem like the light and visions of forms are a good thing that may disappear on account of various mental faults. It also reminds me of the orthodox understanding of the nimitta. Any idea how we should interpret it ?

### Interesting parallel between sensuality and smoking addiction

Recently watched [Why did the Buddha say "sensuality" to be an assumption?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNotZXYWV-0)

One very interesting parallel of the talk is to Allen Carr's book on quitting smoking (Easy Way to Stop Smoking).  In that book he talks about the addicted cigarette smoker facing two monsters to overcome the addiction:  the Big Monster which is in charge of brainwashing, and the Little Monster which gives you cravings.

The crux of the book is in addressing the brainwashing.  The addicted smoker believes that the relief from the last cigarette is truly pleasurable, when it's simply the relieving of the craving for nicotine.  Because if it were truly pleasurable, then a smoker would derive pleasure even if they kept smoking incessantly without taking breaks in between, etc..  So, it's not really about pleasure, but topping up one's nicotine level to make up for the withdrawal induced by the last cigarette.  It's like purposely tying your shoelaces too tight because you enjoy the sensation of loosening them.  Therefore, the key to counter the brainwashing is to fully dispel the illusion of seeing the cigarette as desirable (in fact, in the book it suggests the reader to not stop smoking until they fully understand this point).

Obviously, the approach to sensuality is much, much broader in context, but I find the parallels to be rather astounding.  In that one needs to develop proper understanding and maintain the right context of sensuality being driven by the pain of craving (on top of the prerequisites of sense restraint, precepts, etc.), or else true dispassion will never develop.

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/18fgtv0/interesting_parallel_between_sensuality_and/kcvgam8/)** _2023-12-11 06:37:13_:

    The reason why we say that one must learn to *endure* the pressure of sensuality and not try to immediately get rid of those thoughts is because that's the only way one will get to address the actual "brainwashing" part, meaning the *view/assumption* that scratching the sensual itch is truly pleasant.

    If the cigarette addict were to just distract themselves with something else so that they forget about the desire to smoke, they wouldn't get to understand the real reason why the addiction should be given up, no matter how painful the withdrawal gets (or rather *because* of how painful it is). One day, even if it's many months later, they will end up smoking again once the secondary management approaches (meditation techniques and "observation" practices) stop working well enough, and it's the same with sensuality.

    That's what the Buddha meant by saying one needs to understand the gratification, danger, and *then* the escape from sensuality, but people are often just focused on getting the escape ASAP, which in the end means it's not an escape at all, but just sweeping the issue under the rug (like when your meditation is about getting rid of thinking and pondering, through which the the "itch" of sensuality is felt). And one can only come to understand the gratification and danger by enduring the pressure of the thoughts without acting out of it.

### Sotapanna's insight

Hello, in the latest video [Venerable Nyanamoli says](https://youtu.be/i5teUsZUSk0?t=1002): Sotapanna (and Ariya for that matter) knows all for all because he knows that "whatever has the nature to manifest, its manifestation is its ending, manifestation caries its end, **because it came on its own**".

As for the first part I don't really have an issue understanding that whatever manifested, because of its manifestation, that implies it is of impermanent nature, this is I believe what the Buddha taught with Anicca.

(1) Where it didn't click for me is the "because it came on its own", I'm sure it underlies and carries meaningful informations but the meaning is nebulous to me, what does it mean and implies?

&#x200B;

Also we are taught Sotapanna doesn't (and shouldn't) *conceive*, rather he knows, *conceiving* is explained in this manner (I hope I didn't miss further explanations of it):

\- [Here](https://youtu.be/i5teUsZUSk0?t=557) that phenomena are perceived as separate/independent, failing to understand the very sense of self assuming them as separate is undermined by these phenomena (dependent upon those phenomena (as well as the body) as a foundation for its existence??)

\- [Here](https://youtu.be/i5teUsZUSk0?t=931) that phenomena are not perceived as permanent, but known as impermanent through their manifestation

&#x200B;

(2) Does *conceiving* here solely means what has been listed (and what could be derived from these points)?

&#x200B;

I'm thinking for example about phenomena's nature of being unownable (which I believe a Sotapanna would *know*), this is something I came accross multiple times in insightful messages on this sub and I'm failing to recognize it for sure in this list.

But I'm also thinking maybe it can be derived from the first point: because the sense of self is dependent upon these phenomena (as well as the body) as a foundation for its very existence, it makes this sense of self unable to be the owner of this body, or of these phenomena; as well as the idea that phenomena are manifested through and only through the body, which is unownable, rendering them unownable.

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/18ey9bh/sotapannas_insight/kcs3zgo/)** _2023-12-10 16:25:28_:

    >(1) Where it didn't click for me is the "because it came on its own", I'm sure it underlies and carries meaningful informations but the meaning is nebulous to me, what does it mean and implies?

    >Also we are taught Sotapanna doesn't (and shouldn't) conceive, rather he knows, conceiving is explained in this manner (I hope I didn't miss further explanations of it):

    >\- Here that phenomena are perceived as separate/independent, failing to understand the very sense of self assuming them as separate is undermined by these phenomena (dependent upon those phenomena (as well as the body) as a foundation for its existence??)

    >\- Here that phenomena are not perceived as permanent, but known as impermanent through their manifestation

    Related to what u/fe_feron wrote, this can only be understood by *enduring* the pressure of experiences that come up, particularly the ones that result from undertaking the Gradual Training.

    The thing is that as a puthujjana, precisely due to not seeing the signs of one's mind, when one practices recognizing the impermanence of things, one is inevitably doing it on the level of rationalizing or explaining the nature of the experience, meaning that one is essentially *determining* things as impermanent on a very subtle level. That's what MN 2 means with "seeing not-self with self", and it's what will result from contemporary meditation practices generally, as they often involve gratuitously taking a certain "supramundane" *perception* (where you supposedly "observe" consciousness arising and breaking apart in a discontinuous stream) as an insight of anicca. One then *infers* that consciousness or anything else is impermanent *due to* that perception, and that's not an insight about the entire nature of perception, but just another "more special" perception that should equally be seen as impermanent and unownable. Hence the Sutta says that *even* if the puthujjana were to perceive Nibbāna itself, that experience would still be wrong for them, which is why they would not cease to be a puthujjana.

    Practically, seeing that "things are impermanent *because* of their manifestation" is accomplished by seeing the signs of one's mind, and that is also not something that you achieve by catching some *perceptions* or arisen thoughts about this or that. Not even feelings for that matter—the signs of the mind are on the level of what you are *doing* in regard to feelings and perceptions, on any level of subtlety. A good example would be giving in to doubt instead of allowing it to arise on its own for however long it wants, which is a subtle mental action. Once you're not acting out of the pressure on any level, which means you have at least temporarily put aside the conceivings, you get to recognize their true nature that was there from the start (hence abandoning hindrances, which are fueled by [actions](https://suttacentral.net/an10.61/en/sujato?lang=en), leads to understanding naturally). The tendency to act out is the most practically relevant manifestation of that assumption of "separateness".

    &#x200B;

    >(2) Does conceiving here solely means what has been listed (and what could be derived from these points)?

    Not at all. It refers to *any* experience whatsoever that may arise, which is why the Buddha went through so many specific instances, hammering the point that it doesn't matter *what* it is, even the loftiest "supramundane insights" people get out of their meditation. For a puthujjana *all* of it will be wrong because of the inability to not conceive in regard to and delight in *experience as such*.

### SN 8.4: "your mind is burning"

SN 8.4: "your mind is burning with lust due to an inversion of perception (i.e. things are in the wrong order)".

It is said that if the correct order is perceived the right view can be attained.

Bhikkhu Anigha briefly explained this sometime in the past. I want to reflect on this further, taking into account what I encounter on a daily basis. Either driving to and from work, walking on the street, at home doing stuff around the house etc. Is it possible?

Also how this is related to contemplating body in the body, feeling in the feeling etc?

Thank you
🙏

    >It is said that if the correct order is perceived the right view can be attained.

    I wouldn't use the word "perceived", as that tends to carry the notion that it's this special revelation that suddenly transforms you—a perception that frees you from perception by just having it, a contradiction. It's more like, when the right order is known for what it is beyond doubt, one has the Right View. Before that, one can see the right order to some extent but the fetter of doubt makes it not be fully right ultimately.

    >Bhikkhu Anigha briefly explained this sometime in the past. I want to reflect on this further, taking into account what I encounter on a daily basis. Either driving to and from work, walking on the street, at home doing stuff around the house etc. Is it possible?

    Assuming one is already not acting out of intentions of lust, aversion, and distraction by body and speech, the most basic way in which the order is inverted, one needs to recognize that it's not about establishing the right order anew with every individual thing and experience, which in the end would just mean dealing with objects. Rather, individual things and experiences come and go *within* that which is first, and one needs to learn over time to see even the subtlest aspects of one's experience in that manner, as secondary, such as one's most personal moods and internal attitudes. That's the domain that matters, not what's happening to you externally.

    For instance, you recognize how any mental state you might have, no matter how ambiguous and undefined it is, is *second* and the body and senses are *first*, because even such a subtle experience could not possibly arise if there were no sense objects to have moods in regard to. And then whether you walk, stand, sit or lie down, it doesn't matter for as long as you don't forget that "order" and re-establish it when you lose it.

    It's also important to note that it *must not* be any more specific and detailed than this. The moment one starts trying to pin it down into details is when one is already putting specific thoughts first and the context second, perverting the order. So instead of trying to figure out further details, one needs to put in the effort to clarify one's notions of what a "mental state" even is, for example, as even that is not sufficiently recognized by a puthujjana.

    The lack of familiarity with the very phenomena the instruction is pointing towards (and that one already is and always has been experiencing but ignorantly) is the reason why one can't practice correctly, not that the instruction needs to be more detailed.

### How does right effort fit in with "endurance of cravings"?

In the past I have heard Thai Forest monks and others say that part of right effort is to recognize an unwholesome thought and to get rid of it, to replace it with something else that is wholesome.  Like a carpenter would drive a rough peg out of a chair with a more refined peg, or something like that.

My understanding of part of Ajahn Nyanamoli's teachings is that - when there is a craving, instead of giving in, or replacing the craving with something else, or distracting myself from the craving with something else, I should allow the craving to be there, to endure it.

Am I understanding that part of AN's teaching correctly?  If so, can you please point out how this isn't a contradiction with right effort, or where I'm missing something.  Thanks very much,

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/18cg91i/how_does_right_effort_fit_in_with_endurance_of/kcc1gtq/)** _2023-12-07 06:01:32_:

    >My understanding of part of Ajahn Nyanamoli's teachings is that - when there is a craving, instead of giving in, or replacing the craving with something else, or distracting myself from the craving with something else, I should allow the craving to be there, to endure it.

    You could phrase it that way depending on the context, but it's also important to recognize that you're not literally being told to allow unwholesome states to continue unchecked, as that would be taking it too far. Rather, the point is that whatever is taking place when you endure the *pressure* of a mental state correctly (which is what a puthujjana needs to learn to stop being a puthujjana) cannot be called craving anymore, regardless of that fact that it won't "feel right" to you initially. Because of that, it's better to say that you're supposed to endure the mental pressure, not "craving".

    Craving is basically the deeply-rooted tendency of wanting to *respond* to pressure, whether positively or negatively. The (practicing) puthujjana's misconception is precisely in confusing pressure with unwholesomeness and trying to get rid of it, or also confusing acting out of pressure with wholesomeness in some cases. The attempt to endure the pressure instead will not be perfect initially, but it will not entail as course of a mistake as these two extremes.

    &#x200B;

    >Like a carpenter would drive a rough peg out of a chair with a more refined peg, or something like that.

    People don't even contemplate the simile carefully, and it actually reinforces our point. This is the first simile in MN 20. When you have a certain, say, sensual thought that is pressuring you, replacing it with something else is exactly like using a peg that is just as course, meaning you end up with just a different form of the same problem (you removed the sensuality which is welcoming the pressure, but are now left with aversion towards the pressure, and the "amount" of craving did not even diminish, it just "morphed"). The "finer peg" would be establishing a peripheral context that does not deny what has arisen, but also prevents you from welcoming what has arisen, and that can only be achieved through that *endurance* of the pressure. That context could even be the second reflection that is explained in that very sutta (and in MN 19 as well).

    Each subsequent "strategy" in MN 20 is actually happening within the first, so even in the last one, where you're supposed to clench your teeth and "crush mind with mind", you won't be doing that rightly and it won't result in abandoning of unwholesome as it says it should if that "crushing mind with mind" is being done as a form of *replacing* what is arisen with something just as coarse. That's why it says it's like a stronger man would beat down a weaker man \*from above (\*from his head or shoulders). The stronger man doesn't get into a *fistfight* face-to-face with the weaker man, which is what people usually do. Not only with this strategy but with all of them, including the first.

### An interesting translation of Yoniso Manasikara that I think would be appreciated here.

We are all familiar with the more common translations of yoniso manasikara being rational/wise/careful etc. attention but I came across one that is close to what we're all familiar with here.

Michael Olds translates SN.I.iv:4 as "It is through mentally tracing things back to their origins, by making the effort to track paths to their sources, beggars, that I have reached incomparable freedom, seen incomparable freedom with my own eyes."

Which is a much more practicable translation than everyone I've seen except HH's.

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/18cebpu/an_interesting_translation_of_yoniso_manasikara/kcbz4mb/)** _2023-12-07 05:36:31_:

    It's a bit less watered down than "rational, wise, careful", but technically it's still inaccurate even just based on the Pali. Yoniso means "according to; by means of", which is very different from the directionality involved pretty much all modern translations (and ways of practice as well). You don't try to "look at" the origin/source, and "tracking things back to their origins" carries that implication, but rather you attend to things *according to* the source, which is already there if you know how to recognize it. You could also say "according to the cause", but "cause" must be understood in a strictly present and simultaneous sense, meaning that which is the necessary basis for what you're attending to while you're attending to it. That's how one discerns *paṭiccasamuppāda:* as [SN 12.67](https://suttacentral.net/sn12.67/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin) puts it, it's akin to two bundles of reeds holding each other up. There is no temporal "sequence" involved, which would wrongly be implied in the "tracking things back" translation.

    Hence Ajahn Nyanamoli translated it as "concurrent attention" in his book on jhāna. This [essay](https://www.hillsidehermitage.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/The-Meaning-of-Yoniso-Manasikara-Bhikkhu-Anigha.pdf) goes into the principle of yoniso manasikāra in-depth.

### Why is it that greed, aversion, delusion will go away with the right context?

In various talks, it has been expressed that if one were contemplating the nature of things in the right order/context, then greed, aversion, delusion will naturally subside, given that one is already practicing sense restraint, keeping the 8 precepts, etc. (apologies for any poor paraphrasing).  Why/how is this the case?  Is it because with the right context in mind, the "I-making" / "self-making" is (gradually) reduced, resulting in decreasing appropriation of sensual pleasures and concomitant increase in dispassion?

And is it fair to say that as long as there is greed, aversion, and delusion, then one is definitely not practicing with the right context?  Or does greed, aversion, and delusion take time to diminish even if one is practicing right context correctly?

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/18ao7tb/why_is_it_that_greed_aversion_delusion_will_go/kc33po5/)** _2023-12-05 12:20:32_:

    It's because greed, aversion, and delusion (rāga-dosa-moha) all have their roots in ignorance (avijjā), so when there is knowledge instead of ignorance, they cannot remain. Those 3 things are basically just *symptoms* of ignorance, which is the core illness.

    In the case you mention of sensual pleasures, it's the ignorance of their true nature, as impermanent and unsatisfactory, that makes one have lust for them in the first place. So that's why one should not be trying to get rid of lust directly, but only re-establish the right context regarding whatever one is lustful about, and so, again, treat the illness of ignorance instead of its symptoms.

    >And is it fair to say that as long as there is greed, aversion, and delusion, then one is definitely not practicing with the right context? Or does greed, aversion, and delusion take time to diminish even if one is practicing right context correctly?

    If the context is *truly* there (which can only be the case for a person with the Right View and thus Right Recolletion), the 3 poisons cannot be there at that moment. What takes time to diminish is the *liability* to greed, aversion, and delusion, meaning that while a sotāpanna or higher trainee can get rid of them in a finger-snap through the right context, they will still come back eventually. That's what is referred to as "underlying tendencies".

### Yoniso Manasikāra and not wanting to endure whatever perception

Hello, as I was finishing reading "[The Meaning of Yoniso Manasikara](https://www.hillsidehermitage.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/The-Meaning-of-Yoniso-Manasikara-Bhikkhu-Anigha.pdf)" by Bhante Anigha I came accross the 6th point conveying the following idea:

&#x200B;

>So, one has to remind oneself and re-establish recollection only when the context has clearly been lost, not all the time neurotically. Then you also get to see that "losing the context" is a choice, because you are within that container, you are within the body even if you don’t think about it, so only ignorant choices by which the primacy of the "womb" is clearly disregarded and ownership is implied, can actually make you believe that you are the first, the master, and the womb is second. For example, it is impossible to seek pleasing experiences for the sake of sensual gratification or act out of indignation towards disagreeable experiences without tacitly assuming that you are the owner of the six senses and body. This is how you would automatically ignore, through your superficially unrelated actions, that this notion of "I" and "mine" is actually within that body and thus cannot truly possess it—and this is how yoniso manasikāra would be forsaken and ayoniso become established.  
>  
>The foremost obstacle to yoniso manasikāra is nothing other than one's own lack of restraint and unwholesome choices  
>  
>\[...\]  
>  
>Thus, if you simply recollect the context and know that the yoni is there, and doesn't become overly engaged with whatever comes within that "womb", including thoughts, you have not lost the recollection, even without actively thinking about it. Even if your mind is trying to hinder you and cause you doubt to revisit and rehash all your Dhamma knowledge, that's still not an excuse to put the doubt first and the yoni second. **If the context is there, the discomfort of whatever perceptions and mental states come within that needs to be endured—not wanting to endure it would put you "outside of the womb". You would willingly delight in "birth" again, and further sustain ignorance.**

&#x200B;

(1) Is the fact that not wanting to endure and acting out of discomfort from whatever perception or mental state puts me "outside of the womb" because that would mean I'm identifying with the feeling or perception, or identifying as the one feeling or perceiving?

&#x200B;

(2) I'm imagining how I could apply that to something trivial as having the knee hurting more and more when staying crosslegged for too long.

Can I  —or rather, does that mean I should— endure that pain and not move to release the discomfort just by dismissing it as not being "my" pain but another feeling that doesn't belong to me in any way and that is not important, ~~even though its existence is "felt more than real", I can't deny it,~~ *(my bad it has nothing to do with denying its existence)* and my attention struggles to focus on anything else even though I keep this body being the womb of that experience as the context?

Would moving to release the pain be a choice to lose the context and be ayoniso manasikāra?

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/18aldfa/yoniso_manasikāra_and_not_wanting_to_endure/kc32csa/)** _2023-12-05 12:05:46_:

    >(1) Is the fact that not wanting to endure and acting out of discomfort from whatever perception or mental state puts me "outside of the womb" because that would mean I'm identifying with the feeling or perception, or identifying as the one feeling or perceiving?

    The latter, although ultimately the whole reason why the assumption of self is gratuitous is because that sense of an "entity" that is feeling or perceiving is *also* just a feeling and perception of a subtler kind, which gets confused with it being more fundamental than the other feelings and perceptions, which is isn't. The sense of self is real, it's basically "the point of view that makes the choices" to put it colloquially, but the point is that *that* is also within the five aggregates, and it's still impermanent, suffering and unownable, just like everything else.

    >(2) I'm imagining how I could apply that to something trivial as having the knee hurting more and more when staying crosslegged for too long.  
    >

    >

    You should certainly not be overly concerned with avoiding bodily discomfort, but that's not really the level where yoniso manasikāra applies. It's on the level of mental states, such as the one that's pushing you to not move when your knee hurts, thinking that that's somehow contributing to purification of mind. You would get more out of questioning that entire attitude than just going through with that coarse, and ultimately arbitrary determination (because why not go further and stop breathing? why stop at enduring the pain in your knees?)

### Contact is just “contact” for the Arahant?

I listened to H.H.’s talk on Suttas entitled, “Overcome the Pressure”. It’s an older talk. The Bhūmija Sutta, SN 12.25 is featured for discussion. 

In the talk, patticasamuppada is discussed and Ajahn Nyanamoli seems to use the word “pressure” as a replacement for ”contact”.

Question: I think he saying that for the pathujjana, contact with the senses IS automatically “pressure” (pressure to act out of feeling), whereas for the Arahant, contact with the senses is simply contact with the senses.
…Hence, for the Arahant, “the seen is just the seen, the heard is just the heard”, etc.

Did I understand this correctly?
Thank you

Edit: corrected the title of the talk

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/18aix9a/contact_is_just_contact_for_the_arahant/kbyamih/)** _2023-12-04 13:48:01_:

    You could say that "contact is just contact" for the mind (citta) of the Arahant, but as far as the senses go, pressure remains pressure like before. As SN 35.228 explains, the Arahant, the one who has "gone beyond", has done so because they *withstand* the current of the 6 oceans, not because there is no current anymore. The latter is what people tend to implicitly misunderstand with the phrase "X is just X for an Arahant", which in theory is not wrong in itself, but  being a puthujjana *means* not being able to even fathom what an Arahant is, so one must not forget that whatever explanation of an Arahant one hears will not be truly seen until one has the Right View.

    Without the Right View, one cannot see the Middle Way, so if one hears that "there is no pressure for an Arahant", one will "overshoot" one's abandonment of the pressure to the point of interfering with phenomena that are not unwholesome, whereas if one hears "there is still pressure for an Arahant", the opposite will happen, and one will not be recognizing impurities as impurities.

    So in the end, what matters most is to not take one's present understanding for granted, not to have the right idea right off the bat, which is impossible without seeing the Dhamma for oneself.

### breath is default object!!

I understand and am not doing breath observation as a goal. 

However I found that when there is no thought. naturally breath comes in foreground. and becomes object of attention. and it is peaceful too. I am also open to any thoughts. and I am watchful of my intention etc. however many time I find myself resting in breath observation.

is that ok. or some kind of delusion.?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

  


- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/18adwc6/breath_is_default_object/kbxv8et/)** _2023-12-04 11:15:26_:

    As you put it, this is "breath observation", which is an entirely different thing from Anapanasati. It's "OK" for as long as you don't think that that's getting you any closer to understanding the Dhamma, but that's not usually the view people have. They think they're practicing Anapanasati/satipaṭṭhānas by doing that, and *that* is the delusion.

    Anapanasati is about discerning the body, feelings, mind and thoughts while you are breathing, not about observing your breath or bodily sensations (although of course those things come up on their own; the point is to not think they're somehow important). The former is yoniso manasikāra; the latter is the opposite. The former is the [abiding of the Tathāgata](https://suttacentral.net/sn54.11/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=linebyline&reference=none&notes=sidenotes&highlight=false&script=latin); the latter can perfectly well be taught by a mere psychotherapist.

    &#x200B;

    Edit: Also, the breath is not a "default object", as the title says. The *breathing body* is a background to whatever object arises, and the sensations of breathing involved in "breath observation" are just one among that infinite range of secondary objects, and there is nothing special about them.

### Wouldn't you need a healthy sense of self to navigate an abuse situation?

... is the question my therapist asked when I started sharing my interest in buddhism and explaining the concepts.

She is starting to get very interested in it too and is asking me questions like this to guage my understanding.

I still cannot answer this question. The western psychological literature does show that people with low self-esteem, failure to maintain boundaries, fear of abandonment etc. struggle immensely to escape from abusive situations. Psychotherapy aims to improve one's sense of self-worth and self-esteem, understanding of what healthy boundaries are to ultimately equip the person with the understanding and knowledge necessary to escape abuse.

My poor attempt at answering this question:

Fear of abandonment is rooted in craving - craving against the unpleasant feeling of abandonment, an idea which implies a sense of 'self'. If there was no sense of self felt, there would be nobody who would feel abandoned.

Failure to maintain boundaries is rooted in both ignorance and craving - ignorance of the fact that the choices you make to allow people to overstep your boundaries are pressured by craving for various things e.g. external validation. Failure to maintain boundaries is once again a subtle attempt at getting rid of the unpleasant feeling caused by the pressures of various unwholesome state (e.g. aversion towards abandonment, aversion towards angering the abuser)  which only leads to further suffering.

poor self-esteem is pretty much having very negative opinions about yourself and why you might 'deserve' to be in an abusive situation. If you feel that you deserve to be abused, you become averse to the idea of being free from abuse.

Besides the management vs uprooting of dukkha, it seems to me that there are many similarities between monastic practice and psychotherapy when it comes to the \*actions\* you must take to free yourself from suffering, which all boil down to understanding the nature of your actions, recognising that ultimately you have to endure the discomfort and start practising the right actions no matter what thoughts and feelings might sway you otherwise.

So I'm thinking that a negative, unhealthy sense of self isn't the root cause of one's struggle to get out of an abusive situation. The negative view is just a symptom of the underlying illness - the self! If one extinguished their feeling of self, there would be no breeding ground for feeling abandoned, or having negative opinions about one's 'self'. The person would become aware of their responsibility to cultivate awareness, essentially practise a form of sense restraint and ensure they make the right actions despite the enduring unpleasant feelings that they feel.

But then the question becomes, if one had completely lost their sense of self, why would they crave to get OUT of an abusive situation if they are not resistant to the unpleasant feeling of being abused? This highlights my confusion with the motivations of an arahant when it comes to preserving their own life.

Another question is, why is having a healthy sense of self problematic compared to the ultimate goal of losing your sense of self altogether? Is this a management vs uprooting issue too? Are there traps that come with having a healthy sense of self where further dukkha is revealed?

Lastly, I imagine someone who gets into buddhism with a healthy skepticism might accept non-identification with the six sense base, but they might then say "aha! the self is that within you that makes these choices to either go with or against the grain of these pulling senses. Your autonomy is what the self is, and you need a healthy sense of self to realise that you have to go against the grain of your feelings to get of the abuse!"

This is where my already limited understanding falls apart. I would appreciate help on this as I know it would highlight major gaps in my knowledge I can start improving on!

&#x200B;

P.S. I myself escaped domestic abuse, so if there are any questions you have about my actual experience that you think could be used as examples to illustrate the buddhist view, please absolutely ask away.

    As others have pointed out, the main issue with this is the underlying misconception of what *anattā* is.

    Self-esteem and the extent of one's boundaries are not on the same level as Arahantship and an Arahant does not stop manifesting those things externally. One Arahant might tend to have firmer boundaries and appear sterner externally, while another may appear to some like a pushover. And that's just based on the habits that they had developed before even taking up the practice (although the forms of enforcing boundaries or of failing to do so that were rooted in anger or fear respectively would disappear).

    &#x200B;

    >But then the question becomes, if one had completely lost their sense of self, why would they crave to get OUT of an abusive situation if they are not resistant to the unpleasant feeling of being abused? This highlights my confusion with the motivations of an arahant when it comes to preserving their own life.

    One does not "lose" one's sense of self. That's not what the Suttas say. The Suttas say that one recognizes that the five aggregates are not worth taking as mine because they are impermanent and suffering. That may sound the same due to the contemporary wrong views that have muddled the Dhamma, but they're very different. "Losing" one's sense of self is the extreme of denial while recognizing that things are "unownable", as we like to say, is the Middle Way.

    The idea that you "lose" your sense of self is actually still rooted in the unenlightened mind's misunderstanding of the self being possible to pin down to some specific thing, which is the only way you could "lose" it like you lose your car keys or something. But the suttas say that what one loses is upādāna (translated by us as "assumption"), in this case, the assumption of a view of self. So what one does is abandon a gratuitous *view/assumption* that was not even supposed to be there and was incompatible with the five aggregates all along. The idea of "losing" the sense of self already implies one misconceives it to be somehow "in" the five aggregates since that's the domain where gain and loss apply.

    &#x200B;

    >Here, householder, the uninstructed worldling, who is not a seer of the noble ones and is unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma, who is not a seer of superior persons and is unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma, regards form as self, or self as possessing form, or form as in self, or self as in form.

    SN 22.1

    Thus, that which there used to be a view of self in regard to retains the capacity to intend to get out of abusive situations or anything of that sort when there is no good reason to put up with it.

    Because of this, the idea of having a "healthy sense of self" does not even apply and is unjustifiable. The view of self establishes itself in regard to the five aggregates, and for a puthujjana who takes the five aggregates as theirs, what they're really saying when they think of "healthy sense of self" is a healthy *view* of self, and that is nothing but an oxymoron. The view of self makes one's entire existence unhealthy/unwholesome, while the absence of that view makes the experience of a noble individual automatically healthy, regardless of what takes place within it and how much they may choose to avoid certain situations that cause unnecessary suffering, or to put up with them if there is a purpose.

    >Lastly, I imagine someone who gets into buddhism with a healthy skepticism might accept non-identification with the six sense base, but they might then say "aha! the self is that within you that makes these choices to either go with or against the grain of these pulling senses. Your autonomy is what the self is, and you need a healthy sense of self to realise that you have to go against the grain of your feelings to get of the abuse!"

    No, making choices is not what the view of self is about. The view of self is established in regard to the making of choices, which is an affair of the aggregates and does not need to involve craving. A puthujjana does not see this, and they either overly intend the choices and take them as theirs or try to not make choices so as to not have the view of self. They can't see the Middle Way whereby choices are left where they always were and to the same extent without being appropriated in any way.

### Question on discerning the right order and Anapanasati Sutta

When breathing in/out sensitive to the entire body, does it matter if one experiences the breath or the whole body as that which peripheral/in the background? In my attempts at practicing in accordance with this sutta, I, at times, experience the knowledge that the in/out breath is occurring in the background while the feelings associated with the entire body along with the perception of the body occupy the foreground. At other times, however, I experience the knowledge that the body is sitting in the background while the feelings associated with breath along with the perception of the breath occupy the foreground. Despite the seeming reversal in what occupies the background and foreground foreground, it seems to me that in both cases rupa is discerned as the more fundamental aggregate upon which vedana and sanna depend. Am I discerning things correctly by looking at it accordingly?

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/189gorp/question_on_discerning_the_right_order_and/kbulddh/)** _2023-12-03 19:07:35_:

    To add to what u/no_thingness wrote, what the Ānāpānasatisutta is referring to with "experiencing the whole body" is absolutely not what people usually expect,  which leads to the contemporary practices that conflate attending to what is essentially just *more* bodily sensations with what the Buddha is here instructing (and which also turns [the meditation of the Tathāgata](https://suttacentral.net/sn54.11/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin) into something quite trivial that anyone and their grandma can do with just a bit of instruction and practice).

    "Whole body"  refers to the "place" where the aggregate of form is recognized in its totality, and, although that *does* involve every part of your body in a secondary sense, it is impossible that you will ever be able to reach that recognition of the whole body *through* specific body parts and sensations.

    MN 28 clearly states that the sixth sense base, whose experiences are often not even acknowledged as being equally real as the objects of the 5 senses by many "meditators", also gives rise to form/rūpa. *And that is also part of the "whole body" that one is supposed to discern*. Not only that, but one sees the breathing as the background of *even that,* meaning that one's recognition of the breath is even subtler than those already subtle mental phenomena. "Subtle" here means structurally more fundamental and thus *overlooked* in favor of the more "palpable" objects, despite that foundation being there the whole time; it's not that you are perceiving some sort of "new reality" that wasn't there before, which would just be another perception within the same not-fundamental-enough level of experience (and people usually mistake things happening on that level for insight or liberation).

### The Jhāna Method (Sutta)

>“Before my enlightenment, while I was just a bodhisatta, not yet fully enlightened, it occurred to me too: ‘Good is renunciation, good is solitude.’ Yet my mind did not launch out upon renunciation and become placid, settled, and liberated in it, though I saw it as peaceful. It occurred to me: ‘Why is it that my mind does not launch out upon renunciation and become placid, settled, and liberated in it, though I see it as peaceful?’ Then it occurred to me: ***‘I have not seen the danger in sensual pleasures and have not cultivated that; I have not achieved the benefit in renunciation and have not  pursued it. Therefore my mind does not launch out upon renunciation and become placid, settled, and liberated in it, though I see it as peaceful.’

>“Then, Ānanda, it occurred to me: ‘If, having seen the danger in sensual pleasures, I would cultivate that, and if, having achieved the benefit in renunciation, I would pursue it, it is then possible that my mind would launch out upon renunciation and become placid, settled, and liberated in it, since I see it as peaceful.’ Sometime later, ***having seen the danger in sensual pleasures, I cultivated that, and having achieved the benefit in renunciation, I pursued it. My mind then launched out upon renunciation and became placid, settled, and liberated in it, since I saw it as peaceful.***

>“Sometime later, Ānanda, secluded from sensual pleasures … I entered and dwelled in the first jhāna. While I was dwelling in this state, perception and attention accompanied by sensuality occurred in me and I felt it as an affliction. Just as pain might arise for one feeling pleasure only to afflict him, so too, ***when perception and attention accompanied by sensuality occurred in me, [I felt it as an affliction....](https://suttacentral.net/mn19/en/bodhi?lang=en)***

### Confused as the difference between sati and yoniso manisakara

After watching this video : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI0GVhw0bgs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI0GVhw0bgs) it seems like sati and yoniso manisakara are more or less the same thing and are a bit overlapping, so I must be wrong somewhere...

According to the video sati is remembering the context, in which case how would it be different from yoniso manisakara ?

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/187s9ba/confused_as_the_difference_between_sati_and/kbif492/)** _2023-12-01 05:18:52_:

    sati is more general than yoniso manasikāra and everybody has it to some extent. Without it, you basically couldn't do anything. That's why the implicit perception of sati as some new thing you need to start practicing when you become a "meditator" is misguided. People might tell themselves that they always have sati out of common sense, but the practice that they're doing *is* ultimately an artificial construct regardless, and it requires interfering with the way that experience naturally works, which is the same both with and without ignorance.  

    yoniso manasikāra is what turns ordinary sati into actual satipaṭṭhānas and sammāsati, as it allows the recollection to sustain the perspective about the foundation of one's experience, thus opening up the possibility of eventually discerning paṭiccasamuppāda.

    Thus, yoniso manasikāra (and the utterance of another) is the condition for the arising of the Right View (= Right Recollection).

### The Non Sensual .. Thought ?

Theruwan saranayai !

This is a question I've had for maybe a month now, but upon being unable still to resolve it myself I will ask it here. 

There is a certain concept I've been seeing talked about in HH videos, as well as sometimes on here, namely the concept: Wholesome is not another "object" (like for example, thoughts of "wishing others well"), but rather, Wholesome is simply clarity in regards to the UNWHOLESOME OBJECT.  

For example, in the video the Ultimate Method for Overcoming Hindrances - ( https://youtu.be/9voIhZij5Io?si=E0hU-wk5sNQhZ5Zq ) at 27:00 minutes in, Sister Medhini mentions how in the Dvedhavitakka Sutta, the Thought of Renunciation/ Non - Sensual Thought is not just another object like the Sensual Thought is.

 Rather, what constitutes the Nekkhamma vitakka/Thought of Renunciation is:

 "the type of THINKING of seeing the danger of the Sensual Thought that has arisen". 

Although it does make sense that an object could not simply be Wholesome in and of itself in its own arising, manifestation, and nature - thoughts that arise about a certain content just so happen to be good, and thoughts about a certain content just so happen to be bad (by that logic, when Arițțha the Vulture Trapper was at some point thinking about the suttas - that was also "wholesome" - since how could thoughts concerning the suttas possibly be bad??) - what I have trouble understanding is this:

1.)  From what I can understand of the Dvedhavitakka Sutta, it seems to imply that the Thought of Renunciation IS in fact, Wholesome IN ITS ARISING and IS a wholesome OBJECT. 

"Then, as I meditated - diligent, keen, and resolute - a thought of renunciation AROSE. I understood: 'This thought of renunciation has ARISEN in me'". 

It doesn't say that intentionally, volitionally THINKING and clarifying the danger of the arisen Sensual Thought is the Thought of Renunciation, but that the thought that ARISES (before and more fundamental to your intentional thinking/contemplation/clarification) is IN ITSELF, in its original nature and manifestation BEFORE your contemplation of it - a Thought of Renunciation.  

In short, the Wholesome Thought is a Wholesome THOUGHT - NOT Wholesome THINKING (which is what contemplating and reflecting upon the danger would be). 

Perhaps I may be conflating this in assuming that for the Thought of Renunciation to be wholesome in its ARISING, Wholesome must therefore be an "object"/ dependent on the content of the thought. Maybe it could be seen instead as - WHATEVER CONTENT that arises regardless of the object, whether it arises/manifests with DESIRE backing it or not - is what determines the nature of the thought? 

2.) If the Thought of Renunciation is really just contemplation of the danger of an arisen Sensual Thought - this renders about half the Dvedhavitakka sutta completely useless and unnecessary. 

The first part of the sutta is about when the Bodhisatta, while meditating, has a Sensual Thought arise in him, and he then contemplates on its danger. 

If this contemplation of the danger of the Sensual Thought - is the Non-Sensual "Thought" in itself, the Bodhisatta could have stopped right here (since he has already explained the two classes of thought). 

But then he also goes on, in the second part, to reflect on the BENEFITS of arisen Thoughts of Renunciation (so if the contemplation of the danger of a Sensual Thought constitutes a Non-Sensual Thought.... what exactly does that make this?). 
- - - 

I will have to mention that all of this may be due to my lack of clarity in regards to Sensual thoughts and what they really are, as well. Maybe this is all wrong and neither the Non-Sensual Thought NOR the Sensual Thought even - are defined by the object of the thought, but simply by the presence/absence of desire? This would seem to sort out the issue? 

I do apologize for my long question and if it is unclear. Thank you!

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1878ut3/the_non_sensual_thought/kbdoftf/)** _2023-11-30 08:13:48_:

    What the "wholesome thoughts" are cannot be understood accurately in theory alone because wholesomeness on that level that *arises on its own* is rooted in the present state of mind, which is not in your direct control. On that level, you can't at the same time relate to unwholesome thoughts *and* wholesome thoughts—it has to be one of the two that you exist within at the time. That "level" is what determines where the mind will go if you just relax and don't make any effort. 

    A background unwholesome citta is facing the direction of unwholesome actions by default, including by manokamma, and restraining yourself from that "pull" will be painful. A fully established wholesome state of mind, on the other hand, makes unwholesome actions impossible even if you try to commit them, because losing the perspective of danger is inconceivable for as long as that state lasts, and it makes not acting out of the pull be joyful and satisfying in a way that involves no craving. 

    For instance, choosing to eat the most delicious food instead of something simple could not possibly be rooted in sensual desire at that time unlike before, where you'd have to be extra careful to the point of abstaining from it if the mind is craving for the pleasure, or making sure that there is a valid practical reason for consuming it. You'd be able to experience the full "size" of the pleasure of the delicious food and still see it as a charcoal pit and not crave for it at all, and same with thoughts and memories about sense pleasures in general. (Sexual engagement of any kind remains perpetually and categorically out of bounds though).

    >1.)  From what I can understand of the Dvedhavitakka Sutta, it seems to imply that the Thought of Renunciation IS in fact, Wholesome IN ITS ARISING and IS a wholesome OBJECT. 

    >"Then, as I meditated - diligent, keen, and resolute - a thought of renunciation AROSE. I understood: 'This thought of renunciation has ARISEN in me'". 

    >It doesn't say that intentionally, volitionally THINKING and clarifying the danger of the arisen Sensual Thought is the Thought of Renunciation, but that the thought that ARISES (before and more fundamental to your intentional thinking/contemplation/clarification) is IN ITSELF, in its original nature and manifestation BEFORE your contemplation of it - a Thought of Renunciation.

    Yes, you can imagine it in theory as how much pressure there is to __act__ out of the content (craving) vs. how much pressure the content __is__ by itself (feeling). It is by not seeing the difference between those two that one remains caught up in saṁsāra, pretty much. Not seeing that recognizing that craving is completely gratuitous, while feeling is not optional. And again, that will only be seen once the practice that the Buddha is describing there in MN 19 is brought to fulfilment, so that one can drop the active thinking of renunciation and stay only with the *mental state* of renunciation that is now steady and does not require any maintenance at all. Otherwise, craving and hindrances will always be the mental state to some extent and all of one's active Dhamma reflections will still not be "on the right level".

    >2.) If the Thought of Renunciation is really just contemplation of the danger of an arisen Sensual Thought - this renders about half the Dvedhavitakka sutta completely useless and unnecessary. 

    >The first part of the sutta is about when the Bodhisatta, while meditating, has a Sensual Thought arise in him, and he then contemplates on its danger.

    >But then he also goes on, in the second part, to reflect on the BENEFITS of arisen Thoughts of Renunciation (so if the contemplation of the danger of a Sensual Thought constitutes a Non-Sensual Thought.... what exactly does that make this?). 

    Yes, that second part is also just as important, and it's the same principle as contemplating the benefit of abandoning hindrances shown in Suttas like MN 39.

    Basically, once you start properly contemplating the danger—namely, you are trying to address your gratuitous need to *act out* of the pressure, not the pressure itself—the mind will begin to recognize the danger more by itself when the same things keep arising (i.e. whatever the mind is thinking about which you don't try to interfere with—as the simile goes, the cowherd doesn't put the cows on a leash, he just makes sure they don't eat other people's crops). You then need to actively foster that recognition of benefit so as to solidify that *mental state* of renunciation at the background, not to, again, do something to the *content* in any way.

    Also, you could say that that which the Sutta does not explicitly name, being the contemplation of "this does not lead to my benefit, etc." is the "active thinking" that you are using to, as the Sutta also says, incline that *citta/mental state* in the right direction. Ceasing to make use of that reflection prematurely would entail allowing the wrong mental states to continue. Not realizing that it's that indirect mental state and not the direct experience of feeling and perception that needs to change will also mean no purification of mind, and proliferation of subtle aversion towards feelings instead.

    Furthermore, the part that people often misinterpret, where the Buddha says "this thinking is tiresome, why don't I stop it", has an important nuance in Pāli. The expression is "__anu-__vitakkayato __anu-__vicārayato", and that "anu" is denoting the  "(going) along with" nature of those active reflections, which is tiresome compared to allowing the wholesome mental state coupled with whatever feelings or perceptions arise to endure effortlessly. It does *not* mean that he stopped the vitakkavicāra as such that is paired with renunciation, etc., because that can only be done by either falling back into unwholesome thoughts or by entering the second jhāna.

    >Maybe this is all wrong and neither the Non-Sensual Thought NOR the Sensual Thought even - are defined by the object of the thought, but simply by the presence/absence of desire? This would seem to sort out the issue? 

    Yes, pretty much. Of course, even the senses will eventually incline less to the very coarse objects if the wholesome citta/mental state is protected, but that absolutely does not and should not involve volition on your part. That would be a way of trying to take a shortcut to the second jhāna pretty much, which will make you fall from the first if you had it and [end up with neither](https://suttacentral.net/an9.35/en/sujato).

    At the end of the day, you can speak of wholesome and unwholesome both on the active and the passive level, but it's not perfectly clear cut. If the intention behind the superficially wholesome thoughts is unwholesome, they won't actually be wholesome. And if there is truly a wholesome intention at the back, nothing that arises can be said to be unwholesome *at that moment*. You can also have reached some level of a wholesome mental state, but then allow yourself then attend to sense objects carelessly on a particular level (which will still not be causing any suffering due to the pure mind), and this will gradually incline the mind back into unwholesome.

    [This](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=VBiB0W7U6FQ) and [this](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7DqygBzFlo) are also about this same Sutta.

### Discerning the body

Hello, in *The Only Way to Jhana* Venerable Nyanamoli addresses a chapter about *Discerning the body* as an entity there enduring on its own with his own cravings and that we should be "aware of it as a peripherally enduring bag of skin. An indirect image of the body that contains the sense organs that are attracted to the various types of sense pleasures in their respective domains".

&#x200B;

My "issue" here is that I tend to understand what is meant but not on the level of the body but rather of the brain (or mind).

I feel like I've been partially making myself aware of something peripherally enduring for a long time now with what I call "mental training", essentially *going against the grain* of the mind and "going beyond the limits of what I can endure" or I guess in my mind it was rather trying some watered-down shaolin type of training to become the master of the mind, to be less controlled by it but gain more control over it. Little things like for example when doing sport, by not giving up and enduring when it gets hard physically; or endure the cold until the mind is not bothered by it anymore even though it feels it; or when I feel like the mind gets antsy or frustrated, by not following it where it wants to go.

Also, for a long time now, probably because of our understanding of the self according to science, I was thinking of myself as a brain, a brain which is connected to a body and able to pilote it partially (at least at the level of the muscles).

&#x200B;

And all in all, I tend not to experience that awareness at the level of the body enduring on its own, but rather at the level of the brain, or the mind, enduring everything the body sends to it, on its own. Which translates into, for example, not thinking this is the tongue that wants good feeling with good tasting food but rather the mind that wants to feel delight with good taste by proxy of the tongue, or this is not the body that is cold and wants to be warm, but rather the mind that is averse to the coldness by proxy of the body.

&#x200B;

So I would just like to know if this is a mistake and if this is important that I recalibrate this way of perceiving things to not possibly get things wrong as I go further into the practice, or, if maybe the important point is rather to see something here, over than "me", enduring on its own and pulling me one way or another, be it the body and the senses or the mind by proxy of the body and the senses?

I tend to think that if Ajahn Nyanamoli puts it in those specific terms of "body" and "sense organs" and not of "mind" that's for a good reason, but I would like opinions from people more expert than me on the subject

&#x200B;

Edit: After putting it in writing, pondering about it gets easier and I'm starting to wonder if that was just too nebulous for me, because when I give the example of not giving up when doing physical exercises and that it gets difficult and physical pain arises, this is the mind not giving up by discerning the body as an individual entity going through a painful process, not the mind not giving up by discerning the mind feeling a painful process, right? I'm lost  😅

    >So I would just like to know if this is a mistake and if this is important that I recalibrate this way of perceiving things to not possibly get things wrong as I go further into the practice

    It is, and that's why it's such an issue when people think the views about the practice are irrelevant and dismiss the need to clear out misunderstandings by saying "that's all just thinking" and whatnot, and the only thing that matters is "meditation" (which, in the original, uncorrupted meaning of the word, is literally nothing other than exploring one's views). [Wrong view leads to wrong intention... which leads to wrong knowledge, which leads to wrong liberation.](https://suttacentral.net/an10.105/en/sujato?lang=en)

    Fundamentally, you could say that whatever is an arisen thing, no matter how subtle or ambiguous, is part of your body, whereas your attitudes, views, actions and assumptions in regard to arisen things is where the mind is (citta), and that's why it's always "indirect". You can't "see" your mind in the way of "me here looking at that" in which you perceive even your thoughts. Thus, it's extremely wrong to say that the mind is in the brain, as the brain is a material thing which has its own way of functioning/manifesting, and your mind has attitudes in regard to your body, which includes your brain. This is how an Arahant can get neurological disorders: whatever happens in the brain is what you liberate yourself *from*. Thus, the idea that measurable changes in the brain due to "meditation" are what development of *mind* is is as ignorant as it gets, and that's why that type of meditation—well, even the traditional Buddhist type too in the end, inadvertently—revolves around making your life better, not about abandoning attachment to life.

    
    >I tend to think that if Ajahn Nyanamoli puts it in those specific terms of "body" and "sense organs" and not of "mind" that's for a good reason, but I would like opinions from people more expert than me on the subject

    Yes, and one also must remember that there are two "minds": citta and mano. Mano is a sense base and is thus part of the body/brain and [belongs to Māra](https://suttacentral.net/sn4.19/en/bodhi?lang=en&reference=none&highlight=false), whereas citta is that which gets liberated from Māra.

    >because when I give the example of not giving up when doing physical exercises and that it gets difficult and physical pain arises, this is the mind not giving up by discerning the body as an individual entity going through a painful process, not the mind not giving up by discerning the mind feeling a painful process, right? I'm lost

    You could say either, but with the latter you would need to say that the first mind is citta while the second is mano, i.e. part of the body still (though way subtler, of course).

### what is distraction and delusion?

HH always talk about Greed Aversion and distraction/delusion. And also talk against practice of focusing on one meditation object.

So If there is no predefined meditation object. how to discern distraction?. Distraction from what ?

and similarly how to discern delusion.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

    >So If there is no predefined meditation object. how to discern distraction?. Distraction from what ?

    There is no predefined "object" in the sense that narrowing down the scope of your attention *is* a form of delusion already, meaning that that's not (right) meditation.

    "Distraction" has in itself nothing to do with the movement of your thoughts towards this or that. True distraction is when your thoughts move towards this or that ***and*** you lose the fundamental context behind those things you are attending to, being that they're impermanent, suffering and not worth appropriating. Otherwise, an Arahant would have to have some sort of perpetually constricted awareness so as to not be deluded/distracted, and constricting your awareness *even more* within the artificial environment that "sitting meditation" usually entails for people can't possibly train your mind to be free from distraction in every possible situation. Rather, it misconceives a *particular kind of situation* (of a focused mind that has limited perceptions) as non-distraction, meaning your mind is distracted/deluded in regard to *that* simply due to taking that "meditative state" for granted.

    So you abandon distraction/delusion by questioning your attitude behind whatever experience is already there, not by trying to have non-distraction as an *positive experience* in itself, which is impossible. The wholesome states are always "negatives".

### Has anyone in HH read Bhikkhu Bodhi's answer to Nanavira Thera's "A note on Paticcasamuppad" ?

I don't have the skill required to assess the validity of this answer or to critique it but if someone already has I'd be happy to read it !

The answer of Bhikkhu Bodhi is here starting at page 40 and mostly takes aim at the one life DO understanding of Nanavira Thera :

[https://www.bps.lk/olib/bp/bp437s\_Bodhi\_Investigating-Dhamma.pdf](https://www.bps.lk/olib/bp/bp437s_Bodhi_Investigating-Dhamma.pdf)

Edit : Going down this rabbit hole I also found Bhikkhu Analayo's article on Nanavira here : 

[https://www.academia.edu/87275746/Clearing\_the\_Path\_Continues\_Notes\_on\_%C3%91%C4%81%E1%B9%87av%C4%ABra\_Thera\_s\_Notes\_on\_Dhamma](https://www.academia.edu/87275746/Clearing_the_Path_Continues_Notes_on_%C3%91%C4%81%E1%B9%87av%C4%ABra_Thera_s_Notes_on_Dhamma)

And an excellent thread commenting on Bhikkhu Analayo's article here : 

[https://www.dhammawheel.com/viewtopic.php?t=43925](https://www.dhammawheel.com/viewtopic.php?t=43925)

&#x200B;

I post this only because I think it could be useful material if one feels the need to understand why some of the buddhist orthodoxy might take aim at HH's understanding of Dhamma.

&#x200B;

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/185dv2f/has_anyone_in_hh_read_bhikkhu_bodhis_answer_to/kb6x7wb/)** _2023-11-29 00:07:04_:

    Apart from having failed at grasping the actual context of the argument and addressing only superficial points instead, Bhikkhu Bodhi (and critics in general) don't realize that the paṭiccasamuppāda "interpretation" of Ñāṇavīra actually includes the phenomenon of "rebirth" (a word that does not exist in Pali and usually carries wrong connotations) in a *simpler* manner, without needing to introduce alien notions that are nowhere found in the Suttas, and are inevitably there when you think in terms of a three life interpretation. 

    One of the main problems with that is the fact that the idea of anattā then becomes contradictory, as the "progression" of the paṭiccasamuppāda factors it's effectively implying that thee is *some* sort of phenomenon that goes from one life to the next, while at the same time saying the fact that there is "no lasting entity" is what anattā is (which isn't the case). They then have to resort to this simile of the candle to say that "the first candle lights up the next one, but the fire us not the same", failing to see that there *is* still something being "transferred" there (literally, even in physics you can't create energy, so the energy of the first candle is what moves on to the next). In essence, it's implicitly *positing* an idea of self and then proceeding to deny it because that obviously contradicts the letter of the Buddha's teaching.

    Ñāṇavīra's interpretation, on the other hand, is so general and phenomenologically acute that you don't even need to go to the end of the sequence to "explain" how this life is not the last. Every single pair of factors is already in itself showing the principle of "rebirth" in a way that also simultaneously prevents even the suggestion of a self, while also not denying the obvious fact that there *is* some enduring identity.

    (See Ñāṇavīra's note on ATTĀ explaining how the self-identity of things has nothing to do with anattā).

    Edit: Also, I should add that the polar opposite of the three life interpretation, which is that it's all just a "process" happening here and now as experience unfolds, a la Thanissaro Bhikkhu, is equally wrong because it still involves time, just in a much shorter scale. As well, the connection to the endless wandering in saṃsāra is tenuous, as there is no inherent reason why the process should "start again", if you have supposedly stopped it by practicing meditation momentarily as a puthujjana, which is a common misconception that terribly waters down paṭiccasamuppāda.

    Ñāṇavīra's interpretation is the Middle Way between these two misguided extremes.

### Not acting out of the pressure

Hello, I will probably come off as a lunatic but I'm tempted to ask this question anyway to advance in my practice and clear the path, it should be known that my mind as a tendancy to overthink a good bit.

&#x200B;

The next four paragraphs are just to set the context but are probably not necessary for my issue if you want to skip them:

Lately I've been starting to read Ajahn Nyanamoli's *The Only way to Jhana* and to train for the gradual training. I'm at the second stage, doing sense-restraint, though I'm not sure of the criterion to know that I'm "seeing danger in the slightest fault" and therefore to know if I'm qualified to go to this next step. I just tend to summarize that danger by the fact that :

'It leads to hurting myself, hurting others, and hurting both. It blocks wisdom, it’s on the side of anguish, and it doesn’t lead to extinguishment.' ([MN 19](https://suttacentral.net/mn19/en/sujato))

So I'm trying to detect when I feel the pressure of wanting to get or feel something pleasant; or of wanting to get rid of an unpleasant phenomenon; or to do something that's not urgent or only in order to distract myself with non dhamma related subjects.

I also read the eighth essay "The pleasure of boredom" and so I thought the stage of sense restraint was quite compatible with the training of doing nothing, letting the mind wander around, allowing thoughts to come up and letting them endure without trying to get rid of them or cast them aside (as I reflexively often do) even when they are leading to unpleasant sensations, seeing them for what they are, sometimes as unpleasant phenomena that I don't really want.

&#x200B;

So let's say one caused harm or bothered someone without even noticing it and without any bad intentions and during one's sense-restraint training the person to whom one have caused harm retaliates in one way or another by indirect means, and the thought came up to one to dissipate any unexpressed and unneeded tensions by clearing things up with the person instead of doing nothing.

&#x200B;

What I'm questionning about is: in the context of sense-restraint and not acting out of pressure of the senses, since the need to act come from pressure from the mind, should one still act to dissipate the possible tensions/grudges or should one let those thoughts (thoughts that there might be grudges and to dissipate the grudges) endure until they eventually pass away, without taking action in order to cultivate dispassion towards these mind-phenomena even if it mean not diffusing a grudge?

All that in order to eventually not even be moved by the possible repercussions of such grudge anymore? Grudges not being my responsability (not being in my control as opposed to how I react to such repercussions) even though I could try to act to lessen them.

&#x200B;

In the end, should the aim of one rather be to cultivate dispassion towards these unpleasant thoughts all together, to eventually attain extinguishment, or should one rather cultivate good-will and harmlessness towards others even if it means acting out of unpleasant thoughts and feelings you decided to not act out of in the first place?

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/183fm82/not_acting_out_of_the_pressure/kapitmy/)** _2023-11-25 15:54:14_:

    >All this could sound silly or over the top but it bring the question: should one cultivate dispassion towards these unpleasant thoughts, to eventually attain extinction, or should one rather cultivate good-will and harmlessness towards others even if it means acting out of thoughts you decided to not act out of in the first place?

    The problem here is that before having the Right View, one cannot even fully fathom what "cultivating dispassion" actually means, because one does not see what *passion* is to begin with (2nd Noble Truth) on the right level and with clarity.

    So yes, one should cultivate dispassion in every situation, but if you try to go all-in with that now, you will end up mechanically trying to just "deal" with individual thoughts and the way they make you feel, rather than *your craving and defilements* in regard to how they make you feel, because the signs of the mind have not been sufficiently discerned, [meaning that abandoning defilements is not possible](https://suttacentral.net/SN47.8/en/sujato). All one can do without seeing those signs is *suppress* the craving and—whether one is aware of it and thinks of it like that or not—that's not the practicė˙. So first you need to never forget that you still don't see what dispassion is, because of which will feel like at some point it's too much (which is not the case for actual dispassion on the "right level").

    Moreover, true good-will and harmlessness are only possible from a dispassionate perspective, so it would be wrong to think that trying to develop dispassion is somehow "different" to developing mettā. If your dispassion is not resulting in complete lack of aversion, which is what mettā is, not "loving kindness", then it's not pure dispassion; it's tainted with aversion and cynicism.

    In this case, going out and trying to amend worldly circumstances to make people feel better has nothing to do with mettā. Mettā is about not resisting, not trying to get rid of the discomfort that *you are feeling* on account of other beings. That should be your only goal, and then, when the mind is fully established in the theme of non-aversion towards all upsetting cirucumstances you may possibly experience, *whatever* you do, even if it's nothing, will be rooted in kindness. But if you try to reach the kindness through doing the external actions *first*, that's putting the cart before the horse.

    Also, keep in mind that you can't possibly be analyzing which "stage' you're at, how long until the next one, etc. (and all that generally sounds like an overly achievement-oritented mindset that will lead to turning the Dhamma into something excessively clear-cur and methodical). The training is about sticking to the things that will over time make the signs of the mind become apparent on their own. That's not something you can have a direct say in. The most direct influence you have over your "progress" is whether you allow yourself to engage with things that you know are rooted in craving. 

    If you *never* do that, then you can be sure that however slowly or quickly the practice may be unfolding, this is the highest "speed" that is possible.

### Formal Practice to help in day to day life

 How can a beginner incorporate a formal practice that will help in enduring the intense pressure arising during the day to day life while acting according to “ seeing danger in the slightest fault”? Could endurance during formal sit in a controlled environment help in endurance during day to day life? Any practical advices? 

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/182ss21/formal_practice_to_help_in_day_to_day_life/kamlqvq/)** _2023-11-24 23:21:41_:

    To add to what u/bodily_heartfulness wrote:

    The very act of considering to take up a "formal practice" is already something you would not be "seeing the danger in the slightest fault" in regard to if you just take that idea at face value and go with it, assuming that it can't possibly be unwholesome (because it's about practice, right?).

    That serves to illustrate the gratuitous divide between "formal" and "everday" practice which causes you to  exclude certain choices from your attempts to flush out greed, aversion and delusion. On the basis of that, you may well be able to abandon almost all coarse, *external* acts rooted in unwholesome intentions, which very dedicated technique-meditators are often able to do, but the entire thing for them would still be underlied by their attitudes towards the "formal practice" which they exempted from investigation and careful "observation" in the same way they spend their time observing irrelevant *sense objects*.

    Thinking about the ways in which you're still acting out by body and speech in unwholesome ways and then reflecting on *why* such actions should be avoided , not just taking it as a sense of duty, until you feel no desire to commit those actions anymore is a practice everyone should be doing. It will be abstract in the beginning and you will probably just be giving overly rationalized reasons without actually seeing the danger of defilement within yourself, but over time , especially if you make the effort to restrain the actions anyway, you get to see the "right level" where contemplation should apply and where it ceases to be abstract. That means it begins to work every single time  at purifying the mind, to the point where all you'd need to do to put defilements to rest is think/remember (sati), regardless of what you're occupied with (unless it's unwholesome, of course).

### Reflection on a daily basis

Throughout the day I try to reflect on my thoughts as per the dhamma that I 'am learning from ven Bhikkhu Anigha, ven Thaniyo Thero and ven Ajahn Nyanamoli. How I 'am trying to reflect is the beginning, endurance and the end (without thinking or going into details of the thought). But there are so many thoughts that arises, and I get distracted to which one I should reflect on. Then I tried the main / strong thoughts that arises out of sensuality and anger etc. Is this the correct way?

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/181btzn/reflection_on_a_daily_basis/kadgbyk/)** _2023-11-23 00:12:44_:

    Don't approach this through the usual attitude of trying to "observe" things that is present in almost all forms of contemporary meditation. That would ensure that whatever you are discerning is irrelevant to the Four Noble Truths.

    When the Suttas talk about "arising, enduring and ending" that's not to be understood as a linear process that you can, as an uninvolved witness, watch as you would a projectile being launched into the air and falling. The reason for that is simple: if the thought has truly *ended*, you would not be able to recognize that it has ended. In order to say *anything* about a thought, including the fact that it has supposedly disappeared, you need to be thinking it still, which means it's still there.

    In the case of the arising, it's impossible for you to say "when" the thought arose, because time itself is measured by the endurance of whatever you're thinking, meaning that there is no way for you to conceive of a time when a particular thought was not there at least as a possibility. Even if you look at the past, you will be doing so through the thoughts that you have right now, meaning that those thoughts will now be the way in which you experience those memories, regardless of the fact that those thoughts "arose" later from an external, objective, and irrelevant scientific viewpoint.

    It's important to abandon the view that thoughts are "in my head", which is what would incline one towards these gratuitous misapplications of science to the domain of the mind and consciousness. Rather, "thoughts" are phenomena in the most general sense, including the perceptions of your five senses that you may not be engaging in a narrative about. So even if you supposedly shut up your thinking and just have pure perceptions, *you're still thinking* (this is why the view that meditation is meant to stop or even diminish your thinking is so ridiculously wrong: it's rooted in the ignorance of the extent of what a thought/vitakkavicāra really is, meaning that the __whole__ "jhāna sequence" that those "meditators" are going through is actually not even the first jhāna―which is the comprehension of the full extent of thinking as it happens―no matter how special and blissful it may all feel).

    Instead, recognize that whatever "thought" is there right now, you are totally enclosed within and you have no way of knowing when it started or when it will end. As well, you need to take it on the most general sense, on the level of what thought is currently pressuring you and being felt the most. So when you're sitting there "watching" these thoughts supposedly coming and going without your involvement, there is actually a thought behind *all of that* that is not being recognized, a thought of "I want to be doing this practice" for example, and that is being ignored. Such thoughts are also there the entire time when people are supposedly not thinking and focusing on an object instead.

    The "arising" of that more general thought that truly matters and where your craving and actions are cannot possibly be something you pinpoint, because as soon as you start "observing it" like that, it won't be the more general thought anymore, and *another one* will be behind it, whose arising you now overlooked, and so on ad infinitum. 

    But to actually get to see this correctly, I would advise not even trying to think in terms of thoughts in general for now, and instead use things like the recollection of the body to "outline" the nature of thoughts. Instead of going "into" the thoughts to investigate them and start categorizing them and measuring them, use the recognition of the body as a peripheral anchor to see that *whatever* you may be thinking about, with no regard whatsoever for its *content*, is still a thought, defining "thought" as any phenomenon, internal or external, light or heavy, inferior or superior, coarse or subtle, clear or ambiguous that is secondary to this body, and that changes in various ways while the body remains mostly the same.

    Pair this with what I wrote above that it's the thoughts were the craving and pressure are that matter, and thus it's not about observing every little secondary perception that comes up about this or that like the sound of the birds or the memories of what you were doing yesterday (unless those memories start exerting emotional pressure). That's why it's always about recognizing the "intentions behind one's actions", meaning you start to see those peripheral thoughts that you're welcoming and taking for granted, and start to include *that* as well as secondary to the body and remove the perversion of the right order. Without that (which means seeing the signs of the mind), you will just be seeing that random, irrelevant perceptions that have nothing to do with craving are secondary to the body.

    Edit: Regarding how contemporary meditators are not actually even in the first jhāna, that's what I meant with [this](https://reddit.com/comments/17owo0t/comment/k82c6qd) comment which some people seem to have misunderstood. It's not that the *content* of the experience is not changing (and because content is what our intentions influence, that content can very well become just what you expect based on what you know about jhānas). It's the fact that that background level of the *domain* of thinking and pondering has not been transcended at any point, *because*, ironically, of the starting point of wanting to suppress the thinking.

### Being mindful with the breath

Sorry that's a repost, the first one wasn't as accurate as I thought.

&#x200B;

Hello, I was listening to the HH video titled "Why did the Buddha say "Sensuality" to be an Assumption?" and at one point ([https://youtu.be/WNotZXYWV-0?si=avxKzNf3snKgh5j-&t=2895](https://youtu.be/WNotZXYWV-0?si=avxKzNf3snKgh5j-&t=2895)) Ajahn Nyanamoli mentionned that the first time he read a text about an arahant named  Anuruddha on whom a woman had tried to force her charms by getting naked, dancing and trying to sleep with him, and he stated that at first he didn't understand why it was written that an arahant became mindful of his breath, but finally came to understand that the arahant though unperturbed by the acts of the lady was aware of the significance and that it was harassing.

So I was wondering, what does "being mindful of the breath" mean in the suttas?

From what I think I understood from Ajahn Nyanamoli teachings, he doesn't think it is recommended to do breathing exercises or to force the breath and think at the same time "I"m breathing in, I'm breathing out". If I'm not mistaken he rather talks about it as something to be kept peripherally, so I don't think here "being mindful of the breath" is specifically related only to the breath, so what could be meant here? Being aware of the phenomenon arising within the 5 aggregates maybe?

&#x200B;

    >From what I think I understood from Ajahn Nyanamoli teachings, he doesn't think it is recommended to do breathing exercises or to force the breath and think at the same time "I"m breathing in, I'm breathing out".

    Yes, Anapanasati is not about breathing exercises or about the *perceptions* of breathing, because that has nothing to do with cultivating dispassion towards the five aggregates (the only true measure of progress). Watching one's breath and mechanical mental exercises may give rise to some insights, but those insights do not pertain to what actually disturbs the mind, meaning greed, aversion and delusion. Instead, one just hopes that going through these motions and getting these "experiences" will magically clear out the defilements, which means not only does one not know what the defilements are, but one is also not trying to find out, or is assuming them to be some trivial things that are addressed to any extent simply by sticking to this formulaic practice.

    What such practices reveal is always on the level of *perceptions*: you will hear teachers describing the "flashes of sankharas", "flow of particles" or "discontinuous stream of consciousness", or "insubstatiality/emptiness of *objects*" that one is supposed to see at the end of one's breath-observation efforts (or any similar object-centered practices not found in the Suttas). Those insights are then *inferred* to be the discernment of the Four Noble Truths through some tenuous connection, if any.

    In the best case scenario of teachers who try to be loyal to the Suttas at least superficially, you will hear them saying that craving is the problem, but they will tend to explain it in terms of a "tightening up" of your body that happens when you are not properly aware of the breath, or any more elaborate ways of saying that if you just attend to this or that *sense object* (which includes random mental phenomena gratuitously regarded to *be* insight, such as experiential perceptions of flux) your problems will be solved.

    Now onto the story you mention about Ven. Anuruddha:

    It actually doesn't say anything about him practicing anapanasati, so Ajahn Nyanamoli mixed it up with some other Sutta or simply remembered it wrongly. The actual passage in Pali only says "indriyāni okkhipitvā taṁ itthiṁ neva okolesi napi alāpi" meaning "having put down his faculties (which does not mean he cowardly "buried his head in the sand"), he neither looked at that woman nor spoke to her".

    However, the fact that AN mistakenly inserted that into the story actually goes to show what anapanasati should be about and what its actual purpose is.

    >So I was wondering, what does "being mindful of the breath" mean in the suttas?

    Not to nitpick on your question specifically, but it does in itself point towards the answer: the Suttas never talk about "being mindful ***of the breath***". That's the false premise that people often don't even realize they're starting from. This is what the Suttas say:

    >so satova assasati, satova passasati. dīghaṃ vā assasanto ‘dīghaṃ assasāmī’ti ***pajānāti***, dīghaṃ vā passasanto ‘dīghaṃ passasāmī’ti ***pajānāti***...

    >Remembering, he breathes in; remembering, he breathes out. Or, breathing in long, he ***understands*** "I am breathing in long", or, breathing out long, he ***understands*** "I am breathing out long"..

    —MN 118

    (pajānāti is the verb form of paññā, understanding/discernment)

    To most this will sound like a distinction without a difference, but it's absolutely crucial. If the Buddha wanted to convey the idea that the breath as an __object__ is what the practice revolves around, he would have said something more like "dīghaṁ assāsaṁ __paṭisaṁvedeti/manasi karoti__", meaning "he experiences/attends to __an inhalation__." or something along those lines which points to some benefit in observing perceptions and sensations per se instead of *understanding*.

    What the Buddha is saying here is that one must understand the act of "[I am] breathing in long", and "understanding", even in mundane terms, is not about the object or perception that you attend to directly. It's always about knowing the *nature* of that thing in an indirect manner (really, reflect on that for a moment). If you're a mechanic, your understanding of cars is not determined by some specific *object*, but by having a whole bunch of meanings and peripheral significances that your mind naturally remembers and serve as an implicit background to whenever you look at a car.

    In this case, that "peripheral" understanding of the body and its breathing (kayasankhara) automatically brings dispassion towards anything that pertains to that body, most especially the six sense base. It has nothing to do with stopping or suppressing the six sense base in favor of breathing sensations.

    
    True anapanasati leads one first and foremost to overcome the default identification with the pull of the six senses, so that no matter how hard they pull towards this or that, the mind [remains established and anchored](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.247/en/bodhi) in the *simultaneous foundation* for that sense domain in its entirety. The entire world of pleasing and displeasing sense objects exists "on top of" the breathing body, hence Ajahn Nyanamoli wrote that one must be recognizing the breath "underneath" one's experience in the "How to Calm Your Mind" Chapter in Dhamma Within Reach.

    
    So, when the situation with that woman happened to Ven. Anuruddha, the mind would be able to "withdraw the faculties" not by becoming oblivious to what is happening and shutting it out forcefully (already rooted in the wrong view that you are the master of your experiences and feelings), but by becoming anchored in that peripheral recognition of what determines his senses (because even if he were to close his eyes and cover his ears, that wouldn't make a difference; the six wild animals already know exactly what's going on), and that would make him dispassionate towards the entire thing, not feeling any sort of internal agitation while the full force of that significance of offered pleasure is still there, attacking *the same body that is also breathing and is being discerned through that.*

    Thus, what anapanasati―if it is to be a "Buddhist" practice in the first place like everything else found in the Suttas―has to lead to is this:

    >“Bhante, when a bhikkhu is thus perfectly liberated in mind, even if powerful forms cognizable by the eye come into range of the eye, they do not obsess his mind; his mind is not at all affected. It remains steady, attained to imperturbability, and he recognizes their liabaility to decay. Even if powerful sounds cognizable by the ear come into range of the ear … Even if powerful odors cognizable by the nose come into range of the nose … Even if powerful tastes cognizable by the tongue come into range of the tongue … Even if powerful tactile objects cognizable by the body come into range of the body … Even if powerful phenomena cognizable by the mind come into range of the mind, they do not obsess his mind; his mind is not at all affected. It remains steady, attained to imperturbability, and he recognizes their liability to decay.

    ―AN 6.55

    And ***not***:

    >"Bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu is thus perfectly concentrated on the breath, there are no forms cognizable by the eye. The sensations of breathing and bodily pleasure are what obsess his mind, so there is no chance for anything else to arise and disturb him."

    The former is unshakable samādhi, the latter is pleasant oblivion and ***loss*** of awareness (AKA "absorption").

    Last but certainly not least, it must be noted that anapanasati, as any other form of Right Recollection, requires the Right View to be done properly (APS is called "the abiding of a Noble One" in SN 54.11 and taught to an ariya-only Sangha in MN 118) and most certainly it requires not *acting* out of the pulls of the six senses towards sensuality and ill-will, which will inherently mean that you will not be able to recognize that which is "underneath" them. Every time you act unskilfully with the body you are already overlooking its sankhara by a longshot, and are involved with the sankharas of desires, which are way coarser.

    Edit: By *learning* what Anapanasati truly is, one is learning what the Right View is by extension, and it is only from that lens that one should approach it. Not as something that one is *already* practicing rightly.

### How to live virtue according to the Dhamma

Could you recommend a text, book, or transcript by HH that provides a more detailed and practice-oriented explanation of the first step of gradual training, virtues, sense restriction, and endurance? 

Could it be useful to read the Vinaya? 

&#x200B;

    >provides a more detailed and practice-oriented explanation of the first step of gradual training, virtues, sense restriction, and endurance? 

    >Could it be useful to read the Vinaya? 

    If my sense of what you're asking is correct (especially with your mention of the Vinaya), you will not find "detailed" explanations of the practice of virtue in HH teachings.

    That's because that's exactly what one needs to avoid in order to truly become "accomplished in virtue". If your virtue and restraint depends on adhering to any more specific instructions than that of not breaking the 8 precepts, it will still be a form of adhering to virtue and duty.

    The "accomplishment in virtue" that the Suttas refer to as a prerequisite for samādhi and as that which characterizes the stream-enterer is *defined* by the fact that one has learned what is wholesome and what is unwholesome on the basis of one's mental state, not on the basis of specific guidelines. Even the Vinaya is its current legalistic and highly detailed form is actually not supposed to exist ideally. It exists only because monks over time started losing perspective, and people of increasingly lowly character began to join the Sangha. In the beginning, "don't do anything unwholesome" would've been enough for monks to keep perfect virtue, because they had the criteria of their mental state as the determining factor which, without even thinking about it, made them incapable of breaking the still-unexistent rules that were actually addressing unwholesome actions and not just cultural expectations and circumstances.

    So, if you're still keeping the 5 precepts only then the more "detailed" practice would be to work towards keeping the 8, gradually if you must. As part of that effort, you would also need to work on abandoning doubt on a mental level, the other of the first 3 fetters, that will often arise when your mind feels that the precepts are somehow "not enough" and wants to over-clarify what unwholesome is, in the way the Vinaya does in its commentary (which did not come from the Buddha) under each rule.

    The whole point of that "noble aggregate of virtue" that a sotāpanna has is that they're not *doing it*. They need absolutely no "details" anymore in order to keep their virtue unbroken, not because they memorized the entire Vinaya and commentaries and sub-commentaries, but because they thoroughly discerned what is the criterion for wholesome and unwholesome *internally*. And that is something that will stay with you even after you die, whereas the intellectual "details" that you learned will be gone even in this life if you get some neurological disease, meaning the core of your practice of "virtue" would go with it (which is the case for many monks, unfortunately).

### The arahant and his baby

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

During minute 7:35 Ajahn Nyanamoli talked about a sutta where a mother bring her baby to her ex husband who's an arahant. He said the arahant didn't even look at the baby until the mother realized "He would leave this baby to die" and take the baby home.

&#x200B;

I wanna know which sutta this is. And also I'm wondering, Ajahn talk about how the Buddha said "it's how every arahant should behave" but isn't it neglecting the baby? What if the mother didn't come back? The baby would really die.

&#x200B;

What is the difference in taking care of a baby and dogs?

&#x200B;

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvQRbVs3oIY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvqrbvs3oiy)

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/17ys4pb/the_arahant_and_his_baby/k9vwj36/)** _2023-11-19 13:13:19_:

    >And also I'm wondering, Ajahn talk about how the Buddha said "it's how every arahant should behave" 

    Yes, he uttered a verse in praised of that monk.

    >but isn't it neglecting the baby? What if the mother didn't come back? The baby would really die.

    He probably knew that she was going to come back, but either way he wouldn't have been emotionally bound to the baby.

    It's not that he would have been *unaware* of the significance and the feelings of "this is my son", and register only "bare perceptions" of a lump of flesh like a robot, but that his mind would always instinctively recognize that as a [lovely but poisonous drink](https://suttacentral.net/SN12.66/en/sujato). Thus, it would be impossible for him to even *mentally* act out of that arisen significance in the [murderous five aggregates](https://suttacentral.net/sn22.85/en/sujato) and "love" the baby, due to always fully [withstanding and remaining unmoved by the force](https://suttacentral.net/SN35.228/en/sujato) of any significance that comes up. By extension, it would be even more impossible for him to act out of it bodily or verbally and start playing with the baby and so on, happily chugging down that tasty venom and letting the 5 amicable murderers inside his home.

    But, in the unlikely event that the mother didn't come back, and if the significance of "he will die" became strong enough, which it wasn't at that moment, he would go through the hassle of doing something to prevent it from dying, and finding someone else who can take care of the child as soon as possible, without ever swallowing the poisonous drink being offered to him internally at any point.

    
    >What is the difference in taking care of a baby and dogs?

    Dogs can't talk. That's a huge one.

    They also don't need to be raised, and your behavior has only a limited influence on their internal development. They won't start doing drugs or killing people if you neglect them. They are  easy to feed and can pretty much take care of themselves for the most part, and don't need an education. You can even neuter them and make them even easier to take care of while also greatly diminishing their suffering.

    Besides, they die pretty soon, so you have to be foolish and shortsighted to allow yourself to become attached to them too much.

    In comparison, the hassle of raising a child is so large that it *requires* the perversion of perception of suffering as happiness in order to willingly take it on.

    Also, as a human, if you have a person who is asleep with you, your mind will not feel truly alone. But you can be with a dozen dogs and you would still be able to feel internally secluded if you're not attached to them. That's just how the aggregates work.

    But of course, if you become attached to the dogs, or to anything, then you're still ingesting poison that tastes good, and will pay the price eventually.

    Edit: And, the point of the video is that mettā is not "loving kindness". True mettā would be the fact that he would prevent the baby from dying if the mother truly never came back, without "loving" it at all, and that mettā would apply to that baby exactly to the same extent as any other being, without a bias.

    In contrast, the modern idea of mettā as "loving kindness" has you picture a person who is skilled in it *loving a baby that's not even theirs*, and even expanding that attitude towards all beings. As in, going out of your way to ingest the noxious cocktails of others.

    The problem is evidenced by how they would be horrified if the being they're spreading "loving kindness" towards were to be killed next moment, and *get angry* at whoever did it, proving that there's a bias. But if it's true mettā, whether it's towards humans or animals, you wouldn't be disturbed and angry with anyone if that happened. Hence, it's a form of complete non-attachment that actually brings you closer to Arahantship instead of away from it.

### Where to Visit/Ordain

This question has been asked before but with the growth of this community, I think it may be worth asking again, especially with the addition of Bhante u/Bhikkhu_Anigha

I believe an appropriate monastic environment would have the following:

1) Plenty of time for seclusion/study/contemplation and away from the city
2) Strong adherence to and training in the vinaya
3) Meditation instruction that is either absent, optional, open-ended, or not strict
4) (for foreigners) A visa situation that is not overly burdensome
5) (optional) Internet access

I am interested in monasteries that fulfil the above criteria. I am curious if there is a decent way to vet monasteries for these qualities (esp 1-3) relatively quickly. Maybe some general qualities to look out for. For example, I have heard Dhammayut monasteries are generally strict about vinaya.

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/17y7q8o/where_to_visitordain/k9tuuot/)** _2023-11-19 00:22:24_:

    I'll give advice from the perspective of someone who's only lived in Sri Lanka so far:

    Here you should be able to find places that meet at least the first 4 criteria (not sure what you meant with the 5th. They usually wouldn't confiscate your phone unlike Thai places, if that's what you're referring to, unless it's a "Meditation Center"; more on that below).

    

    The visa situation is generally better than in Thailand, since it is at least possible to get more than a one year visa in special cases if you're already a monk.

    There's also not much of a strong emphasis on "teachers", and they tend to be a lot more relaxed than in Thailand, as far as I've heard about how it is there. That applies even more for foreigners, who would hardly ever be "forced" to do things, and would generally be able to avoid most of the unnecessary duties and distractions the local monks happily engage in (which is still less than in Thailand; I've seen monks there meticulously polishing *floors* with handkerchiefs, let alone the large Buddha statues. That former would never happen here; the latter only every once in a while at most). And there's only a few monasteries, usually more in the "Meditation Center" style, that have teachers of the "Guru" type, in the sense of an infallible spiritual leader. I ordained in one of those places and they confiscated my phone/SIM Card (though I got it back eventually) and even there it was possible to not participate in most of the unnecessary fluff like group meditation without repercussion long enough to get my higher ordination, after which pressure to conform started to increase.

    I don't think you would even be getting "Meditation Instructions" in the majority of places here, or at least they wouldn't be enforced, more so as a foreigner.

    For strict Vinaya you would have to look here for the "Galduwa" forest monasteries, the sect that is roughly equivalent to the Dhammayut (and in some areas not so similar, which can be good). "We" keep strict Vinaya―monks who use money are for instance not allowed in the Patimokkha―although it's mostly based on the Commentaries and can sometimes be pedantic and clearly made up. But it's not too bad and a downright heretic like myself has been able to go along just fine, not trying to defend "the right way" of Vinaya free of Commentarial influences that would equally be just as much of a rite/ritual, and even more so because then you're *going out of your way* to make sure it's followed.

    [This pdf](https://www.bps.lk/olib/mi/mi008.pdf) was useful when I was starting out, although there's probably a lot of outdated information. By the time I got here it was already not entirely accurate, not to mention now.

### Yoniso Manasikara

I have doubts that I understand Yoniso Manasikara correctly.

I attended a talk about Yoniso Manasikara at the Samanadipa monastery. Bhante Phasuko gave an example of how one should try to see their own face and, in a way, see behind one's experience. Just like how you can't see your eye, but you know it's there because of its absence. The moment I turned around and tried to look at myself, I discovered this hollow, empty place devoid of any possibility of ownership void. It felt as if might as well be dead, as far as it looks like.
Another example was given that if you put pressure on your finger to cause yourself a bit of pain and establish yourself in that order, you would not suffer.
So that place is where suffering can't follow.

After the unavoidable existential dread and full-on anxieties of meeting with the void and the literal uprooting of my assumed external sense-based ownership independent from the body, some time passed and I found myself again taking automatic ownership in the experience and hence suffering. Since then, I have been experimenting and trying to always have that establishment, but suffering still persists. It felt like I was managing my suffering with this kind of establishment and avoiding the responsibility of the pressure. And ironically, the greatest fruit of the practice!

This is why I was so thankful that Bhante Anigha took the time and explained to me about what samadhi really is and how to endure the pressure, and that pressure is actually rewarding you by enduring it correctly. I can't say that I have a good understanding of this because I am still missing the correct understanding of Yoniso Manasikara and how it all fits into the puzzle.

Another thing that confuses me is that I have heard Ajahn Nyanamoli speak about it, and what I understand from him is that Yoniso Manasikara is the context of whatever is happening in front of you, hence the diminishing of unwholesomeness because of that higher perspective.

But I have seen Bhante Anigha making a clear distinction between Yoniso Manasikara and the context. The context, to me, seems like it needs to develop from the painful lessons, and then if pondered sufficiently, it endures in the background, which should be Yoniso Manasikara.

Or is it just the ability, for example, to recollect the body posture, and that space is already Yoniso Manasikara?

So now, my practice was simply asking myself, "Do you want this?" while that image in my head endures. And it works - my mind initially touches it, but then it goes back like it has been burned as soon as the significance of the situation becomes apparent. It feels like the mind becomes dispassionate and doesn't want anything to do with that image. So experientially, it would be like things still appearing to you as the lack of something, and your senses reacting, but they pass right through you, and you're still at peace somehow. Not only that, but because of those pressures, you get more peace. Who would have guessed that such an absurd principle of chitta? This also helped me see exactly where that line is between the reactions of the animals and the mind's craving aspect. As soon as I see that the mind is latching onto something, I ask again, "Do you want this?"

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/17xn8mp/yoniso_manasikara/k9qrjgu/)** _2023-11-18 08:00:33_:

    > Since then, I have been experimenting and trying to always have that establishment, but suffering still persists. It felt like I was managing my suffering with this kind of establishment and avoiding the responsibility of the pressure. 

    Yes, this is why it's always essential to remain self-honest, and to tell yourself that no matter how much you feel like you understood things, there ***has to be*** some way in which you're not even fully self-transparent yet unless you have the Right View. In fact, no matter what happens, even if you suddenly enter the fourth jhāna and get the triple knowledges and psychic powers one night, assume yourself to have made no progress whatsoever. That is the way to keep making *actual* progress.

    >Another thing that confuses me is that I have heard Ajahn Nyanamoli speak about it, and what I understand from him is that Yoniso Manasikara is the context of whatever is happening in front of you, hence the diminishing of unwholesomeness because of that higher perspective.

    Yes, that's what it is. "In front of you" also needs to be understood in a very general sense, as pretty much anything that you are aware of. Anything that is pressuring you.

    You could put it this way: instead of trying to *determine* "this much is that which is in front, and this much is that which is behind", which would leave your sense of self untouched, take *absolutely anything* that you find already there, arisen, including subtle things like restlessness, doubt, views, ideas, expectations, confusions, and and take that as your "in front". Then, your recognition of the *nature* of that whole experience is "the context". That's why that context ultimately doesn't have to be anything elaborate, it could just be a recognition that "I am thinking", *regardless* of what that thinking is about and the pressure it carries. That's how you would abandon doubt, for example, no matter how unpleasant it feels, and without trying to *stop* the thinking either.

    
    >But I have seen Bhante Anigha making a clear distinction between Yoniso Manasikara and the context. The context, to me, seems like it needs to develop from the painful lessons, and then if pondered sufficiently, ***it endures in the background, which should be Yoniso Manasikara.***

    >Or is it just the ability, for example, to recollect the body posture, and ***that space is*** already Yoniso Manasikara?

    It seems you partly misunderstood. I don't recall saying that yoniso manasikāra is a *result* of practicing the context (if you remember where it was I can clarify what the statement actually meant). 

    If anything it would be the other way around, yoniso manasikāra, which is what you need to be diligent with, is what would eventually make the context endure on its own without you needing to think about it.

    Regarding the phrase "that space is" that I highlighted above, I can't be 100% sure what you mean with that phrase but I will mention something just in case.

    It's better not to think of it as a "space" or something that you access or anything along those lines. That's because that will inevitably carry the implication that *you are doing it*, so to speak, and that's exactly why it's not actually the sufficient degree of yoniso manasikāra. That sort of attitude would turn even our descriptions of yoniso manasikāra into a "technique" that one would assume oneself, to one's misfortune, to already be doing rightly.

    Instead, again, as I wrote above, think of it as the practice towards overcoming your existence, and always tell yourself that there is a very large chance that you're not doing it correctly and that there is a part of your sense of self that is still "leaking out" of the container of the context, even if yoniso manasikāra "makes sense".

    It's about having an attitude of constant dissatisfaction with your practice, which is what gives rise to the right sense of urgency to develop it. If you do your best to be self-honest, it will always be obvious that the whole thing is still built on sand for the most part. And if you keep going like that, one day it will not be built on sand, but not because you were looking forward to that occasion. As the simile of the hen and the eggs in MN 16 goes, wishing distracts you from actually sitting on the eggs.

    Having said that, yes, recollecting your body posture on the right level, in the way that does not leave your sense of self out―i.e., when the inevitable thought of "I am entering this space" manages to gratuitously not be seen as within the context in one subtle way or another―is yoniso manasikāra. 

    >So now, my practice was simply asking myself, "Do you want this?" while that image in my head endures. And it works - my mind initially touches it, but then it goes back like it has been burned as soon as the significance of the situation becomes apparent. It feels like the mind becomes dispassionate and doesn't want anything to do with that image. So experientially, it would be like things still appearing to you as the lack of something, and your senses reacting, but they pass right through you, and you're still at peace somehow.

This also helped me see exactly where that line is between the reactions of the animals and the mind's craving aspect. As soon as I see that the mind is latching onto something, I ask again, "Do you want this?"

    Based solely on the verbatim description that could be along the right lines, but if *internally* it's right would depend. You would have to ask yourself to what extent asking yourself "do you want this?" is diminishing the pressure instead of adding a different significance to it.

    Also when you say "while that image in my head endures", I can't know for sure what you mean by that, but that could also mean taking the principle I referred to above of "yoniso manasikāra in regard to what's in front" too literally (a mistake which I initially made).

    If you want to ask yourself "do you want this?" on the right level, it would have to be something like your *entire experience and pressure* of being restless about something that's gonna happen tomorrow. You're not asking yourself whether you really want to go to that job interview after all, or something like that (that sort of coarse decision would be covered by sense restraint and virtue).

    In order to develop yoniso manasikāra, you need to be asking yourself whether you want to *welcome the possibility of trying to get rid of this situation of restlessness (in this example) in any way*, including looking at the particular images you are restless about and telling yourself they're not worth it. That would already be a form of acting out of restlessness, and would be the "wrong level".

    Going back to [this comment](https://reddit.com/comments/17v0cqw/comment/k9m9fpb) I wrote yesterday, sensuality is in fact the first hindrance also because if you understand what is the hindering aspect in it, you understand all the others too. 

    One has to be delusional to believe that one can volitionally stop perceiving the pleasure of an agreeable sense object, so by trying to overcome craving without denying that the pleasure is there, you force yourself to deal with the problem on the right level. That's why I wrote "you see ***this body*** as a charcoal pit", not "you bring up the pleasant image and tell yourself that ***that*** is a charcoal pit", which will force you to do the same thing again when the next image comes up.

    In the same way, whenever a pressure of any other kind is there, "do you want this?" should mean for you "do you want to try to wriggle out of what is already given―the "lack" of a pleasant object in this case which is itself a valid experience no matter how unpleasant it is―subjecting yourself to frustration on account of impermanence?", and ***not*** "how do I make what is already given, the "lack", not be there through asking this question?"

    In this way, you learn to be content and free from suffering in regard to torturous feelings, instead of evoking contentment so that torturous feelings don't arise, the "wrong level".

### Question about this HH video ???

At the 58 minute mark in this absolute gem of a Dhamma discussion they go really deep about not assuming an external self to your present experience. Upon repeated listens I think I’m starting to get it. But can someone give me a good example of a typical wrong assumption of an external self that I’m sure we all have the habit of doing. If I’m making any sense here?? lol

https://youtu.be/wZoIwMQHoc4?si=7ZCPesLcsIApAeL0

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/17xlmfp/question_about_this_hh_video/k9qmeo4/)** _2023-11-18 06:50:49_:

     > I think I’m starting to get it. 

    Maybe in theory if you hadn't before, but it's important to note that truly "getting it" has to result in the destruction of the first three fetters. 

    It is the general nature of every assumption that when you recognize it, it *cannot* come back. That's exactly why we call it assumption, whereas with "clinging" and similar, although it's technically not an inaccurate translation, the problem is it gives people the idea that as puthujjanas they can simply choose not to have upādāña for things and that they're basically in the same position as a sotapanna at that moment, and that assumption is catastrophic. You could talk about "clinging" and say that it's something that a puthujjana should avoid doing, but then you would have to be referring to something other than upādāna, which requires actual knowledge and vision to be removed and is not a matter of choice. And that "clinging" that they can avoid by choice, which could at times be beneficial as a form of Gradual Training, certainly wouldn't be on the level of the sense of self. It would only pertain to sense objects and coarse attachment towards opinions (which don't equal  views; views are much subtler). So one should practice that sort of "non-clinging", but without confusing it with the abandonment of upādāna. 

    
    >But can someone give me a good example of a typical wrong assumption of an external self that I’m sure *we all have the habit of doing.* 

    So what I'm saying is, yes, there is a "habit" of doing it, but , it won't actually be stopping even temporarily until one gets the Right View. You couldn't possibly take that habit back up once you actually abandoned it, since it would be like deliberately picking up a 100-pound load that you had absolutely no reason for carrying, having finally noticed that you had it on your back and dropped it.

    The implication of wanting to get "outside" of the experience is there to be recognized most acutely when there is the pressure of agreeable or disagreeable things. What the puthujjana's mind in either case (both of which are __painful__ in the [ultimate sense](https://suttacentral.net/sn36.5/en/bodhi?lang=en&reference=none&highlight=false) automatically assumes is that there is some sort of "base" where it can stand that is outside of the pressure being experienced, and that from that "base" it has the ability to control the feelings that arise.

    When the feeling is pleasant, it will assume that it has the power to increase that feeling, when it is unpleasant, the opposite.

    And why is it an assumption?

    >In dependence on the eye and forms there arises eye-consciousness. The eye is impermanent, changing, becoming otherwise;  forms are impermanent, changing, becoming otherwise. Thus this dyad is moving and tottering, impermanent, changing, becoming otherwise.

    ―SN 35.93

    Here is where it's crucial not to think that impermanence and dependent origination are "processes", which would only re-introduce the assumption.

    What the highlighted part means is that that "base" that a puthujjana assumes to be outside of whatever they're experiencing can only control the experience *through* intentions. So, if those intentions are provided by the experience/pressure, how could it be possible for those same intentions to be "applied" to the experience from the outside, so as to guarantee, in the way you assume, that the experience will change in the way you want it to?

    This is not to say that you can't choose to get up and start walking if you simply decide to do so. It's that the "level" where the pressure, the way it feels, you fundamentally can never change through the actions and intentions that are already *within it*. It would be like scratching the back of your hand with its own fingers. So you can basically do anything with those "fingers" (the arisen intentions/cetana) *except* do something to your hand, which is, in this case, the only thing that could guarantee your happiness.

    So, in a sense, it's not that there is "no outside" in some absolute sense, but rather that no matter how "outside" something feels, how much it feels like it will rescue you from the pressure you are experiencing, fundamentally it's still within that experience here and now. When you think about the brighter future and hope to bring it about through your intentions, that is within that situation here and now, and the outcome will be determined by that situation as a whole (including both internal and external factors) regardless of how much you crave for it to come about.

    Thus, it's not about determinism, as in saying that everything has a fixed course and thus whatever you do makes no difference, but that the outcome of your choices is always ultimately and fundamentally uncertain. That's because even if all the external factors are in place, fundamentally what you want is not an "object" in the world, really. What you want is a *specific form of pleasant pressure internally* in regard to the objects of the world. So even if you get exactly whatever *objects* and *perceptions* you want every single time, there is always plenty of room for the *experience/pressure* of the object to not be what you actually wanted, e.g. because you're in a bad mood now, and you have no say in that.

    If you truly had that outside "base" from which you can control what you feel the way that the mind naturally assumes, you would never suffer. You can certainly re-claim your happiness *sometimes* by commiting certain actions, but you should never lose perspective about the fact that every single time you succeed in that, it's pretty much by accident. Then you will realize that, even if there is a 99.9% chance of succeeding in getting what you want, it's never worth getting drunk on that possibility. Since you are not "outside" you will also have no escape from the increased unhappiness of you not getting what you wanted or losing what you had *at some point*, when the streak of luck ends, and you will be confined within that displeasure.

    (This is one of the reasons why people in the Buddha's time had less difficulty seeing the Dhamma on average. Now it is easier for the same or lesser amount of effort to lead to a greater amount of rewards, thus, on average, reinforcing the ignorance of the uncertainty of choices.)

    
    Edit: 

    >This is not to say that you can't choose to get up and start walking if you simply decide to do so. It's that the "level" where the pressure, the way it feels, you fundamentally can never change through the actions and intentions that are already *within it*.

    So you can start walking all you want, but there is ample chance that you will *not* stop feeling the displeasure of restlessness, for example, or that going where you want to go will not make you feel good.

### Praise and blame

I realized right now I’ve always hated being wrong because I always associated being wrong with blame from others. And the same is true for why I’ve loved being right; an implicit love for praise. I used to go out my way to get praised by others, at least that coarse level of behavior is not longer present in me. But love for right and hate for wrong are still really just disguises for praise and blame.

How to overcome praise and blame? What are the drawbacks, danger, and escape with regards to praise and blame? How does one see them? I can list the drawbacks on a mundane level, but I’m tired of mundane stuff.

Wanting praise and not wanting blame are still sensuality, so I suppose seeing the danger in sensuality would have to result in overcoming praise and blame?

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/17vmmyz/praise_and_blame/k9ga47j/)** _2023-11-16 03:03:56_:

    >Wanting praise and not wanting blame are still sensuality, so I suppose seeing the danger in sensuality would have to result in overcoming praise and blame?

    Not all the way. You could lay out two types of concern for praise and blame:

    The first is related to the first three fetters, and is basically the fact that one is affected negatively when one's *views* are criticized and elated when they're praised. Abandoning that *through knowledge of the nature of views*, not through *deciding* to stop holding them or to not be attached, would make one incapable of being moved by praise and blame on that domain. In fact, if you were to *directly* try to not hold any views so as to not be concerned about praise or blame, you would have to prematurely relinquish mundane Right View and the utterance of another.

    Furthermore, concern for place and blame on the ultimate level is something that only an Arahant has overcome. In fact, the craving for being and craving for non-being of an anāgāmi could be illustrated best by their concern for reputation, family, honor- that sort of thing. It's a consequence of the 5 higher fetters still being there: "formless" lust, conceit, restlessness and (very subtle) ignorance.

    >How to overcome praise and blame? What are the drawbacks, danger, and escape with regards to praise and blame? How does one see them? I can list the drawbacks on a mundane level, but I’m tired of mundane stuff.

    It's essentially the same as with feeling in general. Do your best to completely understand feeling in the utmost general sense and your gratuitous attitude of welcoming and resisting it, and you become a stream-enterer (you don't become an Arahant yet), meaning you will be able to endure praise and dispraise without being affected. Then do the same thing again, you become an Anāgāmi eventually. Repeat once more, and *then* you become an Arahant, completely unaffected.

    So there's nothing special you need to do in this case, and it's not like you need to stop experiencing displeasure when other people criticize you or feeling pleased when they praise you, because that's not on you. What is on you is the lack of context of that feeling not being in your control, which will then mean that if it changes, if suddenly everyone begins to think you're an idiot, you will suffer. If the context in regard to feeling is established, then no matter how nice it feels to be praised or annoying to be criticized, there would be no suffering.

### Re: The Foundational Reality of Humans as Primates, and the Justifiability of the Path

Replying to u/DhammaGhoul's reply to my question on [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/17udn4g/question_for_bhikkhu_anigha_extracted_from/):

>I mean, what else is on offer exactly? We observe what appears to be other entities existing independently of our perception, or at least are part of consensus reality. We observe that they have occasional mutations that affect biology or behavior. We know that various environmental demands for survival and reproduction are more or less favorable for some of the newly cropped up traits. Because they are more favorable to survival and reproduction those traits get reproduced at a higher frequency and slowly spread across the population and over time form organisms with bodies and behaviors exquisitely tailored to their environment niche. Those behaviors seem to include aversion to harm or loss of resources and seeking out of benefit (or sex) and acquisition of resources.

Sure, but ultimately none of this proves that there is not a "foundational reality" (of the Four Noble Truths) *in regard to all of this* which you are talking about and which is infinitely more fundamental than it.

>You could argue a solipsistic or extreme idealism view that the material world is nothing like our perceptions and so all of that biological evolutionary conjecture is built on sand, but this seems rather odd to me and I’m not sure how it provides reason for behaving with non-harm towards these fake people and animals. Or you could argue for some sort of creationism, but I don’t see good reason to believe in that and lots of reason to believe in the contrary.

Yes, and that solipsism would be built on sand too.

**Here's the gist of it:**

All of us are entirely biological entities.

This does not invalidate the Dhamma; rather, it makes practicing it not optional if one seeks one's own welfare.

The behaviors and biological drives that you describe are an undeniable reality of *even* in the Arahant's experience, and there is basically no need to deny anything that science says as far as the body, biology and chemistry go (except when it gets into the realm of "explaining" consciousness and the mind, at which point it necessarily fails to be coherent, given that you would be (mis)using it to explain that which you're using to (mis)use science to try to explain that which you're using...)

A male or female Anāgāmi or Arahant perceives a prospective mate or a meal if they're hungry, and their body still reacts on a physiological level, and, if you insist, you could argue that this has been conditioned by millions of years of evolution (although the Suttas give a different story of how the world and humans came about, but we can put that aside for now), and they have no say in it for as long as their body lasts. And whatever processes take place "in the brain" when they perceive something disagreeable, say when they hear insults directed at them or come into contact with repulsive things, are also not in their control.

Every single phenomenon that serves as the *basis* for delight and aversion arises due to chemicals in your body, if you want to say it that way. This is why you won't be having even the pressure to think certain thoughts until you've gone through puberty, for example, or when you're gravely ill as an adult.

The Buddha tended to summarize all this with the following sort of statement:

>“Form, Rādha, is impermanent/suffering/nonself, feeling is impermanent/suffering/nonself, perception is impermanent/suffering/nonself, volitional formations are impermanent/suffering/nonself, consciousness is impermanent/suffering/nonself.

And "Māra", whose existence we also don't need to take on trust, or whom we could, for all intents and purposes, call "Mother Nature", expressed[ the same thing in different words](https://suttacentral.net/sn4.19/en/bodhi?lang=en&reference=none&highlight=false).

So, in brief, everyone's problem on this earth, including animals, is that they are a *victim* to their biology/internal chemistry. This is a problem because, fundamentally, it is impossible to guarantee that one will always be able to satisfy these biological urges, and the actions one is forced to undertake in order to quell them put one at risk of experiencing loss and displeasure that [would not be there otherwise](https://suttacentral.net/mn13/en/sujato?lang=en) (this is not the most fundamental reason why sensuality is harmful, but it should suffice for this discussion).

What the Suttas are offering us is the way to cultivate the understanding of "gratification, danger and escape" with regard to our biology, so that despite still feeling a shadow of the impulse to engage in the behaviors that biology dictates necessary, we are entirely at ease with saying "no" if we know that they'll lead to suffering (i.e., if they're rooted in passion or aversion) . In other words, we not only stop listening to our biology in cases where lust, aversion, and distraction are involved, but we also learn to no longer resist the displeasure that arises on account of this, which was the entire cause of the suffering, *not* the fact that the biological urges were being unmet (*craving*, not *feeling,* is the root of suffering).

This is basically why the Suttas refer to the 4 paths and fruits and even samādhi states as "**superhuman** attainments". It's not mere poetry.

>name *any* behavior you engage in between waking up in the morning and going to sleep at night that is not governed, fundamentally, by the “three poisons” (or at least the craving/aversion poles). Are there any at all? Look closely at the best candidate example- is there not a subtle pleasure being sought or discomfort being avoided? Aside from involuntary responses (sneezing, etc) I can think of none. \[...\] My concern is that I'm not sure freedom from craving and aversion is really a possibility for biological organisms in our planet.

This is losing sight of the forest for the trees, and it's very common among modern Buddhists. People would resolve to not change posture even if their knee hurts during a meditation session in the name of "not acting out of aversion", while in their daily life they don't bat an eye when they engage in actions of a blatantly unwholesome kind (i.e., rooted in passion or aversion, even if not outright immoral).

There are fundamentally only five things (explained in MN 76) that an Arahant is incapable of doing, and those are the things that one categorically needs to abstain from in order to practice towards that goal. Why is that? Because they're are the things that *cannot* be done without taking ownership of your biological drives. Basically any other action can *at least in principle* be performed while still seeing the drive towards it as "not mine" (which is practically measured by how the Arahant's mind wouldn't suffer at all if the arisen bodily urge went unmet; that is not to say that no feeling of displeasure would arise, since even affectivity, not only "sensations", is inseparable from one's physiology, and craving is something additional to that).

The main issue when people bring up biology in the context of Dhamma is that they use it to justify indulgence in their desires, as if evolutionary conditioning and whatnot absolves them from responsibility for the actions *they* choose to make when their bodies try to coerce them to. But if we can take our biological conditioning as a given, while *also* recognizing that we are utterly and fundamentally free to choose to give in to it or not, regardless of how hard it tries to assert itself, then the Middle Way becomes intelligible at least in principle.

The only thing that really needs to be taken on faith in the beginning is that if you continue to restrain your *choices* without trying to suppress the biological drives themselves, at some point you will stop experiencing even a desire to act out of those drives *while the drives remain.* That's because initially it will inevitably seem like the pressure of the bodily drive and the mental inclination to succumb to it are one and the same thing. But fortunately they aren't.

    I should also add: this is why the Buddha always regarded the going forth "in one's youth, in the prime of life, with fully black hair" as more  beneficial, and completely disagreed with the common Indian view that the holy life should be lived *after* enjoying sensual pleasures and growing old.

    The "drives", "reactions to pheronomes", "impulses" have become weaker by that time, and thus it is more difficult to measure what really needs to be done: i.e., make the mind completely dispassionate __*while*__ those things are there. 

    An old person can much more easily dupe themselves into thinking they don't have much craving and possess equanimity.

    Reply to u/Various-Junket-3631:

    >So while it is tempting to say that these symptoms will last for the remainder of my life (and into the next lives), I can’t definitively say that they will, even if I have the sense that they will. And yet I am not bothered by this. In any case, I am not sure how to describe or explain the “permanence” of the stream enterer’s attainment. I would like to hear your thoughts.

    That is a good criteria for what actually constitutes stream entry and not simply a mundane insight. One needs to have understood the fundamental nature of experience in such a way that one is perfectly certain that, if one's memory were to be wiped or one were to get Alzheimer's, there is no way that the insight would be forgotten. This is because only such an insight has gone beyond "the All", beyond the range of "Mother Nature", and by extension, beyond saṁsāra.

    One can technically have understood the body and so on even as an ordinary person, but for as long as this knowledge of the body depends on a specific *thought or memory*, one's understanding is still "biological", i.e. tied to this specific form, and will thus perish when it does.

    Note that I am not equating freedom here to some mystical truth behind the 6 senses that is "beyond description". It is something that one would be able to both see for oneself beyond doubt and also accurately elucidate phenomenologically in many ways, which is all the Buddha did for 45 years.

    >Then there is the question of actually being reborn as a stream enterer. Anathapindaka notably was reborn as a deva and was even heard to praise Sariputta. However I see both knowledge and memory as conditioned. It has struck me as quite odd that someone might be reborn with knowledge of dhamma. And yet the first question is cause for curiosity here.

    A human would certainly not be "reborn" (I should note that this term and "rebirth" are actually inadequate, but I will continue to use them here for simplicity's sake) with any knowledge of Dhamma at all. It would be a blank slate. Hence what I wrote above.

    Since devas inhabit a naturally more elevated state of mind (citta), they also have unobstructed recall of many things that an ordinary human could not ever hope to remember. But that's something one may choose to be agnostic on without repercussions, and focus instead on the fact that things can only be remembered as a result of this body having a functioning nervous system (which would begin to reveal the impermanence of everything, including the fruits of Dhamma practice that are still not "on the right level" as in a noble disciple).

    >After all, wouldn’t such a person be capable of assuming a Buddha’s position in the next life if this were the case?

    A noble disciple assuming a Buddha's position later on would not be possible. A Buddha is defined by the fact that he finds the way out without anybody's help, and that is simultaneously the reason why his wisdom (if we put aside claims of psychic powers and such) is far beyond what anyone else could attain. The fact that a Buddha discovers the Dhamma by himself, transcends "Mother Nature" without any outside help, **and** is able to then teach it well (unlike a Paccekabuddha) acts as a filter to ensure that whoever achieves that will have to be a one-of-a-kind individual.

    >So perhaps it is something else that persists beyond rebirth—this detachment maybe?

    You could say it that way, but it is inherently impossible for one to understand what that "detachment" is without noble insight. That's because up until that point, whatever one calls "detachment" is ultimately still biologically determined, and is linked to the memories and notions that have been accumulated in this body, even if, with the proper functioning of the body as condition, such notions seem to remain steadily of their own accord.

    ――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――

    Now a comment on "rebirth" in general:

    The reason why I said the term itself is inaccurate is because it creates a connotation that your "soul" or something along those lines, sort of "went" somewhere after "leaving" this body (and we may imagine some sort of smoke or ray of light rising out of our corpse after we die and entering a fertilized egg in another part of the world immediately). The Buddha would've ridiculed this idea, and it's not how it works. Even the term "new life" is questionable, and neither this nor "rebirth" actually exist in Pāli.

    An account of how a noble disciple would be totally confident about the existence of past and future lives could be made in the following way:

    >Transparent, bhikkhus, is this mind, but it is defiled by adventitious defilements. The uninstructed worldling does not understand this as it really is; therefore I say that for the uninstructed worldling there is no development of the mind.” 

    >“Transparent, bhikkhus, is this mind, and it is freed from adventitious defilements. The instructed noble disciple understands this as it really is; therefore I say that for the instructed noble disciple there is development of the mind.” ―AN 1.51-52 (my translation)

    This is not referring to some mystical, luminous mental image, but to the understanding of the fundamental structure of existence. When one learns how to overcome the five hindrances, which is what makes one a noble disciple, one gets to see that whatever can be called a "defilement" is actually gratuitous, as in, there is no inherent reason why it has to be there at all, and once you recognize that, *it can't be there.*

    To give a practical example, going back to the topic of biological drives, when your mind is overcome by the desire induced by the smell of your favorite food, if that mind is not developed, it will automatically fall prey to that pull, not necessarily through coarse actions, but mentally at the very least. Even if you do your very best to restrain yourself, there would still be a tacit assumption that *the pull itself* is the defilement.

    (continued below)
    - **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/17v0cqw/re_the_foundational_reality_of_humans_as_primates/k9aa0oo/)** _2023-11-14 23:53:51_:

        But the noble disciple has fully understood that the defilement there is *not* the force of attraction experienced by the body towards the food, but rather their tacit **assumptions** (*upādāna*) in regard to that force (assumptions of "mine", fundamentally, which is the only way that it can be felt necessary to satisfy the urge in any way).

        The fundamental nature of assumption is that it's there because the truth has never been known. You cannot at some specific point begin to assume that the Earth even theoretically could be flat (as the ancients did), unless you have never gone into outer space and seen it. If you assume that at all, you have been assuming it always*,* even before you ever explicitly thought about it. All assumptions are inherently *beginningless* in that sense. Similarly, assumptions cannot come to an end by themselves, without a new piece of knowledge being introduced into the picture.

        In this way, a noble disciple would be able to know, through an inference made possible only by their new understanding, that there cannot possibly have been a first point to this situation of being pressured by biological/bodily impulses and tacitly assuming them as "mine" (not even as an embryo, where the word "mine", "pressure", "assumption", and all abstract concepts for that matter, were beyond their grasp). [It's impossible that at one point he would've not been ignorant, and then he *became* ignorant](https://suttacentral.net/sn48.50/en/sujato), because it's an ignorance of the most overarching kind that encompasses one's entire existence from top to bottom. It's not like the ignorance of the meaning of a passage in a book or of somebody's name, which can come to be when before it was not. Such is the case only for ignorance that happens *within* biology/the body/aggregates, whereas the fundamental *avijjā* is in regard to the nature of the aggregates as a whole.

### Introduction to Buddhism

Hi all, new to this channel and very grateful for all your input.

Was wondering if you are able to recommend a book or series of essays for a person who is new to Buddhism. 

I feel may be Ajahn Nynamolis books would be too deep in terms of the content for somebody who's starting out?

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/17uyxz6/introduction_to_buddhism/k9acmch/)** _2023-11-15 00:12:31_:

    >I feel may be Ajahn Nynamolis books would be too deep in terms of the content for somebody who's starting out?

    Perhaps, if the person is not yet standing at the point where they recognize that there is an inherent problem with their existence that will not by any means be easily solved. It's unbeneficial to "knock on people's door", so to speak, so to offer them deep Dhamma like a Jehovah's Witness.

    If that's the case, you can introduce them to "Buddhism" in a very general sense, but you would also need to understand that their desire to find out what the Buddha actually taught would largely be dependent on the degree to which they feel an urge to solve that "inherent problem" that's too strong to ignore.

    It's fine for the multitude to learn about "general Buddhism", and that's what one may pass on to one's parents, for example (but after trimming away from it many of the modern wrong views, such as that meditation techniques and not wholesome behavior of body, speech and mind are what lead to peace, that if other Buddhists do something it's ok for one to do it too, that we are already enlightened, that laypeople will be spared from suffering if they cultivate craving because they are laypeople, etc.)

    A watered-down version of Buddhism that at least removes these rotten parts will be much better than any other philosophy a person who is not interested in freedom might choose to adhere to.

### You Cannot Get What You Want

I could write disparate argumentative comments about the philosophy of science, epistemology, metaphysics, ethics, and the relationship between all of those things. But these days, I don't see much of a point in existential polemics or evangelism. The only fundamental reason why people don't want to follow the Buddha's teachings in a more authentic and radical way is because they want to indulge in sensuality. Their commitment to scientific metaphysics is only a vehicle for avoiding the possibility of losing out on all the "goodies" that contemporary society provides them if they were to take up ascetic (or not-so-ascetic) religiosity. At first glance, this seems like a reasonably safe play, since the validity of the scientific metaphysic is validated every time they turn on the TV and all other metaphysical systems always seem to hinge on the (assumed) distant epistemic event known as death. (I'm not afraid of death, I just don't want to be there when it happens!)

The problem with this contemporary global ideological default option, hedonistic materialism, is that it simply doesn't work. It never works. It has never worked. The extent to which it works is precisely the extent to which you ignore the fact that it doesn't work. With ignorance, there is craving. With craving, there is suffering.

Let me explain.

I think: I want to touch that butt.

I touch the butt.

Reflection: Wait a minute. That wasn't what I wanted. I wanted to touch the butt that I was thinking about, not the one that I am now touching. One was a thought, an idealization, and the other is a tactile sensation. The butt that I touched and the butt that I thought about touching are *not* the same thing. I wanted the beautiful thing in my head and all I got was this stupid meat sack! This wasn't part of the deal!

Māra: I am altering the deal. Pray I don't alter it any further.

...He always does...but we are back to the butt. Well, at least I have *this* butt and not that lump of dung Ajahn Chah was always going on about...I know! I will change my idea of what I want to perfectly suit that which I now have! And I will pretend to myself that that is what I wanted all along and that there is absolutely no problem here at all! Butts of all kinds are accepted here! Even...this fleshy one that...despite grasping it I cannot...quite...*have* it, pin it down, like I *want*...I keep needing to think about new ways to touch it so that it doesn't get...boring...cause then I would have to *think* about...life...Nope! No problem here! No problem at all! Take that, Māra!

This recognition, the recognition of the futility of any project of attempting to glean satisfaction from the world, is available to anyone and everyone at any time. It is the most immediately available yet utterly terrifying reflection there is. Reflecting deeply in this way, you will no longer care about physics or rebirth or the ethics and epistemology of suicide. You will be met with the emotions that the existential philosophers wrote of. Anxiety. Angst. Vertigo. Nausea. You will come into direct contact with the primordial, groundless horror of your existence. And when you do, you will in that moment be prepared to listen to what the Buddha had to say.

*Suffering and the end of suffering.*

If you reflect in this way often enough, it will become clear that *none* of what is on offer in the mundane world is of *any* value. And so long as you do not give in to the temptation of suicide or a descent into insanity, so long as a Buddha has arisen in the world and made clear the resolution to the problem which you still only have an unclear but deeply pressing awareness of, you *will* eventually arrive at the Dhamma. There is no other possibility. This is the final destination, the end of the road, where radicals with nothing to lose may dig their teeth into something that is at least not completely speculative or completely nauseating.

Life is too short for metaphysics. Seek the Dhamma as if you have nothing to lose. Because, in truth, you don't.

*It always turns to dust in your mouth...*

### question for Bhikkhu Anigha (extracted from another conversation)

is the samadhi of the layman (based on sila, etc) considered 'sammasamadhi?' I know (from SN55.25-Sarakani Sutta) that a dhamma follower or faith follower possesses the faculty of samadhi (as well as the rest of the five facilities) without being a sotapanna. I guess I'd ask the same about their sati, panna, etc.

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/17udn4g/question_for_bhikkhu_anigha_extracted_from/k94qy5p/)** _2023-11-13 22:31:18_:

    >is the samadhi of the layman (based on sila, etc) considered 'sammasamadhi?' I know (from SN55.25-Sarakani Sutta) that a dhamma follower or faith follower possesses the faculty of samadhi (as well as the rest of the five facilities) without being a sotapanna. 

    Good to bring this up. This actually proves further some of our oft-repeated statements of how people should not consider themselves to be practicing the Dhamma or having the five faculties yet in order to start off on the right foot towards actually acquiring them (they are absent in the puthujjana as per SN 48.15 and all the Suttas in that series, as well as others elsewhere). 

    The most comprehensive description or what the faith- and Dhamma follower are is the entire SN 25. 

    >Sāvatthī. “Bhikkhus, the eye is impermanent, changing, becoming otherwise. The ear … The nose … The tongue … The body … The mind is impermanent, changing, becoming otherwise. __One who places faith in these teachings and resolves on them__ thus is called a faith-follower, one who has entered the fixed course of rightness, __entered the plane of superior persons (ariyabhūmi), transcended the plane of the worldlings (puthujjanabhūmi).__ He is incapable of doing any deed by reason of which he might be reborn in hell, in the animal realm, or in the domain of ghosts; __he is incapable of passing away without having realized the fruit of stream-entry.__

    
    >“One for whom these teachings are accepted thus after being pondered to a sufficient degree with wisdom is called a Dhamma-follower,one who has entered the fixed course of rightness, entered the plane of superior persons, transcended the plane of the worldlings. He is incapable of doing any deed by reason of which he might be reborn in hell, in the animal realm, or in the domain of ghosts; he is incapable of passing away without having realized the fruit of stream-entry. 

    >“One who knows and sees these teachings thus is called a stream-enterer, no longer bound to the nether world, fixed in destiny, with enlightenment as his destination.” 

    ―SN 25.1 [one of these two is what Sarakani himself was; *technically* he had sotapatti-path, not sotapatti-fruit]. 

    What follows from this is that, unless a person is willing to declare themselves to be permanently free from the lowers realms and belong to the plane of ariyas, one cannot even assume oneself to have "placed faith in these teachings and resolved on them". That will have to be either because one doesn't know where to look when the Buddha says "__the eye__ is..." (or any of the other phenomena mentioned in the other 9 suttas of this Samyutta) or because one has not sufficiently clarified what "is impermanent, becoming otherwise" and so on means, and one possibly takes it to be some sort of "constant flux" of particles or lack of __*"Real Substance"*__ in things. 

    The first shortcoming is resolved by learning to grasp the hints of the mind, which requires non-delight in company (AN 6.68) and of course virtue and sense restraint without which true seclusion is not possible, hence it always comes *later* in the Gradual Training (see the post "signs of the mind" on the sub). 

    As I've been mentioning a lot recently, people in the Buddha's time obviously didn't have to go through this first step, but that's because they already recognized the hints of their mind naturally more than the average person today (how many people nowadays would listen to a Dhamma talk like [this](https://suttacentral.net/mn54/en/bodhi?lang=en) and react to it in the way Potaliya did, considering he seems not to actually have become a sotapanna but simply an ordinary follower? Most would start immediately grasping at straws to find fault with what the Buddha is saying). 

    The second shortcoming is overcome by striving to abandon wrong views and cultivating right views, and that is done by reading the Suttas carefully and honestly and studying Dhamma materials that do not contradict them. 

    As to the samādhi, sati and paññā of such a person, it's not at all that they're doing some sort of "method" to see that for example the eye is impermanent, and to purify their minds from obstructions by contemplating that (which they can do, and that's their samādhi; the "method" part is what is gratuitous). As it says, they simply either *have faith* in that or have pondered accurately on its meaning, and they would be able to recognize it on the most general level of their existence, not just when they're sitting quietly cross legged or been on retreat for a while (which they might even not be able to do if they're busy householders as many were, including kings and extremely wealthy people). 

    This makes it sound like anyone can become one of these two followers and that it's too easy, but the real takeaway here is that even faith in the Dhamma and an truly accurate understanding resulting from pondering on it are *__way__* harder to achieve than people realize.

    >"cetanāhaṃ, bhikkhave, kammaṃ vadāmi" 

    What's important to remember here is that the Pali Suttas are not giving us a perfectly consistent network of terms and definitions, and some words are sometimes used broadly and loosely.

    Here, the word "cetanā" is referring to what we now in our elucidation of the Suttas would call *"intentional intention"*, meaning that when a possibility to do something offers itself, __you__ choose to go for it.

    That is your kamma, and understanding that principle and ceasing to fuel it is how you free yourself from kamma as well. An Arahant still has intentional intentions, but they are free from kamma because there is no craving behind those, meaning that their mind would not give rise to any states of lust, aversion or delusion if they were to refrain from making the choice out of the arisen possibility. 

    This is why they are incapable of breaking the five precepts for example, since those actions would always be rooted in not being able to put up with the arisen unskillful possibility and needing to go with the grain of it instead.

        Regarding this:

        >What's important to remember here is that the Pali Suttas are not giving us a perfectly consistent network of terms and definitions, and some words are sometimes used broadly and loosely.

        That doesn't mean that the Suttas are not consistent enough so that for every proposed argument X that the Buddha would not agree with, there would not be a corresponding Sutta Y that disproves it in a way that is unambiguous and does not depend on those terms that are loosely used (like viññāna or saññā at times too). 

        And often the tenuous and unjustifiable arguments that are made based on (or I should say *in spite of*) the Suttas rely on such loosely used terms.

### Review of "The Jhānas and the Lay Disciple According to the Pāli Suttas"

Yesterday I came across an article by Ven. Bhikkhu Bodhi titled ["The Jhānas and the Lay Disciple According to the Pāli Suttas"](https://www.budsas.org/ebud/ebdha267.htm), which happens to accurately disprove the contemporary idea that the jhānas are indispensable for stream-entry, and should also make lay followers of this day and age who think of themselves as jhāna-attainers seriously re-consider whether they are right in assuming themselves to be capable of a superhuman attainment that the *enlightened* lay followers, who had been receiving direct instruction from the Buddha for many years in his time [were not capable of](https://suttacentral.net/mn14/en/sujato) (the point is implied throughout the article as well, not just in this Sutta).

It seems the author does not realize this, but his conclusions also implicitly add weight to the argument that samādhi is not "concentration" on an object. This is because the recollections of the Triple Gem, virtue and generosity, the "pleasant abidings here and now"―a term for samādhi―cannot be taken as "objects" to give one's fixed attention to in any meaningful way. 

We have [in the past](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Xor6zqSrdG4) spoken about how the recollection of the Triple Gem is a form of "pleasant abiding here and now" that would be accessible to a noble lay disciple who has gained unshakable confidence in the Buddha's teaching (stream entry), and that the jhānas require a higher degree of restraint, specifically celibacy. This is further supported by the article, which proves the point that sammāsamādhi is not limited to the four jhānas, despite them usually making up the factor of samādhi in the Noble Eightfold Path. This fits perfectly with [AN 6.73](https://suttacentral.net/an6.73/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin) that we often quote: attaining those 4 establishments of mind is impossible for one who has not fully discerned the danger in sensual pleasures, which would necessarily be the case for whoever continues to partake in them on the coarsest level of sexual intercourse. 

There exists a custom of using either "buddho", "dhammo" or "saṅgho" as individual "mantras" in the name of recollection of the Triple Gem, but hopefully, no one who has studied the suttas would claim that the world fails to realize [the Deathless](https://suttacentral.net/an9.47/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin) owing to a failure to perform this mechanical, mental repetition of a mere sound properly. 

The word translated as "recollection" in this case is just the word "sati" with the prefix "anu", so, to argue based on logic alone, whatever can be called a "recollection" should be very close in its manner of practice to what "anapana-*sati*" is. It would be ludicrous to suggest that the theme of one's practice of samādhi would completely change how it is developed, and __what it even is__. 

The contemporary "breath observation" and the associated techniques used to aid it such as "counting"— and just the general idea that sati of the breath is to be centered around the awareness of body parts and sensations—form a completely different approach to practice than what would be done by recollecting, for instance, your conviction in the righteousness of the noble saṅgha, or the qualities of the Dhamma being "well taught, visible here and now, timeless, etc.". Such direct-attention and sensation-observation  practices not taught in the Suttas— unlike this recollection of the Triple Gem, or the *understanding* of the breath that is the authentic ānāpānasati ("breathing in long, he *understands* (pajānāti :: paññā) [the action of] breathing in long" —Ānāpānasatisutta)—result in an entirely different mental state.

This is a fundamental crossroads, as these two forms of practice are so divergent that only one of them can be "sammāsati"—and only one claims support from the Suttas. The fact alone that both result in feelings of pleasure is a very tenuous link. Yet the most important consequence of following either is the radically different sort of "knowledge and vision" that will be attained. As the Buddha [makes sure to tell us](https://suttacentral.net/an10.103/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin), incorrect samādhi *does* result in knowledge, and even in a type of "liberation". 

As evidenced by [AN 10.106](https://suttacentral.net/an10.106/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin), the liberation that is not of the right kind leads to unskilful states. Here it must be kept in mind the fact that "liberation" is by definition always *pleasant* and *unburdening*, and frees one from one's issues (or at least so it will seem). Also, the previous factor of "knowledge" resulting in "liberation" will always by nature appear as enlightening and earth-shattering when it arises. This danger is made worse by the fact that the ordinary person [does not see unskilful as unskilful](https://suttacentral.net/MN9/en/sujato), and is said throughout the texts to be "untrained and unseeing of the noble Dhamma", which of course includes sammāsamādhi.

Finally, it should be clear that we would, of course, choose to disagree every single time the word "concentration" as a translation for samādhi occurs in the article, and with commentarial notions such as "mundane jhānas",  "access concentration", and Visuddhimagga-biased, etymologically unjustifiable renderings such as "one-pointedness". Apart from this, the author's conclusions, someone whom we can at least give due credit for having studied the Suttas more than nearly anyone else on the planet, are mostly solid and well-supported. 

On nearly all other instances apart from this paper we would disagree with the author, including even the footnotes on his translations of the Nikāyas, and his renderings of many crucial terms in the translations themselves, where he sides with modern/commentarial interpretations. 

Notable excerpts: 

>•__The texts sometimes speak of the worldling jhāna-attainer as "an outsider devoid of lust for sensual pleasures."__ [This connects with what I've alluded to in my latest essay and Dhamma talk: that one who learns to abide in and develop the jhānas taught in the Suttas would *have to* become free from sensuality, *even* without noble attainments].


>•"What is noteworthy about this list is that samādhi, as a faculty, does not determine a class of its own until after the fruit of stream-entry has been realized. That is, facility in [composure] determines a distinct type of disciple among the arahants (as the both-ways-liberated arahant) and among the aspirants for the higher stages (as the body-witness), but not among the aspirants for stream-entry. In this lowest category we have only the faith-follower and the Dhamma-follower, who owe their status to faith and wisdom, respectively, but there is no type corresponding to the body-witness." 

>•[...] the thesis that jhāna is necessary at every stage of enlightenment claims powerful support from the canonical account of the Noble Eightfold Path, which defines the path factor of right [composure] (sammā samādhi) with the stock formula for the four jhānas. From this definition, it might be argued that [...] the jhānas are indispensable from the first stage of awakening to the last. 
This conclusion, however, does not necessarily follow. [...] It could be that attainment of jhāna is necessary to complete the development of the path, becoming mandatory at a relatively late point in the disciple's progress." 

>•...since the passage simply inserts the formula for the four jhānas without qualification into the definition of the [composure] faculty, we would have to conclude that all noble disciples, monks, and lay followers alike, possess all four jhānas, not just one. Even more, they would have to possess the four jhānas already as faith-followers and Dhamma-followers, at the very entry to the path. This, however, seems too generous, and indicates that we need to be cautious in interpreting such formulaic definitions. 

>•At AN 5:179/III 211, the Buddha speaks, with reference to "a lay follower clothed in white" (gihī odātavasana), of four "pleasant dwellings in this very life pertaining to the higher mind" (cattāro ābhicetasikā diṭṭhadhamma-sukhavihārā). Now in relation to monks, the Nikāyas invariably use this expression to mean the four jhānas.[25] If it were considered commonplace, or even paradigmatic, for a lay noble disciple to attain the four jhānas, one would expect the Buddha to explain the above expression in the same way as he does for monks. But he does not.

### Beautiful commitment to truth in the suttas

There are suttas like MN 35:

>Now at that time Saccaka, the son of Jain parents, was staying in Vesālī. He was a debater and clever speaker **deemed holy by many people**.  
>  
>\[After getting into a debate with the Buddha, and seeing he was wrong\]  
>  
>Saccaka said to him, “Master Gotama, it was rude and impudent of me to imagine I could attack you in debate. For a person might find safety after attacking a rutting elephant, but not after attacking Master Gotama. A person might find safety after attacking a blazing mass of fire, but not after attacking Master Gotama. They might find safety after attacking a poisonous viper, but not after attacking Master Gotama. It was rude and impudent of me to imagine I could attack you in debate. Would Master Gotama together with the mendicant Saṅgha please accept tomorrow’s meal from me?” 

Where other leaders, deemed holy by others, confidently confront the Buddha, end up being completely wrong, *and are then capable of admitting they're wrong in front of their followers*, and basically being willing to declare that their teaching was absolutely wrong.

This is an easy thing to brush off since our focus is usually on more technical aspects of the suttas. But this is a very admirable and beautiful quality to have: the only thing I'm committed to is the truth about what leads me out of suffering, *regardless* of if *I* myself am considered an esteemed person by others. I cannot imagine the level of development Saccaka had to be able to admit his wrong in front of his followers, I would certainly hesitate stating I'm wrong (and then basically go onto list the numerous ways in which I was essentially stupid like Saccaka did up there) in front of just a *single* person who valued my opinions, let alone possibly hundreds.

Saccaka's commitment there is to the truth and truth *alone*, not commitment to maintaining his followers, not commitment to maintaining his tradition, not commitment to his teacher, not commitment to his prestige, *no*: it's *only* commitment to what leads him out of suffering, because otherwise, admitting so would be basically impossible. It's commitment to a teaching in which he knows,

>**These qualities lead to dispassion, not to passion**; to being unfettered, not to being fettered; to shedding, not to accumulating; to modesty, not to self-aggrandizement; to contentment, not to discontent; to seclusion, not to entanglement; to aroused persistence, not to laziness; **to being unburdensome, not to being burdensome.**  
>  
>AN 8.53

But what I've said above there about Saccaka's commitments isn't showing the seriousness of his commitment to the full extent. Realizing the full extent *personally*, would require actually inquiring whether *I* myself -- having currently not attained sotapatti -- am committed to whatever tradition I'm in, the great community within that tradition, the teachers who I've learned from and developed much from? Am I committed to the looks, appearances, elegant manner of movements of my teacher or am I committed to whether what they *say* will lead to freedom? If whatever tradition I'm in were to be proven wrong in its fundamental doctrines and effectiveness in ending my suffering, whatever views and practices it may advocate -- regardless of whether they've been of immense benefit to me --, would I hesitate having to leave all this behind for *my own well-being*? Or am I going to then come up with excuses to protect myself from having to face the pain of leaving the tradition, the teacher, and the community surrounding it?

I certainly cannot confidently and bravely say 'yes' to all the questions above. I've always had the fear of being wrong, being told I'm wrong, absolutely *hated* being wrong. This hate was taken to such an extent that I started paradoxically loved being wrong (whilst simultaneously absolutely hating it though) so that way I can fix it ASAP and reside in safety of being right. So paradoxically again, I'd hate being told HH's wrong if that ever happens, but I'd simultaneously be forcing myself to fix that wrong.

Either way, just wanted to share this reflection here. This quality is truly one of the most beautiful qualities in my opinion, I feel like if I ever saw someone doing what Saccaka did there, I would start tearing up because of how beautiful it is.

    MN 76 tells of an even more commendable decision (and admission) by the wanderer who was the leader of a sect. Also teared up years ago during my first read of the Majjhima when I read this.

### Cover-up of the fragility of the body

As I keep reminding myself and keep re-establishing the context of ordaining *eventually*, confronting my parents *eventually*, not only have various sensualities become apparent, but the fragility of the body as well.

The fact that if I ordain and become a forest monk in the future, and I may not have access to the medical facilities we have now is *frightening*. I no longer need to mechanically remind myself of the 31 parts of the body, since every body part is 'seen' without the extra layer of medical-facilities-there-beforehand-to-fix-any-problem-with-it, the possibility of *truly* facing its changeability -- and the *implications* of it that were completely hidden beforehand; the suffering -- becomes apparent. I can no longer hide behind scientific advancements in the medical field to cover up the fragility of the body and its implications with regards to *dukkha*. 

I occasionally have toothaches; these were previously not problematic at all; of course, I wasn't going here and there telling myself that our current medical facilities are there for me in case something really bad happens, but the belief was there implicitly instilled within me from since I was young. Now when that assumption is being questioned (will any of this really be there for me?), the toothaches acquire a new meaning: having to *actually* face change, and the possibility of that negative change not changing for the rest of my life. This is *exactly* the fragility I felt 24/7 when I had chronic pain for years and no one could help.

The cover-up here isn't *only* scientific advancement though. The assumption that my "parents/relatives are *of course* there for me in case something happens" so that I'm not alone, and someone can take care of me, is also another 'layer' that covered up the fragility of the body.

Beforehand, if someone said this was the problem, I would've memorized of all these facts, then regurgitate all these facts mentally and call it "contemplation", however, it wouldn't produce any fear of facing the fragility as this is doing so now. The difference is that now there's a *genuine intention* that *genuinely* targets the assumptions that the danger hid behind, whereas previously, that contemplation would've been done *through* the very place of safety that I would be trying to contemplate against. How can I contemplate the dangers of the body, the dangers of *delighting* in the body, when my entire lifestyle is in some implicit sense the maintenance of the belief that I won't *really* have to face those dangers?

It's absolutely ridiculous just how much dirt a single *honest* intention can start to uncover. No wonder none of these "contemplations" were working beforehand.

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/17sk0gt/coverup_of_the_fragility_of_the_body/k8rvpwm/)** _2023-11-11 12:02:42_:

    Yes, all of what you're describing here is essentially one of the big reasons why ordination is beneficial, despite all the gratuitous cultural and traditional baggage that has accumulated into it over time. *None of that* fundamentally offsets the benefit of exposing the vulnerability of your situation, and all the inauthentic and superficial cultural stuff will only become an obstacle for one who is inauthentic themselves.

    The 10th precept of abandoning money also makes quite a difference, and it's one of the reasons why laypeople cannot reach Arahantship, not because they don't wear a robe or have not shaven their heads. It's not *at all* the same to not have access to your bank account and go "off the grid" for months, than knowing that you will be *completely and utterly* dependent on other people's generosity from now onwards, and cannot pay for your own stuff even if your life depends on it. The former might feel unpleasant initially but one may ultimately come to enjoy it. The latter is like staring at an abyss, and it will only be pleasant to think and ponder on once you have made some *serious* progress, to the point where even falling down that abyss would not cause you suffering (although that recognition may unfortunately be mitigated by the excessive amount of wealth available in monasteries these days. Either way, the displeasure will be there if you know how to look for it, certainly the more you were dependent on the comforts of home life).

    And yes, the point you make about people back in the Buddha's day is quite accurate. It does not at all mean that those people were somehow not capable of seeking and delighting in sensual pleasures to the same degree that we can. The "amount" of sensuality is fundamentally not even that important. What really matters today is how the entire lifestyle is structured around preventing anything that may *compromise* one's access to pleasure.

    So, what really matters is not how much pleasure you've been having. What matters is how much the circumstances cover up the *impermanence* of that pleasure.

    Of course, the Buddha and his foremost disciples had been pampered throughout their youth, and even prevented from recognizing the calamities of the world on purpose. But the fact that they decided to go forth *immediately* after recognizing these things points to the fact that the amount of "dust in their eyes" was already pretty much non-existent. 

    This is not the case for anyone today who has had even a single, beloved family member die, and yet still do not feel an impulse to seek some sort of way out of suffering, nor recognize that engagement with sensuality cannot possibly be positively contributing to their predicament. And those who already have faith in he Buddhadhamma do not usually choose to intensify their practice on account of this. At least not in the sense of "practice" that matters, where they cease to engage, even as laypeople, with the things that expose them to the impermanence of life even more than is necessary.

Such is one kind of excellent thoroughbred person. This is the third kind of excellent thoroughbred person found existing in the world.

    >(4) “Again, one kind of excellent thoroughbred person does not hear: ‘In such and such a village or town some woman or man has fallen ill or died,’ nor does he himself see a woman or a man who has fallen ill or died, nor has a relative or family member of his fallen ill or died. Rather, he himself is stricken by bodily feelings that are painful, racking, sharp, piercing, harrowing, disagreeable, sapping one’s vitality. He is stirred by this and acquires a sense of urgency. Stirred, he strives carefully. Resolute, he realizes the supreme truth with the body and, having pierced it through with wisdom, he sees it. I say that this excellent thoroughbred person is similar to the excellent thoroughbred horse that is stirred and acquires a sense of urgency when its bone is struck by the goad. Such is one kind of excellent thoroughbred person. This is the fourth kind of excellent thoroughbred person found existing in the world.

    >“These, bhikkhus, are the four kinds of excellent thoroughbred persons found existing in the world.”

    ―AN 4.113

    Basically no one today lives up to even the 4th kind by nature, without having to work towards it. On the contrary, *even as monks* people don't react to the "whip" when it comes, and in many cases continue to distract themselves with monk-ly pleasures as soon as such distressing events pass.

### Separating the mind from the body.


In a previous post, it was mentioned that an Arahant's body can still react to certain situations like fear and anxiety. The only difference compared to an ordinary person is that an Arahant's mind has no ressistence towards the situation. An example was also given of how if a person was always scared of spiders since childhood, that bodily fear would still persist even in Arahanship. The only difference would be that despite experiencing fear in the body, an Arahant could, if needed, pick up that spider. That's why they are referred to as the "5 wild animals" in the suttas.

How does one make a clear distinction between the two in one's experience?

For instance, you are walking in the forest alone and recognize the features of a wild bear. Experientially, the implications of you being alone in the forest with a predator that can easily attack you will be there. That initial wave of bodily fear and body shakes will be there, the dhammas of a dark and dangerous predator will be there, and the vulnerability of your situation will be there for both the Arahant and the normal person.

But the Arahant will, despite all of these inputs and bodily reactions, still be somehow not moved while he is still moved.

So then, how can we truly measure the mind and truly separate it experientially?

The mind in that situation will be aware of all of these implications but will not want to get away from that situation or wouldn't want to change it, and this will be known by the observer and would be one dart less hitting him. Despite the seemingly overwhelming situation, an Arahant will not be moved despite being literally moved. He will not be moved because despite everything that could be happening, he has already created a space in his mind where suffering can't follow him. That space experientially will be felt like ease despite everything that could be happening. Like finding release within confinement.

So, as long as we find ourselves having the urge to make a change in whatever situation that has presented itself to us, then we are compromising our freedom from that unavoidable confinement that awaits all of us.

So, in brief, dhammas and implications remain. Feelings remain. Bodily reactions remain. What doesn't remain is the mind's resistance towards anything.

These have been some of my ponderings, and I would like to hear what you guys have to say about this matter.

    Correct:

    >I am not __afraid of fear__

    >our Teacher is __skilled in the Deathless__

    >the Path on which fear cannot land

    >by that Path the monks go.
    ―Theragātha 3.1

    
    However, it has to be born in mind that these descriptions are used for the sake of pointing people towards the correct way of relating to these experiences when they arise. It is ultimately a matter of semantics to say whether fear, or any other emotion, does or does not arise in an Arahant, and this is evidenced by so many Suttas in which it is said that Arahants are utterly and completely free from suffering and live in perpetual peace, and yet you find passages like the one in MN 121 (the last Sutta quoted below is synonymous with this) describing how the mere endurance of the 6 sense bases constitutes a "disturbance" that the Arahant will not be free from until the body breaks apart (the difference between Nibbāna-with-remainder and Final Nibbāna), but is not an issue whatsoever, as the Arahant is said to not long neither for life nor for death.

    What I mean to say with "used for the sake of pointing people towards the correct way of relating to these experiences" is that, if you tell a person that *fear should not arise,* what will happen is that, whether they like it or not, due to not seeing the signs of their mind and where greed, aversion and delusion actually are (MN 9 says from the start that only the sotapanna clearly knows wholesome as wholesome and unwholesome as unwholesome) they will most likely end up trying to *get rid of* and *interfere with* things that are within "the All", and this is not the Middle Way, and is "like a dog tying itself even tighter around the post", to use a simile the Buddha gave in a different context. This Sutta puts it best:

    > “Bhikkhus, *__All__* is __of a defiling nature (saṁkilesika-dhamma)__. And what, bhikkhus, is the All that is of a defiling nature? The eye is of a defiling nature Forms … Eye-consciousness … Eye-contact … __Whatever feeling arises with eye-contact as condition__ … that too is of a defiling nature

    >“The ear … The tongue … The body … The mind … Whatever feeling arises with mind-contact as condition … that too is of a defiling nature

    >“Seeing thus, bhikkhus, the instructed noble disciple experiences revulsion towards the eye, towards forms, towards eye-consciousness, towards eye-contact … He understands: ‘… there is no more for this state of being.’”

    ―SN 35.38 [expanded from the abridged version in the translation]

    And this connects perfectly with

    >For one who has abandoned greed,

    >and does not become greedy __amidst that which incites greed__

    >greed falls away from them

    >like water drops from a lotus

    [...]

    >For one who has abandoned aversion,

    >and does not become averse __amidst that which incites aversion__

    >aversion falls away from hem

    >like a palm nut from it's stem.

    ―Itivuttaka 4.9

    
    The point here is that, whether you like it or not, the mere arising of *any phenomenon whatsoever* is of a defiling nature, meaning that, if your practice consists of preventing certain phenomena from arising and ensuring that only certain others manifest (e.g. a bodily displeasure on account of a spider "should not" arise, but bodily equanimity or joy on account of a spider "should" arise), *you are defiled by what you think is "fine", and have failed to equally turn the mind away from*. (This is incidentally how mettā is often wrongly practiced).

     SN 35.28 is even more specific, mentioning greed, aversion and delusion specifically, point being that the problem is not that there is a fire in everything whatsoever that arises, but that because there is no dispassion, you are *touching some of it* always, and that is your suffering. Thus, when the noble disciple becomes fully dispassionate towards that which has fire in it (the entire world, internal and external), they will know that birth is destroyed and the holy life has been lived, as the discourse  ends.

    So, by telling a person that they need to allow even the fear to endure, what they will eventually learn to do is recognize that no amount of something that comes within the range of "the All" is truly the issue―because fire is harmless in and of itself―and they will be able to discern the subtle, gratuitous attitude "behind" the All, which is essentially craving. 

    However, it's important to note that there is absolutely no way to see this principle "where it is" with the intellect alone, because if there were, the utterance of another would be the only factor for stream entry, and there would be no need for developing yoniso manasikāra. There is no way to conceive of how the experience of a sotapanna, let alone an Arahant, is able to be without conceivings, because, as per MN 1, conceiving is what makes one a puthujjana.

    Thus:

    >So, in brief, dhammas and implications remain. Feelings remain. Bodily reactions remain. What doesn't remain is the mind's resistance towards anything.

    Yes, but one has to understand that even the thought of "what doesn't remain is the mind's resistance towards anything" is inevitably __ wrongly conceiving something that is within the All as "what doesn't remain"__, for as long as one is a puthujjana, and there is no way to "crawl out of that" even for a moment without ceasing to be a puthujjana. 

    In other words, the puthujjana's mind is conceiving an impermanent circumstance (the All is also defined by being utterly impermanent as the other Suttas in that series show), a particular, circumstancial, changeable configuration of the All as "freedom", and this is why the puthujjana does not see the Four Noble Truths, no matter how much sense they make intellectually, and how much they may like to believe that they're observing them in their experience and "doing their 4 respective duties" of understanding, abandoning, experiencing, and developing.

    It should be pointed out too that when it is said that "bodily fear still arises in an Arahant", the person without the Right View who does not see paṭiccasamuppāda will also not be able to see that what qualifies any given experience as what it is, is that which it simultaneously depends upon. In this case, if we classify "fear" as pressure (phassa) or feeling loosely speaking, that is *determined as what it is* by the six sense base (salayatana), as the PS "chain" tells us. 

    Thus, if the six sense base has *ceased to be a determination* (sankhara), whatever requires it as its simultaneous basis to exist will have "ceased" too. The feeling or pressure that may arise on account of the six  sense base is "ceased pressure" ("empty and hollow" as Ajahn Nyanamoli has described it in he past) meaning that it absolutely cannot be compared with what is happening when paṭiccasamuppāḍa is going with the grain in the ordinary person (anuloma), as opposed to against it (patiloma) with the Arahant.

    My recent essay about the [4 satipaṭṭhānas](https://www.hillsidehermitage.org/seeing-a-body-within-the-body/) is all about the principle that makes things cease to be sankharas when the Noble Disciple recollects it, and recognizing the principle at least would have to lead to sotapatti.

     >So then, how can we truly measure the mind and truly separate it experientially?

    Through the sustained *lifestyle* of virtue and sense restraint, you eventually learn to see the "extent" of the All whether you want it or not, which is where the pressure to act out of unwholesome things will be arising. 

    __The "container" within which the "stuff" of the All has to remain within long enough for you to see it is "leaking" as soon as you break your sense restraint,__ as Ven. Mahāmogallāna put it in SN 35.243. (This is usually translated as "corrupted" but the word "avassuta" which is the title of the discourse and the underlying metaphor really means "oozing; seeping; leaking").

    
    That is the necessary basis to start discerning the "distinction" between things and your craving on the right level, and one also should know the gist of what SN 1.1 describes. Initially one's efforts in that attitude to "not delight in things without trying to get rid of them", as we say, happening within the virtue and sense restraint, will be inaccurate. But if at no point one dupes oneself into thinking that one is succeeding in seeing the distinction between feeling and craving, one will eventually see for oneself what yoniso manasikāra really is, at which point he Four Noble Truths will be obvious, and "the All" will remain what it always was, in the following way:

        >"Why now do you assume ‘a being’?
        Māra, is that your speculative view?
        This is a heap of sheer formations:
        Here no being is found.

        
        >"Just as, with an assemblage of parts,
        The word ‘chariot’ is used,
        So, when the aggregates exist,
        There is the convention ‘a being.’

        
        >“It’s only suffering that comes to be,
        Suffering that stands and falls away.
        Nothing but suffering comes to be,
        Nothing but suffering ceases.”
        ―SN 7.10

        But, again, the ordinary person will hear "this is just a heap of formations", and the peripheral attitude of their mind that they still cannot see (cittanimitta) will―*literally* like a wild animal that does its own thing no matter what you tell it, hence we use that comparison so much―interpret that as *"the heap of formations  must become different"*, i.e. __Nibbāna is the fact that the All is now a certain way as opposed to another__, and that is management, not *uprooting* of suffering, the title of [this talk](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zndwMKAszWM).

        Note also how the above Sutta does not say that suffering "does not exist" and the Arahant becomes unaware of it. It's simply that the full dispassion of the purified *citta* (as in, it's not *them* being dispassionate, because "they" are the heap of formations that is nothing but suffering) makes it impossible for them to become involved with it and "touch" the fire as in SN 35.28 above, and thus there is impossibility to suffer *amidst* suffering, as Ajahn Nyanamoli likes to put it. Or, there is "Stillness Flowing", as Ajahn Chah often said.

        All this may make the path sound easier and that there is not much distance between a puthujjana and an Arahant, but it's completely the opposite. The distance that there is is immeasurable, literally. It's just that whatever the puthujjana conceives that "distance" to be is not what it is. Thus, when they walk along that "direction", they are not approaching Arahantship, they are approaching a different kind of All that is less unpleasant, but they will still be "touching it" and getting burned―without recognizing it of course. Only the stream enterer and above has gained the blueprint to "bridge the gap" between themselves and the Arahant.

        
        Pretty much all of what I wrote [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/17radll/ive_been_having_crisis_lately) is closely related to this topic, and the reply on the other thread titled "meanings" is pointing to the same principle. All of this is just describing the Middle Way.

        (I know this is even longer than usual, but this is the core of the Dhamma that can basically never be fully exhausted in explanation.)

        Edit: fixed some typos.
- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/17s4wti/separating_the_mind_from_the_body/k8rryyb/)** _2023-11-11 11:19:42_:

    In the process of writing the other reply, I eventually forgot to add that there is a big "but" to all this. 

    When the mind is established in samādhi, even the body calms down, as the Suttas say. As in, the powerful, sharp feelings that may have otherwise arisen, say by the Arahant coming across the spider, will not even arise at that moment. This is why Ven. Mahākassapa in SN 16.5 decided to stay in his austere environment, which meant that he would have even easier access to the jhānas that in a more comfortable setting ("I see for myself a pleasant abiding here and now", the first reason he listed). As in, that's more pleasant than having to experience the "disturbance of the body" mentioned in MN 121 *without* samādhi, but either way there would be no suffering if he had to leave that environment. This is one example of how an Arahant can perfectly well still have "preferences", something contemporary views would sometimes deny.

    The "body calming down", which means essentially the senses,  is what SN 35.247 refers to, where the animals eventually become tired and lay down, a simile for how the senses cease to pull towards agreeable things and away from disagreeable ones.

    This Sutta illustrates very well our point that what leads to samādhi is sense restraint and the practice of sati as *recollection of a context*, not *attention to one thing*. As it says, you tie the animals to the post, and then __let them try to get away as much as they want, making sure only that the rope and post (context) do not budge__. This is what you do with right context and yoniso manasikāra, as opposed to the contemporary approach of taking up an object, which is more akin to shooting the animals with a tranquiziler gun so that they stop pulling ASAP.

    Therefore, the practice of samādhi is not something *apart* from the withstanding of pressure without delighting in it that I have been alluding to here. It's not about "suppressing things", as some would say in regard to the five hindrances. That is not within the Middle Way, so whatever wisdom that samādhi will give rise to, no matter how calm your body feels, is not the right one. For this reason there is wrong samādhi and right samādhi mentioned in the Suttas many times, and wrong samādhi is there when wrong view is there, i.e. that the All is the problem, not one's craving in regard to it. *There is no mention that there will be some sort of alarm warning you that "this is wrong!",* since otherwise no one would practice it, keeping in mind the fact that the puthujjana fails to see skilful as skilful and unskilful as unskilful by definition. "Wrong samādhi" would naturally be taken by practitioners as that which anybody but them might be doing, and as some ridiculous practice that only adherents of other religions would engage in.

    So, quite contrary to what people often misunderstand from our instruction, "enduring things on the right level" long enough naturally results in samādhi, and in the body calming down. It's just that one initially needs to be able to take on trust that what one's wild mind is trying to convince is the true problem (the All, the feeling that has arisen, the perceptions of fear, whatever), actually isn't. This is why, in AN 10.61, "faith" or "trust" (saddhā) is said to be the prerequisite for yoniso manasikāra, which is what "starves" the hindrances according to SN 46.51.

    Last but not least, "body becoming calm" in samādhi does not *necessarily* mean sitting still, since, as said above, that primarily refers to the senses and their pressure, not to one's bodily posture and sensations. And one thing is absolutely sure: the first jhāna would not involve sitting perfectly still, given that vitakkavicāra is naturally a form of movement in relation to the 5 senses. 

    AN 3.64 (SuttaCentral numbering) has one imagine the Buddha, walking, standing, sitting and lying down while his mind is in the "celestial abidings" of the four jhānas.

### meaning

are we looking for the meaning of something

or do we give meaning to something

this phenomenon that we called a perception can be called a meaning too isnt,it?

It can be said that in the beginning we give meaning to everything, especially when we were a new born baby, a child and do not know even the meaning of the language we use.

So what is the correct meaning according to the Buddha? 

And what criteria are used to understand that a perception is a wrong perception? 

How does meaning become a tool or one of a vehicle toward right view?

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/17s275j/meaning/k8pxclj/)** _2023-11-11 00:16:47_:

    >It can be said that in the beginning we give meaning to everything, especially when we were a new born baby, a child and do not know even the meaning of the language we use.

    This needs qualification. "We" don't give meaning to things. Rather, the five aggregates are meaningful in and of themselves.

    The view you seem to refer to often leads to the idea that "concepts" or even "language" are the basis for ignorance, and that to achieve true knowledge one must abolish concepts and remove the meanings that experience naturally has. This is wrong view, a suggested "shortcut" to enlightenment that only covers up one's suffering in the end.

    >So what is the correct meaning according to the Buddha? 

    You could say that ultimately there is no correct meaning, and yet experience always has its own meaning at any given time, even for an Arahant. The ultimate goal of practicing the Buddha's teaching is to gain the ability allow experience to have the meaning that it has always had (the five aggregates persisting, changing or persisting-while-changing) without craving for or against it (Arahantship).

    This relates to what I wrote [here](https://reddit.com/comments/17radll/comment/k8lzw85) regarding how one must allow __any__ feeling (and of course any other aggregate), no matter on acount of what it manifests and what meaning it has, to endure.

    To use the example in that thread, the experience of faeces and urine has a meaning of "this is disgusting", and what one must do to practice properly is not *try to get rid of that*, but learn how there can come to be no aversion despite the very sharp and intense presence of that meaning. Yoniso manasikāra is what starts taking one in that direction.

    >How does meaning become a tool or one of a vehicle toward right view?

    So, in the process of developing this "ultimate aspect" of the teaching which is Arahantship, one needs to learn to discern certain meanings within the experience which are overlooked by default. These are the things that the Buddha talked about as "the practice", such as discerning the three characteristics, the four satipatthanas, the danger in sensual pleasures, and so on.

    However, the key is to be able to *recognize* those meanings in the experience as being already there, even when you were not thinking about them, without misusing them to *suppress* the other meanings that one feels uncomfortable with, such as the meaning of disgust described above, or even the meaning of "agreeability" in a pleasant sense object. Misusing them in that way entails diverging from the Middle Way.

    In other words, the right meanings can only be truly seen by *enduring* the pressure and discomfort of the "wrong" meanings. Then, once those "right" meanings sit at the background of the "wrong" meanings whenever they arise, one does not even need to cultivate the "right" meanings anymore, and this is essentially Arahantship, the ability to even forget about "dukkha" or anything else the Buddha said without any perversions of perception being possible.

    >And what criteria are used to understand that a perception is a wrong perception? 

    Thus, don't try to figure out what is wrong perception by looking at the *experience*, such as how something makes you feel or what meaning it has, given that an Arahant still perfectly experiences even sensual objects as pleasant (but they do not seek them out) and disagreeable experiences as unwanted (Ven. Channa in MN 144).

    Instead, think of "wrong perception" as being first and foremost measured by your *choice to act* by body, speech and mind in unwholesome ways with regard to the perception that was already there before you acted. By purifying that, all perversions of perception are purified.

    (All this is why the preface to Ajahn Nyanamoli's essay with the same title talks about *"understanding meanings"* instead of "looking for *"The Meaning"*)

### I've been having crisis lately

My parents are approaching old age right now, and as their son I have to take care of them. Although I care about them as they have been a good parents to me, I'm really panicking over the thoughts of one day I need to help them urinate and defecate.

&#x200B;

I've always been a clean freak, and the thought of taking care of someone else bodily fluid deeply scares me. I also visited some subreddits about caring for aging parents, and it makes me even more anxious and depressed.

&#x200B;

Idk, I guess it's just part of life and I have to deal with it, but how do you not get affected by looking at gross things and smelling them? Idk if achieving noble attainments can even make you not affected by it.

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/17radll/ive_been_having_crisis_lately/k8kmv0e/)** _2023-11-09 23:30:36_:

    >Idk, I guess it's just part of life and I have to deal with it, but how do you not get affected by looking at gross things and smelling them? Idk if achieving noble attainments can even make you not affected by it.

    Don't worry about *not experiencing* digust, because that is not true equanimity (which, despite how it may sound, makes the path immeasurably harder, not easier, but at the same time makes it doable, not a mere fatasy, after a tremendous amount of effort, contemplation, and time):

    >“Herein, what are the six kinds of equanimity based on the household life? On seeing a form with the eye, equanimity arises in a foolish infatuated ordinary person, in an untaught ordinary person who has not conquered his limitations or conquered the results [of action] and who is blind to danger. __Such equanimity as this does not transcend the form; that is why it is called equanimity based on the household life.__
    “On hearing a sound with the ear…On smelling an odour with the nose…On tasting a flavour with the tongue…On touching a tangible with the body…On cognizing a mind-object with the mind, equanimity arises in a foolish infatuated ordinary person, in an untaught ordinary person who has not conquered his limitations or conquered the results [of action] and who is blind to danger. Such equanimity as this does not transcend the mind-object; that is why it is called equanimity based on the household life. These are the six kinds of equanimity based on the household life.

    
    >“Herein, what are the six kinds of equanimity based on renunciation? When, by knowing the impermanence, change, fading away, and cessation of forms, one sees as it actually is with proper wisdom that forms both formerly and now are all impermanent, suffering, and subject to change, equanimity arises. __Such equanimity as this transcends the form; that is why it is called equanimity based on renunciation.__
    “When, by knowing the impermanence, change, fading away, and cessation of sounds…of odours…of flavours…of tangibles… of mind-objects, one sees as it actually is with proper wisdom that mind-objects both formerly and now are all impermanent, suffering, and subject to change, equanimity arises. Such equanimity as this transcends the mind-object; that is why it is called equanimity based on renunciation. These are the six kinds of equanimity based on renunciation.
    ―MN 137

    You will eventually develop equanimity that "transcends the object" first and foremost through keeping the 8 precepts and sense restraint in the right way. Instead of trying to force yourself through psychotherapy to stop perceiving sights, sounds, smells, tastes and touches as agreeable or disagreeable so as to make your restraint easier, you focus on *not resisting* the experience of disagreeable when it arises, regardless of how disagreeable it is, and not acting towards agreeable objects, no matter how agreeable they are. You don't try to "stop" either of them, which would be you claiming ownership over the aggregate of feeling. That's because feeling, no matter how intense, is *part* of the object, it's not part of "you". So if your equanimity depends on modifying the feeling, as is the usual approach, you will still be "infatuated, not transcending the object", like the passage above describes.

    This would lead eventually to the *mind* not being affected *in the face of disgust*, a reaction of your body which is ultimately not in your control, and with that any suffering it might cause you will have completely disappeared. In fact, the disgust would remind you of your freedom of mind and dispassion on the right level. Through this you would also recognize the way out of every single unwholesome state that might arise. 

    But this is absolutely not a magic pill, and it's not enough to understand it in theory. It requires a complete overhaul of the way you live to enable it, unlike the ways of developing "equanimity" you would tend to hear about today.

### Avoiding Pride From Attainments



- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/17qnt8c/avoiding_pride_from_attainments/k8gf3gg/)** _2023-11-09 03:34:43_:

    Regarding your comment above:

    >As far as my arguments go, I realized very early in my interactions here that my views are not welcome and can not be defended. 

    Perhaps you are confusing the fact that your views will most likely be met with counterarguments by default if they are discrepant with HH views (since this is an HH subreddit) with you not having the freedom to present your position.

    You may jump to that conclusion given that members might start downvoting, falling into a more personal attack and start launching borderline _ad hominems_ instead of merely refuting the relevant views and ideas, but ultimately that's every person being responsible and free with regard to the intentions behind their actions.

    It should just be clear that speaking out of ill-will and attacking people personally, in case that's what you've experienced here in the past, is not in line with HH views at all, hence not all that people say here should be taken to be representative of those views.

    Everyone is free to attempt to defend their views as much as they can in the face of the counterarguments that are presented, and there are no "forum rules", but, needless to say, discussion will not be fruitful and the purpose of the forum will not be served ''for whomever expects to be agreed with by default without presenting convincing evidence for their position. That applies even in mundane situations, not to mention the Dhamma.

    Also, I can't speak for everyone, but I'd venture to say that people would be more open to hearing and engaging in an argument when it's well supported, even if it contradicts their beliefs.

### An impressive Paticca Samuppada's mind map.

This is coming from Jayarava's blog. He is an independent researcher that I really like. He is one of the few who proved the Heart Sutra is of Chinese origins but that's another subject. I don't know if this mind map will fit with Ajahn Nanamoli's interpretation but I'm sure this could be useful. Reading this [article](https://www.jayarava.org/texts/the-spiral-path.pdf) from the same author really helps in understanding the Upanisa Lokkutara sequence.

    The issue is that even if the map were perfectly accurate, and created by the Buddha himself, being absorbed in the *theoretically correct* (in the best case scenario) content of your thoughts precludes seeing the *nature* of thoughts here and now, which is how you actually see paṭiccasamuppāda.

    So not only is it not relevant, it can even become an obstacle if one relies on detailed descriptions past a certain point. It won't be "concrete thinking" and will be abstract instead.

    The right degree of detail in explanation is simply what is necessary to point someone towards seeing that *nature* of phenomena here and now. That's the reason why the Suttas don't go further in detail than that. Not because the Buddha or the early monks were short on time.

### Stream Entry for Lay People



- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/theravada/comments/17psn98/stream_entry_for_lay_people/k8i1lhc/)** _2023-11-09 13:52:58_:

    To address the general misunderstandings that seems to be prevalent regarding the video:

    It's not being claimed that jhāna results in permanent freedom from sensuality, or that one needs to be an anagami in order to enter it. This would contradict various Suttas, most notably AN 6.60 and the case of Devadatta in general, who is said to have reached the 4th jhāna and even gained psychic powers.

    The point being made is that freedom from hindrances is a state that, *although temporary*, is *complete*. To reach freedom from the hindrances, primarily sensuality, one needs to be perfectly dispassionate towards sensual pleasures of the past, present and any possibilities of them in the future (expressed as "future lives" in MN 106). It is not a state that can be reached by suppressing particular perceptions of sensual pleasures, which is what is accomplished through focusing on an object. The *possibility* of delight needs to abandoned, but it will of course come back.

    AN 3.94 shows that even a stream enterer who reaches withdrawal from sensuality as a *temporary state*, and dies during that time, will become an anāgāmi, never again returning to this world. This goes to show that it's the same extent of freedom *at that time*. It's just that the underlying tendencies cause one to fall away from it eventually, as the case described in  AN 6.60.

    Nevertheless, the point still holds that, for a person who has attained jhāna, while they may revert to sensual pleasures again (and it is obvious that this will happen, given that those who are reborn in Brahma realms without gaining noble insight eventually fall back down), their mind needs to have reached a certain extent of understanding of the nature of sensual pleasures (see AN 6.73, the 6th prerequisite for jhāna) to reach that jhāna in the first place. So, while they may return to it in theory, it is not likely for people who have been diligently cultivating the path as well, at least not for very long if they have also been gaining understanding of dukkha and the Buddha's teaching (case in point, the person in AN 6.60 disrobed but eventually ordained again and became an Arahant).

    The difference between this and the effect that what is contemporarily conceived as jhāna has is that, fundamentally, people who attain it are on average not fulfilling the 6th condition in AN 6.73. They may recognize in theory that "sensuality is bad" because they are Buddhist and the Buddha said that, but deep down it is often clear that they hold a view that sensuality is valuable, only that they may now be more careful and restrained in regard to it, and don't let it get out of hand. This is not "seeing the danger in sensual pleasures as it truly is with correct wisdom", as AN 6.73 says.

    A stream enterer also sees that danger implicitly on account of seeing the 4NT, but due to their habits and lack of a sense of urgency due to contentment with how far they've come, they may allow themselves to be weak and still engage with sensual pleasures. While they very much still have a "perversion of perception" described in the Suttas, not fully seeing the dissatisfaction of desire, it is very different from the ordinary person who does not see their own craving, and *values* desire deep down, as something that is necessary to uphold their existence. See SN 36.6 on how a noble disciple knows the escape from pain apart from sensual pleasures, while the puthujjana does not (and it is not specified that it refers to an anagami so, it would include even a lay sotapanna who still engages with sensual pleasures on the outside).

### Not able to find some sutta

Many a time some suttas are quoted by Bhikhu Nyanmoli but I  cant find them.

Can we list some popular suttas that he mostly refer.

The one I am not able to find  but frequently quoted are : 

 (1) ' sotapanna knows that he knows.'

(2) ' when buddha  explains nibbana to putthujana, they cried, saying its almost like a death'

&#x200B;

I will add if I recollect some more such case. and also would like you to add If any you remember.

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/17plw1o/not_able_to_find_some_sutta/k86kq8j/)** _2023-11-07 06:24:49_:

    (1) The Pāli expression is "jānaṁ jānāti, passaṁ passati". It could also be translated as "knowingly knows, seeing-ly sees", with the same meaning. Usually it's watered down to 
    "really knows and really sees". A few examples:

    >“Bhikkhus, those ascetics or brahmins who do not understand as it really is ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering’—they look up at the face of another ascetic or brahmin, thinking: ‘This worthy is surely one who knowingly knows, who seeingly sees.’

    >“Suppose, bhikkhus, a tuft of cotton wool or kapok, light, wafted by the wind, had settled on an even piece of ground. An easterly wind would drive it westward; a westerly wind would drive it eastward; a northerly wind would drive it southward; a southerly wind would drive it northward. For what reason? Because of the lightness of the tuft.

    >“So too, bhikkhus, those ascetics or brahmins who do not understand as it really is ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering’—they look up at the face of another ascetic or brahmin, thinking: ‘This worthy is surely one who knowingly knows, who seeingly sees.’ For what reason? Because they have not seen the Four Noble Truths.

    >“But, bhikkhus, those ascetics or brahmins who understand as it really is ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering’—they do not look up at the face of another ascetic or brahmin, thinking: ‘This worthy is surely one who knowingly knows, who seeingly sees.’

    >“Suppose, bhikkhus, there was an iron pillar or an Indra’s pillar  with a deep base, securely planted, immobile, unshaking. Even if a forceful blast of wind comes—whether from the east, the west, the north, or the south—that pillar would not shake, quake, or tremble. For what reason? Because the pillar has a deep base and is securely planted.

    >So too, bhikkhus, those ascetics or brahmins who understand as it really is ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering’—they do not look up at the face of another ascetic or brahmin, thinking: ‘This worthy is surely one who knowingly knows, who seeingly sees.’ For what reason? Because, bhikkhus, they have clearly seen the Four Noble Truths. What four? The noble truth of suffering … the noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering.
    ―SN 56.39

    Another Example:

    >His fellow monks esteem him thus: ‘This venerable one lives in dependence on the Teacher or on a certain fellow monk in the position of a teacher, toward whom he has set up a keen sense of moral shame and moral dread, affection and reverence. This venerable one surely knowingly knows and seeingly sees.’ This quality leads to affection, respect, esteem, concord, and unity.
    ―AN 8.2

    (2) 
    >Venerable sir, can there be agitation about what is non-existent internally?

    >”There can be, bhikkhu, ” the Blessed One said. “ Here, bhikkhu, someone has the view: ‘That which is the self is the world; after death I shall be permanent, everlasting, eternal, not subject to change; I shall endure as long as eternity.’ He hears the Tathāgata or a disciple of theTathāgata teaching the Dhamma for the elimination of all standpoints, decisions, obsessions, adherences, and underlying tendencies, for the stilling of all formations, for the relinquishing of all attachments, for the destruction of craving, for dispassion, for cessation, for Nibbāna. He [137] thinks thus: ‘So I shall be annihilated! So I shall perish! So I shall be no more!’ Then he sorrows, grieves, and laments, he weeps beating his breast and becomes distraught. That is how there is agitation about what is non-existent internally.
    —MN 22

    And obviously one should note that one doesn't need to be thinking such course thoughts like "I shall be permanent" to have that view. It's enough to not see the Dhamma, 4NT,  impermanence of the five aggregates, etc. The only other alternative for a puthujjana is to think "I shall be annihilated", which again doesn't have to be a coarse idea. The idea will be subtly implied even in your understanding of the Suttas. When the puthujjana imagines what an Arahant is for example, their mind, their background context that is unseen, interprets that as "*there is no self* anymore for the Arahant", *even* if they've heard and intellectually agree with the fact that that's wrong. They just can't help it until they actually see the Middle Way and cease to be puthujjanas.

    So these are just the two subtle, peripheral, unrecognized attitudes that  one will have towards the aggregates at any given time by necessity. Once recognized, they can't be there anymore.

### Extent of sensuality

I used to read passages on sensuality on how one delighted in the senses, and thought I understood the extent of the meaning within my experience. However, all this time, I’ve only been focusing on sexuality, and now other obvious things have become apparent. Delighting in loved ones *appearing* happy, smiling, laughing; delighing in *listening* to their content and soft voices — all of this is sensuality.

This became apparent to me as I kept reminding myself to get out of the “safe spot” within my experience right now by reminding myself of the fact that I need to train myself to be strong enough to be able to ordain. As I kept doing this today, every time, the possibility of not seeing loved ones happy; *seeing* them crying, *hearing* them crying, became more and more apparent and painful. Repetitively reminding myself of ordaining felt like I was being pulled out of this shelter I reside in, not having access to that shelter feels terrifying, to the point where it felt like my actual physical heart was getting pulled somehow.

This shelter, its existence, was not at all apparent to me. I wonder all other such shelters that aren’t apparent to me; what are they? How are they found? How does one not even create any more such shelters? How does one become comfortable without them?

There is a “visible“ duality within my experience: ignore that I need to ordain, or not ignore that. Ignoring that is seeming to be the most convenient and non-challenging option, that’s the “safe spot” I was referring to. Literally everything within my experience becomes far more comfortable as a result. However, not ignoring that is absolute terror here-and-now.

    >This shelter, its existence, was not at all apparent to me. I wonder all other such shelters that aren’t apparent to me; what are they? How are they found? How does one not even create any more such shelters? How does one become comfortable without them?

    That's the catch. You can't "count" them or measure them because it's an entire *domain of existence*. It's infinite. That's why, to flog a dead horse, a meditation technique and its resulting pleasure don't actually address the problem, even though it seems to remove all the potential "shelters" you might have created and it feels like you're perfectly independent from the world internally. You're not for as long as that entire domain of false safety in pleasure is not fully discerned and abandoned.

    But yes, by restraining yourself from the specific ways of taking shelter that you start recognizing, obvious sensuality in terms of the precepts first and foremost, other ways that were not apparent before will come to light, and that over time starts to outline the entire domain.

    Before that entire domain is seen, even pulling your eyes out, living naked under a bridge and refusing to eat and breathe will be another form of "taking shelter".

    >There is a “visible“ duality within my experience: ignore that I need to ordain, or not ignore that. Ignoring that is seeming to be the most convenient and non-challenging option, that’s the “safe spot” I was referring to. Literally everything within my experience becomes far more comfortable as a result. However, not ignoring that is absolute terror here-and-now.

    That may potentially be a good sign. It could mean that you're not misconceiving it to be a magical escape from your problems. It's not.

    If you're practicing rightly, your true problems become amplified and fully visible *when* you ordain, and that's why it's the best environment to address them. 

    But if you end up using it as another "shelter", it might be worse than lay life in some ways, because the shelter can be made more comfy on a subtler level. Meaning, you start to avoid all *existential* disturbances, like being with other monks who have different views or interpretations of the rules, or being shown less-than-perfect respect as a senior monk. So you become even more existentially delicate rather than the opposite.

### New Essay: "What The Jhānas Actually Are"

**r/HillsideHermitage** | Posted by None _2023-11-04 05:00:41_
### What to know about ordination?

I’m in first year of uni currently and half-way finishing the first term. Doing fairly well, but the level of work I’m getting here is making my study of the Dhamma nearly unsustainable compared to a year ago where I had loads of free time to contemplate many things. Not to speak of the fact that there’s an increasing level of dispassion at the horrible materialistic solution being sold to me here in the West — and would likely be the same elsewhere as well. My initial plan was to complete uni, get a remote SWE job that pays well enough to help my family, but this plan seems to be fadinf away now.

I was, and still am, hesitant of the idea of ordination due to my responsibility to my parents. I’m immensely indebted to them for all they’ve done for me and my sister, and I feel a great sense of responsibility towards them. The fact that my dad has multiple chronic illnesses that makes it hard for him to work does not help either; we’re not exactly that well off financially either, though it’s certainly sustainable. My fondness of my sister and fear of my mom’s anger and upset are also things holding me back. In general, I’m scared of confronting them about this.

However, the rate at which the redundancy of all that I’m currently doing — and missing out on possibly *actually* ending suffering, seems to be overtaking this fear, and I’d guess it’s only a matter of time where the fear of not dedicating my time entirely to the Dhamma outweighs the guilt and the general suffering of leaving my family. One thing, that I’ve just recognized today, that will help me alleviate some of this guilt is the fact that my parents have saved tons of money for me to go to university which would be of immense help to them; so rather than me wasting my time and the money on random uni courses of little relevance to me, it would be better for me and them that I not further pursue uni.

The first and only time I talked to my mom about my disinterest in materialistic values to instead pursue something that at least *appears* to be more relevant to ending my suffering did not go well AT ALL. I’m fairly rational and remain composed, but every confrontation seems to take both of these qualities away and I become unnecessarily emotional, this is especially the case with my mom for some reason. As a result, I become incapable of explaining my position well enough to her. The fact that her questions are all very emotional doesn’t help me either. I feel like I don’t have enough wisdom to rightly answer questions like, “so does this mean you don’t love me?”, “you don’t care about us?”. It is because I love my family and am afraid of suffering being inflicted upon them, and recognizing the uncertainty of all that can occur and the incapability of the materialistic pursuits to help with that to *any extent,* that I want to pursue freedom from suffering (she will most likely find a way to insert the belief that I don’t care about them as a result, anyways). But I’m incapable of answering properly, my mind becomes blank. How do I answer such questions? What do I do when telling them about possibly ordaining? There is so much fear at the questions that will be asked, and little belief in my wisdom to be capable of answering them.

I plan on telling them about this before the current term ends so that way, if I get permission, I don’t end up wasting money on the next term for uni. And to prove to myself that I’m willing to go far enough to ordain, I’ll also be keeping unbroken virtue until Jan. start (ideally more, but at least this much).

In the meantime, I want to know if there’s something I should know about ordination. Where to ordain? Are there certain periods for ordination? What is the minimum age required to ordain?

For reference, I live in Mississauga, Canada, and turn 19 next May. The local sanghas DO NOT look good; if I get in, I doubt I’ll have an ounce of seclusion since they seem to be hoarded by a bunch of visitors. The fact that they’re all right in the city doesn’t help with that either. My family just got our citizenship, and we’ll be getting our Canadian passport soon, so perhaps I can travel elsewhere. But again, getting permission already seems impossible enough, but then to convince my parents to allow me to go another country alone seems to make the situation even worse..

I’m looking at SBS Malaysia right now since it seems to offer the possibility of individual practice, and seclusion, but again, same issues as above.

I also haven’t considered what to do in the situation where I’m unable to obtain permission to ordain. I’m sure the situation will get escalated if I remain insistent on wanting to ordain and my relatives, grandparents and everyone will get involved, which will not be the easiest for me to deal with.

    Yes, it would certainly be good to make up your mind before you commit to further mundane investment, especially if those expenses will be covered by your parents. That will be one more argument in their favor in the future if you ever make up your mind to ordain, and you will regret it. (I went through a very similar situation, and luckily decided to cancel my studies right on time instead of trying to juggle both Dhamma and worldly life just to appease my parents, postponing ordination to some ambiguous "later on" that would've likely never come). You also don't know what unexpected obstacles will come up over time, and any sense of certainty is illusory.

    >But I’m incapable of answering properly, my mind becomes blank. How do I answer such questions? What do I do when telling them about possibly ordaining? There is so much fear at the questions that will be asked, and little belief in my wisdom to be capable of answering them.

    If you feel like based on their views and values there is little chance that they will sympathize with you, you have to be ready to be incomprehensible to them. You can't hope that they will "agree" with you and speak praise of your decision *before* you ordain unless they're extremely devout Buddhists (which may not even be enough). Their judgement will be clouded by the looming possibility of losing something that is very dear to them, and it's unlikely that even with the best wisdom and rhetorical skills you would be able to put a dent on their conviction, which will be mostly irrational (because that's the nature of attachment). They will be arguing from a completely different dimension than you, speaking the same language only on the surface.

    They would only be able to see the value in your choice, *if ever*, which is not guaranteed, *after* you've left, and once the irrational fear subsides and the reality sinks in that they *can* actually live without you, which right now their minds will be denying too loudly to see.

    >In the meantime, I want to know if there’s something I should know about ordination. Where to ordain? Are there certain periods for ordination? What is the minimum age required to ordain?

    19 years and 6 months to become a bhikkhu, *technically* 7 years old to  become a novice. In most places you'd be expected to spend one year as a novice before higher ordination, and, depending on the place, up to a year as an 8-precept layman prior to novice ordination.

    >But again, getting permission already seems impossible enough, but then to convince my parents to allow me to go another country alone seems to make the situation even worse..

    
    >I also haven’t considered what to do in the situation where I’m unable to obtain permission to ordain. I’m sure the situation will get escalated if I remain insistent on wanting to ordain and my relatives, grandparents and everyone will get involved, which will not be the easiest for me to deal with.

    Yes, in that regard, you would have to show your determination even more firmly, especially at this age when you're still regarded as a child. And again, be ready to face the fact that they might think you've gone completely nuts or been indoctrinated by a weird cult all of a sudden, and to make it clear that even if you stay, you will not really be "part" of the family as you were before. Not in the sense that you dismiss them rudely, but that you will no longer engage in the things and behaviors which caused them to become to attached to you and "love" you in the first place, even if you were to still support them financially. 

    If they are reasonably unselfish, they would probably not like the idea of having a bore of a son that will do nothing but work, pay their bills, and stay in seclusion the rest of the time, and may prefer to let you go instead, even if it's with the hope that you'll eventually change your mind and come back. 

    Then you just make sure that that never happens, and they may eventually, over time, come to see the whole thing in a different light. If not, then that's fine too, and saying that it's still a net win by an immeasurable margin if you make good use of the opportunity is a severe understatement.

    (If you haven't already, check out the latest talk on the YouTube channel).

### Directly seeing feeling?

I can detect feelings only based on thought.if that thought is anger then feeling must be unplesant. Even immidiately after recognising thought of anger if i directly want to see feeling. I am unable.this seems like a blind mans strategy.
 Some other hints are bodily sensations at heart, head and stomouch region.

Is this my incapability, or all uses this strategy? Can i say that just like rupa we can never directly know vedana.?

    >I can detect feelings only based on thought.if that thought is anger then feeling must be unplesant. Even immidiately after recognising thought of anger if i directly want to see feeling. I am unable.this seems like a blind mans strategy.

    It is, because it's based on seeing things in the "wrong order". Your feelings are not detectable *based* on your thoughts. Rather, the things you choose to do, say or think about are a *response* to what you feel, and that's how there is lust, aversion and delusion right there-&-then, in regard to that feeling. Enduring the feeling on the right level means that whatever you do, say or think will not be proliferating the defilements, even if technically you are acting *due to* of the feeling (i.e., not *out* of it, as we say). This "enduring" would also be mutually exclusive with breaking the 5 precepts, celibacy, and aggressive speech.

    Actions and thoughts cannot occur apart from pressure/contact, but they are not unwholesome if they're not trying to *get out* of that pressure on the internal level, which is that "right level" endurance.

    >Some other hints are bodily sensations at heart, head and stomouch region.

    Not at all. These would be present on account of the "first arrow" alone, which is why it's utterly ill-advised to look for the defilements in the way your body reacts, and, the worst of all, trying to calm the defilements by calming your body. 

    The only "hints" that matter are the hints of the mind (cittanimitta), and not even in one's wildest dreams would one be able to pin those down onto bodily sensations.

### Arahantship being put to the test?

 

I'm wrestling with the following doubt:

If we were to approach Dhamma from a purely phenomenological/existential standpoint and be only concered with its immidiate utility - namely, ceasing of suffering, without dealing with it being an appropriate wider model of reality *in toto* \- it strikes me then that for a such approach to hold water it needs to yield concrete, palpable results. I.e. it needs to produce individuals clearly and observably unable to suffer in circumstances normally conducive to suffering of the pathujjanas (torture, immolation, pathological conditions, skinning, starvation, etc.). Personally I'm unaware of any such examples (but there are sadly familiar counterexamples - the suicide due to chronic pain of Ven Ñāṇavīra Thera, noted representative of existentialist Theravada). If any of you on contrary are informed of such instances it would be of the great consolation to me to be proven wrong.

On the other hand, if we were to think of Dhamma as an objectively accurate world model regardless of the number of its recent or current successful applications, in other words good medicine just without skillful enough doctor to apply it or error-free instruction manual without attentive enough user to go through it, how would it then Dhamma meaningfully differ from usual faith-based religions? Because, it seems to me, only with the leap of faith would it be possible for one to maintain their confidence in the value of Dhamma in such scenario (or am I overlooking something?).

What are your thoughts?

    Yes, to hold water *for puthujjanas*, and, as nearly every other Sutta says, the puthujjana is defined by not seeing the Noble Ones and their Dhamma, which in turn means that what they see as noble and inspiring will be misguided.

    > circumstances normally conducive to suffering of the pathujjanas (torture, immolation, pathological conditions, skinning, starvation, etc.).

    This issue here is the assumption that *that's* what the "suffering of puthujjanas" is. All such things are simply triggers that are particularly good at *amplifying* and *highlighting* the suffering of puthujjanas, which is the perilous contradiction in their situation of gratuitous entitlement to something that's not actually in their control (the non-arising of unpleasant feeling).

    
    >Dhamma as an objectively accurate world model regardless of the number of its recent or current successful application...

    It's not a "world model" that requires "proof", so it's not on the same footing as any other religion or philosophy. A "world model" is still underlied by ignorance, no matter how  accurate it is.

    If anything, you could say the Dhamma is the understanding of the *nature* of all models (i.e. views), which enables one to transcend *all* of them.  It's not just another view you "pick" in favor of the other alternatives—it is so only for a puthujjana, which is why they must never allow themselves to think they know what the Dhamma is (until they cease to be a puthujjana).

    On the mildest end, the proof that the Dhamma works is the lack of an emotional need in a noble disciple to defend their understanding from the criticisms of others, which will still be there for a puthujjana, even if their "model" happens to the closest possible approximation to the Dhamma in the rare, best case scenario.

    On the most extreme end, the "proof" is the inability to suffer *internally* despite how your body violently quakes and trembles while thugs are sawing your limbs off with a blunt saw, or the fact that you're doing your best to find a cure for a terminal illness.

    If a person's *mind* is emotionally engaged in any way while their body is immaculately still during self-immolation (which *is* doubtlessly happening, otherwise they wouldn't do such a foolish thing just to prove a point to observing puthujjanas), or while they endure torture externally with perfect equanimity, or while they stubbornly refuse to seek treatment for a disease for no good reason, there is absolutely no Dhamma there. That *is* just another "model", and not even a good one at that.

    Edit: See also [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/17cotlx/a_common_misconception_about_equanimity/) recent post I made.

### how to ask the right question?

How to ask the right question for everyday practice without being too mechanical and not become another method? 
How to ask the question so that we know ourself about what to do next? (It sounds contradicting since asking "what to do implying discontentment in itself") 
How to ask the right question for the right practice?

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/17m0aw5/how_to_ask_the_right_question/k7nfd5j/)** _2023-11-03 13:52:19_:

    By first recognizing that there is no such thing as a question that will always work. *Looking in the right place* to find the answers is what "works", even if the question is primitive or not as intricate as somebody else's.

    The assumption that there is such a thing as a question or way of directing your attention that is *in and of itself* right is what leads to mechanical practice, whether you're aware of it or not.

    That's why sometimes you can hear a new presentation of the same understanding of principle and it feels like it "clicks", but then eventually it doesn't anymore—because you started believing that the specific way of presenting the principle was the what made the principle clear, failing to see that it's how, by sheer chance, you were looking at the right place at that time.

    And this will keep happening endlessly until one gets the Right View, which is why it's necessary not to settle for anything *specific* that seems like it "works" until then, the most extreme example of which is a meditation/sensation watching technique. 

    Once one there is Right View, one will be looking at the right place *by default*, and any line of reflection relevant to the Four Noble Truths or anything the Buddha spoke about will be equally fruitful.

### Acting out of delusion?

Is acting out of delusion when greed, hatred, and delusion are being discussed. the same as acting out of ignorance. As in ignoring dependent origination or ignoring the womb of the problem?

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/17lffyt/acting_out_of_delusion/k7fs9ia/)** _2023-11-01 23:50:12_:

    You could say that you will only be able to *fully* not act out of greed, aversion and delusion once you abandon ignorance. 

    >“There are, mendicants, these two powers. What two? The power of reflection and the power of development. And what, mendicants, is the power of reflection? It’s when someone reflects: ‘Bad conduct of body, speech, or mind has a bad, painful result in both this life and the next.’ Reflecting like this, they give up bad conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, and develop good conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, keeping themselves pure. This is called the power of reflection.

    >And what, mendicants, is the power of development? In this context, the power of development is the __power of the trainees (sekhā)__. For when you rely on the power of a trainee, you give up greed, hate, and delusion. Then you don’t do anything unskillful, or practice anything bad. This is called the power of development. These are the two powers.”
    —AN 2.11

    That's because greed, aversion and delusion are already secondary products of ignorance, i.e. not seeing paṭiccasamuppāda, the nature of the aggregates etc. And only the insight of those things (and the signs of the mind especially) allows one to abandon defilements. Until that point, as a puthujjana, all one can do is *restrain* oneself from proliferating the defilements too far, which at least creates an opening to start addressing the underlying ignorance and trying to get the Right View. 

    That's why the Gradual Training is indispensable, even though the Dhamma and abandoning of ignorance is about a lot more than just behavior.

### Question about discerning wholesome from unwholesome action

Hello all, 

I asked  u/Bhikkhu_Anigha the below [question](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/16yjuh1/comment/k727p49/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) within a thread of a recent post, however he suggested it might be more appropriate and provide greater visibility if I post it separately, so I've copied it with very minor grammatical tweaks below (any input from others is welcome as well):

 

How are we to judge  whether an action or intention is skillful/wholesome rather than the opposite, when it seems like anything other than sitting perfectly still  and dispassionately awaiting starvation and death necessarily entails  some manner of discomfort avoidance or expectation of pleasantness? The  relevant considerations seem to me to hinge more on time-scale and balance of benefit to cost, but I'm happy to be corrected.

Example: You identified sexual intercourse above as antithetical to wholesome conduct, and obviously celibacy is a part of monastic life. On the other hand, I frequently see on the posted videos Ajahn Nyanamoli and others engaged in playing with and petting the dogs around the hermitage.  Now, obviously, sexual intercourse and caring for or playing with animals bear little resemblance in most ways. But, since I'm drawing the comparison in order to try to tease out the **principle criterion** by  which one judges such actions: Both involve voluntary interactions between two living entities that seemingly derive enjoyment from the interaction, get beneficial exercise from the act, and (assuming a  healthy relationship) sustain no obvious harm aside from potentially becoming accustomed to it in a way that would be unpleasant if the opportunity were removed.

Would the play with the dogs be unwholesome if one were to crave it and feel a loss when it's unavailable, and would consensual sex remain harmless if one were okay taking it or leaving it... or are there other factors that come into play? (If you find it inappropriate to discuss sex in the way this  question requires, please swap another example such as listening to music or anything else in its place). Thank you!

&#x200B;

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/17kezz0/question_about_discerning_wholesome_from/k7axyp7/)** _2023-11-01 00:23:06_:

    >How are we to judge  whether an action or intention is skillful/wholesome rather than the opposite, when it seems like __anything other than sitting perfectly still  and dispassionately awaiting starvation and death necessarily entails  some manner of discomfort avoidance or expectation of pleasantness?__ 

    This is often taken to be the meaning of "never acting out of craving", and certainly for a lot of people that is the ideal of an Arahant, which makes enlightenment unachievable (which is good, you wouldn't want to attain such a thing).

    It would be more amusing than inspiring to meet such an "Arahant", in fact: they sit down to meditate, their knee starts to hurt―now they are locked in that position until it stops hurting or they starve, whichever happens first, because "they are incapable of aversion to pain". 

    People often don't realize the implications of their ideals of what enlightenment is, and that is further exacerbated by the ubiquitous view that meditation is about stopping your thinking, rather than questioning and upgrading those very ideas, for example, since they are at the very root of one's ignorance, and no amount of awareness techniques is actually affecting that root.

    >The  relevant considerations seem to me to hinge more on time-scale and balance of benefit to cost, but I'm happy to be corrected.

    Not at all. This stems from the widespread confusion of *ethics* and *morality* with what the Buddha called "kusala" (skilful or beneficial). The considerations of kusala and akusala hinge __on your state of mind alone__, regardless of what the perceived benefit for yourself and others would be in an external sense. For instance, helping another person is akusala if your state of mind is affected with anxiety and concern, even though externally everyone would say it's "good" and meritorious (which *does* depend on things like benefit to cost, etc., but merit and skilfulness are not at all the same).

    An Arahant could choose to kill themselves if they're under significant discomfort despite the fact that it is more of a net loss to others than a gain, and that action will not a tiny bit less skilful than any other externally "good" action they may do. The Buddha himself said he could have lived longer if he wanted, but he decided to die at around 80 instead, diminishing the amount of benefit he could bring to the world. See also SN 4.23 & SN 35.87, where two Arahants commit suicide on account of severe illness.

    In essence, if your mind is polluted with ignorance, __*whatever*__ you do will be unskilful, even with the best of intentions. If it's free from ignorance, __*whatever*__ you do will be skilful and beneficial, even if the entire world disagrees with it (and, as it will hopefully be clear from what follows, sexual activity is among the very few things that fall totally outside that "whatever").

    
    
    >Mind precedes all things. Mind is their chief; they are all determined by mind. If with an impure mind a person speaks or acts, suffering follows him, like the wheel that follows the foot of the ox.
    
    
    >Mind precedes all things. Mind is their chief; they are all determined by mind. If with a pure mind a person speaks or acts, happiness follows him, like his never-departing shadow.
    
    ―Dhammapada 1-2

    
    Thus:

    >Both involve voluntary interactions between two living entities that seemingly derive enjoyment from the interaction, get beneficial exercise from the act, and (assuming a  healthy relationship) sustain no obvious harm aside from potentially becoming accustomed to it in a way that would be unpleasant if the opportunity were removed.

    That is not at all the criterion. Sure, being in a healthy relationship is more *meritorious/ethical* than being in an abusive, unhealthy one, but wherever there is ignorance and craving, there is unskilfulness *because of that*, not because of how the relationship unfolds or such external considerations as "deriving enjoyment" from it and to what extent.

    Which brings me to the main point:

    Having sexual/romantic relationships *cannot* but be accompanied by a lustful mental state, which makes them necessarily unskilful and unbeneficial in the quest for freedom from suffering. There is a huge difference in the *sphere that matters* (which is by definition the one people are blind to) between that and the example you give of playing with pets or anything of such nature, even though both things are roughly on the same footing *ethically speaking*.

    To illustrate that difference: how many people in the world lose sleep over the fact that they are not allowed to pet their dog? How many people commit mass murders on account of frustration because they couldn't pet their dog? How many people would go fall into full on depression and perhaps kill themselves if one day they can't play with their pets, like they would if one day they woke up with an impaired sexual organ that was previously functional? And, last but not least, how strong would be the impulse for most people to start grasping at straws to justify how they can still pet their dog *and* practice for Nibbāna? (no offense to you personally, it happens often).

    Whether one realizes it or not, engagement in sexual intercourse requires attachment and everything unbeneficial that comes with it in order to even desire it, and it carries with it a huge amount of emotional weight, more than pretty much any other form of pleasure you can experience.

    Whether one can renounce particular sexual encounters is of absolutely no relevance. What matters is, how much will your mind kick and scream if you tell it that it will never have that __*ever again*__? Because *that's* the measure of how much attachment to it there is, and of the unskilful state of mind behind it―which will never be recognized until you actually restrain yourself in that ultimate sense. You don't even feel its presence otherwise, and you may think everything is well and good, because that's how __*ignorance*__ works. 

    It's not the lack of insight into some esoteric truth or secret that you is solved by a  special meditation experience. It's the inability to see how you are responsible for your own suffering and that it can be stopped eventually (at a hefty price initially, of course).

    And whatever practice one does *while* that deep, underlying addiction is being normalized and swept under the rug, is not actually bringing one closer to freedom from all addictions, which is the freedom from suffering. Any "peace" one can get within that is tantamount to the drug addict genuinely having a good day every now and then. Fundamentally, they're still in just as much of a bad place until they address the addiction, i.e. *actually stop taking the drug*.

    And this is why it's said in our teachings that if you keep the 8 precepts (minus the one on eating if there's a reason to break it), almost everything else can be done in moderation, when you are crystal clear that the state of mind behind it is not rooted in craving. 

    In the example of the dogs, if you know internally that you will not be affected if those dogs die or are taken from you the next moment, there is no problem at all, and it is perfectly possible for the mind to be dispassionate during that action, regardless of how it looks to others who still don't know what dispassion is.

    But if with sexual and amorous engagement in general it *seems* like you wouldn't be affected if you can't have it, yet __you still choose to engage in it__, then you are either not looking deep enough or are fooling yourself, just as you wouldn't be scratching your skin if it doesn't itch at all―it's *literally painful*.

    Sure, that itch can be present with almost any other action as well, including the dog example, but the point is, it doesn't *have* to be, and one thing for sure, scratching any other itch will not be as hindering to the application of the cure to the skin condition.

### Is 'Rupa' external object?

Again Sorry to Ask very basic Question.

Is the Rupa in NamaRupa,/ PancaKhanda/6 dhatu same thing? or different thing?

Is that Rupa

(1) the external object that we see taste touch,....

(2) Or its my Body that's host other 4 aggregates/NAMA

"cakkhu  ca paticca Rupe ca upajjati Vinnan". In this case its obvious that  the  Rupe is external sense object. but  whether its part of  PancaKhanda/NamaRupa/6 Dhatu . that I am confused. Or is it that we only  perceive external object? So physical external Rupe is never part of  experience , instead it is represented by sanna only in the field of  experience.

History.  I asked related question in  the thread of '[Body within Body](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/176rj53/comment/k6r78dh/?context=3)'.

>^(can you draw line between 5 aggregate 4 satipatthana and NamaRupa.)  
>  
>^(can we say this secondary kaya/vedana/citta/dhamma. as 5 aggregates which is also Sense of Self for non Arhant.)  
>  
>^(so basically each experience is 5 aggregate but always contained within more fundamental existence, kaya,citta,vedana,dhamma.)  
>  
>^(OR IF NOT)  
>  
>^(And If NamRupa = 5 aggregate = 6Dhatu.then why we created 3 different representation.why sakkay is discussed in reference to 5 aggregates only, while viññanā is discussed with reference to NamaRupa. and 6 Dhatu are discussed independently.)  
>  
>^(Why PaticcaSmuppada says NamaRupa ->salayatana->vedana/(5 aggregates when NamaRupa already is made up of {Rupa+(vedana,sanna,sankhara,mansikar,cetana}.)))

For Which Bhikhu Anigha gave this reply .

>^(Any  of these different ways of looking at experience works, and the point  is not to try to draw parallels between them, which most Arahants in the  past surely wouldn't have been able to do because they didn't have  access to every single Sutta like us today.)  
>  
>^(When  you learn to see your experience as a whole properly (sign of the  mind, you don't need to label it as 5 aggregates, namarūpa and whatnot.  You simply see that the whole thing that you can control is there  enduring, standing upon something else that you have no control over.  Sakkāya will be there for as long as that is not seen correctly through  any of these frameworks that the Buddha formulated.))

On that I asked this above question on Rupa. and still waiting for answer.

NOTE : I also think that everyone should contemplate on these discussion. hence sharing this as a separate post.

&#x200B;

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/17kbsa9/is_rupa_external_object/k76xxnw/)** _2023-10-31 05:03:13_:

    >Is the Rupa in NamaRupa,/ PancaKhanda/6 dhatu same thing? or different thing?

    Trying to figure out whether it's the "same thing" or it's a "different thing" already implies misconceiving what is, as if it's something you can just look at and examine from the outside. Rūpa is that which is "below" your experience of asking a question about rūpa, making that experience what it is, and you need to learn to *discern* it there, which is the only way to "resolve" this sort of question. 

    With "resolve" I mean to say that it will be seen to be __based on a wrong premise__, i.e. that there is a sense of self that sits outside of the experience and can "observe" its fundamental components to say whether "this rūpa" is the same as "that rūpa". 

    You will never find neither nāmarūpa, nor the aggregates, nor the 6 elements on that level that you can "compare" in that manner. All you will be comparing and analyzing is the *byproducts* of nāmarūpa, etc. *already* being there, and that is ayoniso manasikāra that leads nowhere of relevance.

    >Is that Rupa

    >(1) the external object that we see taste touch,....

    >(2) Or its my Body that's host other 4 aggregates/NAMA

    >"cakkhu  ca paticca Rupe ca upajjati Vinnan". In this case its obvious that  the  Rupe is external sense object. but  whether its part of  PancaKhanda/NamaRupa/6 Dhatu . that I am confused. Or is it that we only  perceive external object? So physical external Rupe is never part of  experience , instead it is represented by sanna only in the field of  experience.

    That rūpa is the foundation for your experience of being confused at this very moment―*that's* the level where it really needs to be seen. You could say "manañca paṭicca dhamme ca upajjati manoviññānaṁ" (in dependence on the intellect and phenomena, there arises intellect-consciousness). That has given rise to your experience here and now. And there is rūpa (earth, water, fire and air) involved in that *mental phenomenon* of being confused, to the extent that the phenomenon changes, persists, and changes-while-it-persists across time. Rūpa is the reason why even your thoughts are not yours―if the rūpa of a thought is gone (e.g. you forget what you where thinking about), you can't continue thinking it for a millisecond longer.

    Thus, rūpa has nothing to do with "external objects", which is the extreme of materialism, nor do you only perceive "only representations through saññā", which is idealism. Your *idea* of "external object" or of "representation through saññā" has its own rūpa right then and there, and by thinking that the rūpa is "out there" or *anywhere* for that matter, you will fail to see the rūpa that is manifest. 

    You can't say that rūpa is "out there" or "somewhere" because rūpa is not __in__ space. Rather, your experience of rūpa is the foundation for any notion of space whatsover.

### "5" cords of sensuality

It's a stock frase we find in the suttas, I often wonder why just the 5 are mentioned why not 6. 

Why is the delight in mental phenomena not mentioned why did the Buddha make this distinction mentioning explicitly the five, or on other occasions mention in expanded form the 6 bases, objects, and consciousness.

I also commonly see people holding the view that the pleasure born of object focusing meditations is a pleasure born out side of sensuality (the 5 cords). Thus contributing to the view they have found the escape, that which is beyond sensual pleasures.

This goes along with another view I've heard, it is further more good to crave for this kind of pleasure. On the basis of the Buddha's reflection on not needing to fear jhana as it is not within sensuality shortly before his enlightenment. They also support this view by the fetter model saying rupa raga and arupa raga are later fetters so there is no need to worry about that until much later.

How does one understand why there is the distinction between 5 and 6 made? And how does one come to know that object absorption is sensuality?

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/17jr4z6/5_cords_of_sensuality/k75xiq6/)** _2023-10-31 00:21:44_:

    >Why is the delight in mental phenomena not mentioned why did the Buddha make this distinction mentioning explicitly the five, or on other occasions mention in expanded form the 6 bases, objects, and consciousness.

    FIrstly, the framework of 6 instead of 5 senses *is* used in the context of sensuality many times (see SN 35.63, SN 46.6, SN 35.246).

    But the reason why it may sometimes not be mentioned is that the mind (mano) operates "in regard to" the 5 senses when it comes to anything unwholesome. You cannot have sensual desire for something you think about unless it's something you *could* see, hear, smell, taste or touch. And that's why sensuality is never about *perceiving* the objects; it's about the fact that you're __looking forward to having them with the body__ on the level of the mind. Hence the Suttas always talk about "sights *cognizable* by the eye that are agreeable, etc." when discussing the 5 cords.

    >I also commonly see people holding the view that the pleasure born of object focusing meditations is a pleasure born out side of sensuality (the 5 cords). Thus contributing to the view they have found the escape, that which is beyond sensual pleasures.

    Yes, that's a widespread idea. But the reason this is mistaken is that jhāna is not the escape from sensual pleasures in the sense that you *stop perceiving them*, it's the escape from *sensuality* in regard to sensual pleasures, and those are two different things which people often can't distinguish. 

    You can't have sensuality without sensual pleasures, but for someone who is free from sensuality, sensual pleasures still arise for as long as they still have operating 5 senses. It's not even a matter of choice that those 5 animals will perceive certain things as pleasant (which you will not engage with if you're properly restrained) because they're *not yours*. What's "yours" is your delight and lust towards that pleasure and acting out of it.

    The escape beyond sensual pleasures, as the Suttas mention several hundred times at least, is the *subduing of passion* for the five cords of sensual pleasures as a result of seeing the danger in them, not a special meditative state where you become unaware of them, and taking that to be the escape only goes to show one's lack of understanding of what the problem really is (and because of that, that "escape" is still underlied by sensuality, even if the person is not thinking about those objects at that time).

    >This goes along with another view I've heard, it is further more good to crave for this kind of pleasure. On the basis of the Buddha's reflection on not needing to fear jhana as it is not within sensuality shortly before his enlightenment. They also support this view by the fetter model saying rupa raga and arupa raga are later fetters so there is no need to worry about that until much later.

    Yes, another common misunderstanding. You cannot "crave" for jhāna in the way you can crave for objects of the 6th sense base, and whatever comes as a result of craving is by definition not jhāna. Jhāna arises when you give up craving temporarily, and that's why it takes way more development of mind than people usually think, since they take it as a "replacement" for the pleasure that they know. It's by *abandoning* all pleasure that you can think of, *including* your preconceived notions of "meditative joy", that you reach the joy and happiness of jhāna.

    It is *impossible* to be "attached" or "addicted to" the pleasure of jhāna, because it's reached by abandoning attachment and addiction.

    >Here, __with seclusion from appropriation/acquisition__ (upadhi), with the abandoning of unwholesome states, with the complete tranquillization of bodily inertia, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the first jhāna..."
    ―MN 64 

    So it's wrong to think that one can even *imagine* what rūpa and arūpa rāga refer to unless one has abandoned kāma rāga first and become an anāgāmi. All passion and desire that you can possibly recognize before that point is sensual, even if it inspires you to abandon the coarser stuff as meditation techniques do. 

    

    >And how does one come to know that object absorption is sensuality?

    Just ask yourself whether you would be annoyed if someone where to knock on your door and interrupt your meditation once you've finally achieved perfect focus on the object. With the pleasure that is truly beyond sensuality, being annoyed by even the most annoying things is impossible. Also, why is it pleasant? If it's not because you see sensual desire as a charcoal pit that you managed to escape from and thus feel immense relief (SN 35.244), it's not the pleasure born of withdrawal from sensuality, and focusing on an object precludes having the *context* of sensuality as a "charcoal pit" (or the context of anything, for that matter).

### Seeing A Body Within The Body - by Bhikkhu Anīgha

&#x200B;

>When that simultaneous relationship is seen, whether in terms of the body, feelings, mind or phenomena, it becomes inconceivable to exercise a sense of ownership over both thing[1] and thing[2], the sum of which nothing can possibly be outside of. You now see that you cannot be that center even if you wanted to, and body[1], which is clearly not yours, becomes the “center” instead. Same principle applies to the other *satipaṭṭhānas.* They render ownership redundant and inconceivable.  
>  
>This “ownership becoming inconceivable” point cannot be emphasized enough, given that it’s possible for people to think that, because they can now apparently overcome the sense of self by “applying” some practice, they therefore have right mindfulness or became *sotāpannas.* This is not it. It is entirely out of the question for the assumption of  self and its associated suffering to ever arise again if “body within  the body”, etc., has been understood—*even* if one doesn’t do any meditation for the rest of one’s life -  Bhikkhu Anīgha, [Seeing A Body Within The Body](https://www.hillsidehermitage.org/seeing-a-body-within-the-body/)

### Beings are owners of their actions

In a way it’s funny the Buddha had to mention that beings are owners of their actions since beings normally regard the aggregates as mine, but this ownership doesn’t fully apply to their actions. Or rather, their ownership applies to their actions but there’s a kind of hiding mechanism from that ownership. It’s like the example Nanavira gave of the Judge giving death penalty (I think this was the example?), but excusing it as not *really their* action, since they’re just playing the role of their job. But in doing this, they forget that they were the ones who chose the job, and very well could’ve not. So the excuse doesn’t work.

Since the Buddha had to explicitly mention to us to see we genuinely *are* owners of our actions and their results, it means we *haven’t* been owning up to the full extent and are hiding the fact of our ownership somehow. I’m wondering, what are all the ways in which ownership of actions can be hidden from? Is there *a single* particular thing at fault which leads to hiding from it?

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/17d2y6a/beings_are_owners_of_their_actions/k5wirv7/)** _2023-10-22 00:13:06_:

    >Is there *a single* particular thing at fault which leads to hiding from it?

    Yes, that's why accepting responsibility for actions is not *merely* about reflecting on the fact that one should, as if it were a matter of choice (at least the *complete* acceptance isn't). One needs to know the root of the issue, especially to take that responsibility to the point where it can give rise to the Right View.

    In a nutshell, there is one thing that if you learn how to do, you will always accept the right amount of responsibility even if you've never heard that expressio before. And that is, learning to endure ("on the right level", as we say) the mental displeasure which is the *result* of your past actions up to this point.

    That's because it is only possible to avoid responsibility by assuming that you have an external escape in any shape or form from that displeasure, which will automaticaly entail trying to use that assumed direction of escape to avoid that feeling.

    That "result" of past actions is not about some linear chain of cause-&-effect that has led you to your current *external* circumstances of being sick, poor, or something like that. The "result" is on the level of the wildness of the citta—how strongly it shies away from pain, and how fiercely it pulls towards the offers of pleasure.

    That wildness is brought about through the past choices of of greed, aversion and delusion by body, speech or mind that one has made, and it is through failing to pin that wildness down *this time around* and endure the tantrum that one committs more actions rooted in craving that bring about more results that you refuse to own up to and endure... and so on ad infinitum. That's saṁsāra, pretty much.

    When you make such choices, you're avoiding responsibility in the same way as you would when you're forced to take care of somebody else's dog that's been heavily spoiled prior to that. Given that it's "someone else's dog" and eventually you'll be rid of it (or so you assume), instead of actually trying to train it and subdue it's bad habits, you just give it a treat or let it go whenever it wants when it starts whining. 

    But the problem is, the dog is entirely yours, literally more than anything in the world you're have affection for, to the point where you will never be able to break away from it no matter how hard you try. Even death itself will not make you part ways.

    And, to be a broken record, seeing the signs of the mind through the Gradual Training is the first step towards "training the dog". Before that, you haven't even discerned what exactly its wild behavioral patterns are, and will just be blindly wrestling against the secondary pain that's already the *byproduct* of those patterns—potentially pissing off the dog even more while it's still not properly tied onto the leash.

### A Common Misconception about Equanimity

>Bhante what about gross things like poop or puke? I can't imagine it's really possible someone doesn't quiver when they see it and smell the nastiness.

This is actually not relevant and it's quite a prevalent wrong view, based on a misconception of what equanimity is (denial of the reactions of the senses), and confusing the "first arrow" (SN 36.6) to be the second. It reveals people's identification with their senses and failure to recognize the signs of the mind when they think their citta is equanimous because their body doesn't react in certain ways anymore. Like the idea that because someone doesn't flinch during self-immolation, they must be an Arahant.

True equanimity is being *internally undisturbed* when the senses react to things, be it strongly or weakly. That's the message behind SN 35.228 of "withstanding the force of the waves" and AN 6.55, which says the Arahant's mind is unmoved like a mountain *despite* the force of a violent rainstorm. Not that "there is no rainstorm anymore", which is possible only when one sheltering oneself from things. 

When the famous SN 36.6 ([see HH video on it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkwYOroXqK0&t=4)) talks about "bodily feeling", the first arrow, it's often implicitly interpreted as "bodily sensations" (because it's not uncommon to think vedanā means "sensation"). But all feeling is mental, even the bodily one, and goes as deep as where your moods are (the Sutta itself says there is "bodily feeling" in regard to the intellect). Seeing or remembering a close friend dying,  being diagnosed with a painless terminal cancer [and smelling disgusting things] are bodily feelings that are unpleasant even for an Arahant, but there is no resistance of their citta to it and thus no second arrow. The first arrow is in Māra's control, and by hoping to control it, one is in turn still controlled by him.

### Doing Nothing or Contemplating

This is a question I had asked Bhante Anigha, and Bhante has advised to make a seperate thread for it, so here it is!

 My confusion has to do with whether what Ajahn Nyanamoli means by "not doing anything" has to do with literally not thinking any thoughts that arise, or whether we should actually be making an effort to contemplate and think in this period? 

I always thought what Ajahn Nyanamoli had meant by doing nothing/non-activity is that one should sit and allow thoughts to come up but not engage with or think any of them, regardless of their nature as wholesome or unwhesome. 

"Just allow your mind to come up with ideas and things to do, and then don't commit to them. Let those thoughts endure and just sit about". - The Only Way to Jhana

Contemplating still seems to be doing something - actively thinking - rather than allowing thoughts to endure and not thinking any of them at all? 

Which of these should I be doing? Actively contemplating, or not thinking any thoughts that arise and endure? The thing that Ajahn describes in The Only way to Jhana seems to be to have the benefit of increasing to one's ability to endure unpleasant thoughts and emotions, but the downside is that you are not engaging with any arising thoughts at all, as opposed to not engaging only with thoughts of an unwholesome nature, but cultivating those thoughts not of an unwholesome nature (like you would do through contemplation). 

The Ajahn Chah quote below is something that shows a bit of what I mean by actively contemplating and cultivating arisen thoughts of a wholesome nature. 

"Different phenomena may contact the senses, or thoughts may arise. This is called initial thought (vitakka). The mind brings up some idea . . . Once the mind has brought it up, the mind will want to get involved and merge with it. If it's an object that is wholesome, let the mind take it up. If it is something unwholesome, stop it immediately." - Ajahn Chah, Monastery of Confusion

Sorry for the long question and any difficulties reading my phrasing, it was a bit challenging for me to reword my reply as a seperate question.

Thank you !

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/17be6s2/doing_nothing_or_contemplating/k5mf52c/)** _2023-10-20 00:20:11_:

    The answer to the confusion you have is simple: you are not truly "just allowing thoughts to come up" unless you have actively clarified the right context beforehand, because it's not a matter of choice. That "allowing" is possible only when the mind has been tamed to the necessary degree through the right context. (See SN 35.246 & MN 20).

    Instead, what you would need to do to *eventually* allow thoughts to endure is to understand (not just intellectually but concretely in your experience) what the expression "non-activity" is actually pointing to, as an example. This means seeing what the unwholesome activities that you are responsible for is and abandoning them, and that's done by seeing the sign of the mind, and right contemplations gradually point in that direction. 

    Otherwise, your attempt at "non-activity" will be about denying something that doesn't need to be denied and is not unwholesome, such as volition in regard to your thoughts.

    The problem is that usually when people try to "actively contemplate", they're just rehearsing ideas with restlessness and doubt, and when they start "just allowing things to endure", they're denying their volition and degree of real control (practicing "no-self" as opposed to "not-self"). 

    So true non-activity can only be present if you have learned how to contemplate correctly *without* falling off of the endurance of thoughts and trying to get rid of things, and learned how to endure thoughts rightly *without* losing the clarity of context which will mean you're not actually enduring them. 

    
    >"Just allow your mind to come up with ideas and things to do, and then don't commit to them. Let those thoughts endure and just sit about"

    In other words, this in itself is a contemplation, because you also need to be doing the work of clarifying what "let thoughts endure even" means (even this is not really understood by a puthujjana), not just sit back passively. The clarity of what "non-activity" is is in itself a wholesome thought that you're cultivating. Wholesome and unwholesome is not about what *objects* arise, but about clarity and lack of clarity about the true nature of things.

    One who abides in non-activity is still perfectly able to choose what to think and what not to think, recall memories, think about the future, contemplate the teachings, decide to stand up, walk or sit down, etc. (AN 3.64). What defines the non-activity is that there is full clarity on the peripheral level which remains steady *on its own* amidst the movement of thinking, volition and choice (even a very coarse choice to "actively contemplate" this or that) and that the mind is unmoved even when thinking about the most alluring or aversive things.

    
    [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9voIhZij5Io) and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBiB0W7U6FQ) explain the kind of contemplation would contribute to seeing what activities actually need to be abandoned. My [essay](https://www.hillsidehermitage.org/sila-is-samadhi/) also presents a similar line of inquiry while simultaneously highlighting the need not to misuse that inquiry to try to get rid of any arisen phenomena.

    Edit: And just to be clear, when I say "the mind is unmoved even when thinking about the most alluring or aversive things", I really mean that you're not holding anything back. You throw pure "gasoline" at the mind (the same things that would previously agitate it), and there is no possibility of a fire. This is the simile of the battle elephant in MN 125, who doesn't flinch even when threatened by spears on all sides. It's not because you're being gentle with the provocations.

    So that's the true "allowing thoughts to endure" (samatha) that one is training towards, because that's what can give rise to a mind that doesn't quiver in the face of anything, including death. One can't assume that one is already succeeding in that "allowing" before that point.

### Collection of Q/A type comments on the HH channel

I have greatly learned and cleared some of my misunderstandings from the comments section of HH videos especially when someone from HH replies to the comments. I thought it would be good to have a collection of all such Q/A kind of comments.

[Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P8pzs2XX4xBXdOJT5wtC0FkjLIxXUg5X/view) is an easy to read document for the same.

Hope this helps and please let me know if there are any issues with this or anything else.

    This is quite useful, since those comments get buried up and forgotten. I'll show it to Ajahn Nyanamoli so perhaps he'll publish it too.

    Is it possible to compile the new comments from there onwards in intervals of time as well?

### Please me identify that state I keep going in.

Hi everyone,  
I have a question but some context first. I'm a tibetan translator, been meditating for 2 decade or so but mostly in the Theravadan traditions. I recently found Ajahn Nanamoli and Hillside Hermitage  and immediately tried to understand and implement his teachings.  
Since then, I've been trying to pay more heed to peripheral awareness and stay mindful in my daily life but something unusual is happening. Since a few days it seems I can trigger some kind of awareness watching state that I know nothing about. Basically, while I'm talking I'm able to observe myself talking, it feels that "I" is the one watching. What is strange is that when I speak I don't know who is speaking or how those words are coming out as I'm not in charge and I can't see myself thinking before words come out. What's weird is that this watcher that I feel is me is kinda empty because I don't choose/think the words coming out yet they come out. By the way, I'm a translator and I'm able to trigger this state while translating which normally requires a fairly high mental work. At times I'm also able to watch myself thinking. To trigger this state requires next to no effort, it's like switching a switch. It does not feel bad, it's just that this watching consciousness feels totally empty yet stuff/words are coming out of it ??  I wonder what is this ? I mean, should I try to cultivate that state.awareness or is it totally useless and should be discarded ? What is that state/ability ?  
Thanks to all and sorry for my poor attempt at describing it.

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/17altj1/please_me_identify_that_state_i_keep_going_in/k5dwlku/)** _2023-10-18 10:57:54_:

    This is the sort of thing one would tend to wrongly emphasize when there's still a remnant of a view that insight into the Dhamma is defined by some sort of "experience", or that it's an "altered mode of perception" that you just tap into, just without the aid of psychoactive drugs.

    If it were to be relevant to the path in any way, you would need to for instance see a crystal clear connection to the *inability* to act out of sensual desire (even if you wanted to) in the future as well, when you're not abiding in that state. This is what the  "states of awareness" the Buddha taught necessarily lead to (which is the sole reason he taught them), as opposed to just providing you with something that's more captivating than sense indulgence at the time. Besides, I'm sure tons of people achieve special states of awareness "empty of I", or so they think, during sexual intercourse and similar, proving that it's not even right mindfulness/samādhi/liberation which hinge fully on right intention and right effort.

    And if you were anywhere in the neighborhood of the right type of "states", or at least got a sense of how to direct the mind so as to develop them, you would also be equally clear about the sheer amount of work you've had to put in to dry your mind out from sensual desires and craving way beforehand, often involving quite a bit of internal turmoil in that *long* process, as opposed to them arising from some shift of attention that you suddenly discovered.

    You would be immensely closer to finding the way out of the sense of "I" by sincerely questioning why you regard this as special in the first place, because the "I" is where *background passion for, interest in, and enchantment with anything*, no matter how "spiritual", is. Understanding The Way out of any such passion whatsoever (which is essentially the Right View) is how the right type of "states",i.e. Right samādhi and Arahantship, eventually can be *developed* with total deliberation by means of that blueprint, instead of experienced by chance.

### Sampajāno=Alert!!!

Sampajañña is big word in other tradition. whereas here  Satima is big word. and discussed in immense detail. However I could not find any video, where Sampajāno is discussed in detail.

is it that simple , Sampajāno =alert!!!!

HH usually  warn again  practice of observing,focusing, attending etc. but never mentioned that attending or observing is same as  sampajānakārī.   or  is there any value addition of being alert  on what you attend.

&#x200B;

Also when he says discern. does it mean anupassana?. like kayanupassana= discernment of kaya.

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/17ai3wn/sampajānoalert/k5h69xy/)** _2023-10-18 23:52:32_:

    >Sampajañña is big word in other tradition. whereas here  Satima is big word. and discussed in immense detail. However I could not find any video, where Sampajāno is discussed in detail.

    Practically speaking, these are not two different things as overly methodical traditions/approaches might present them. Rather,  both sati and sampajaññā are necessarily present when one with Right View engages in Right Effort. So the aim must be to acquire that first, making sure not to think that one's current sati and sampajaññā are right even if it all makes sense in theory.

    >HH usually  warn again  practice of observing,focusing, attending etc. but never mentioned that attending or observing is same as  sampajānakārī.   or  is there any value addition of being alert  on what you attend.

    True, because "observing" is not sampajaññā.

    >“So too, bhikkhus, here some foolish, incompetent, unskilful bhikkhu dwells contemplating a body in the body (a feeling in feelings ... a phenomenon in phenomena) ardent, clearly comprehending, mindful, having removed covetousness and displeasure in regard to the world. While he dwells contemplating the body in the body (etc.) his mind does not become concentrated, his corruptions are not abandoned, he does not pick up that hint.

    >That foolish, incompetent, unskilful bhikkhu does not gain pleasant dwellings in this very life, nor does he gain  mindfulness and clear comprehension __(satisampajaññā)__ For what reason? __Because, bhikkhus, that foolish, incompetent, unskilful bhikkhu does not pick up the hint of his own mind."__
    —SN 47.8

    In other words, you can try to be as "alert" as you possibly can, registering every single tiny movement your body makes, not slipping for a second, and yet still there will be no sati or sampajaññā. That practice will actually be going in the opposite direction, because you can't be seeing the peripheral attitudes your mind exhibits *and* at the same time be intentionally focusing on particular objects that are way coarser.

    And note how this whole Sutta points out that the unskilled monk's practice is insufficient *simply* because he doesn't take the hint of his mind. It doesn't say that his effort in terms of the 4 satipaṭṭhānas is wrong, so he is already at least trying to reflect and look at the background of his situation instead of irrelevant details. So if one takes the effort to be about focusing and observing, one ends up even worse than that unskilled monk.

    
    >Also when he says discern. does it mean anupassana?. like kayanupassana= discernment of kaya.

    Not quite. Anupassana is more like "contemplation", which means it's not necessarily accurate (as will be the case before the Right View). "Discernment" (which you could even argue is equivalent to sampajaññā) is there only when the contemplation is right, i.e. when one takes the hint of the mind, as the Sutta says.

    And, just to emphasize, the cittanimitta and the Right View are intimately linked, so this Sutta also heftily reinforces the point that to do any mindfulness practice correctly, Right View must be present.

### How is the mind trainable when it is not in my control?

So Ajahn has been teaching about training the mind as the goal of the gradual training. But if really the mind is not in my control i.e. it is of the Mara's domain - is it really trainable? I mean it is but where am I wrong in this reasoning. Can't Mara keep my mind "wild" as in the simile of wild animals? Thanks.

(I am sorry if this seems a hypothetical question but just wanted to put it here. Let me know if this question is of the "unanswerable" or similar kind where the basis is wrong.)

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/17909gs/how_is_the_mind_trainable_when_it_is_not_in_my/k569pgr/)** _2023-10-16 21:39:03_:

    >Can't Mara keep my mind "wild" as in the simile of wild animals? Thanks.

    No, that's actually the whole point we try to emphasize in various ways (with the whole "right endurance" especially).

    Māra has control of your *senses* (which includes the sixth, *mano*), but you and your past actions are solely responsible for your *citta*, and that's where Dukkha is rooted. That's why freedom from it is possible in the first place.

    >The eye is mine, ascetic, forms are mine, and the base where eye-pressure is cognized is mine.
    Where can you go, ascetic, to escape from me? The ear is mine, ascetic, sounds are mine … The nose is mine, ascetic, odours are mine … The tongue is mine, ascetic, tastes are mine … The body is mine, ascetic, tactile objects are mine … The mind (*mano*) is mine, ascetic, mental phenomena are mine, and the base where mental-pressure is cognized  is mine. Where can you go, ascetic, to escape from me?"
    —SN 4.9

    >Venerable sir, it is said, ‘Māra, Māra.’ In what way, venerable sir, might there be Māra or the description of Māra?”

    >“Where there is the eye, Samiddhi, where there are forms,  eye-consciousness, things to be cognized by eye-consciousness, there Māra exists or the description of Māra.

    >"Where there is the ear … the mind, where there are mental phenomena, mind-consciousness, things to be cognized by mind-consciousness, there Māra exists or the description of Māra.

    >“Where there is no eye, Samiddhi, no forms, no eye-consciousness, no things to be cognized by eye-consciousness, there Māra does not exist nor any description of Māra.

    >"Where there is no ear … no mind, no mental phenomena, no mind-consciousness, no things to be cognized by mind-consciousness, there Māra does not exist nor any description of Māra.”
    —SN 35.65

    And, to put it concisely "the place where Māra does not exist" is not a mystical realm that results from a meditation experience; it's the complete dispassion that results from understanding the nature of the six senses, recognizing that even the pressure they exert is not in one's control, but one's craving in regard to it can be *indirectly* abandoned (i.e. "tamed").

    The issue is of course that the whole reason why a person remains without the Right View is that they don't see that which must be "tamed", since they're used to recognizing only the things they can *look at*, which is necessarily going to be within Māra's domain, not the attitude in regard to it which is the *citta*. Even when they try to practice dispassion, this is what happens:

    >“Herein, what are the six kinds of equanimity based on the household life? On seeing a form with the eye ... on cognizing phenomenon with the mind (mano) equanimity arises in a foolish infatuated ordinary person, in an untaught ordinary person who has not conquered the boundary __[of the six senses]__ or conquered the results of actions and who is blind to danger. Such equanimity as this does not transcend the form ... mental phenomenon; that is why it is called equanimity based on the household life.
    —MN 137

    In other words, they can only make their *6 senses that belong to Māra* equanimous, but the *citta* remains on a subtler level untamed and liable to do whatever "it" wants (i.e. peripherally harbor greed, aversion and delusion) once they stop suppressing the sense domain, which is why the equanimity is fleeting and not fundamental. This is what pretty much any meditation technique or focusing practice gives you.

    Instead, by unwaveringly committing to virtue, sense restraint and watchfulness of intentions behind everything including your restraint—there is no way to just "figure out" the citta correctly by reflecting on it—it becomes clear that despite your 6 senses having their own tendencies to "pull" towards pleasure and away from pain, your *citta* does not need to be partaking in that (and you begin that "disconnect" in it's most basic form by none other than not acting out of desires).

    Once the *citta* is completely dispassionate towards the six senses as a result of the Gradual Training, you can't say that they are "pulling" anything anymore, no matter what Māra does with them. They can pull and cause dukkha only when there is a suitable basis of resistance to pressure in the *citta*.

    >“Bhikkhus, the uninstructed worldling speaks of ‘the ocean, the ocean.’ But that is not the ocean in the Noble One’s Discipline; that is only a great mass of water, a great expanse of water.

    >“The eye (ear... nose... tongue... body... mind), bhikkhus, is the ocean for a person; its current consists of forms (sounds... smells... tastes... touches... mental phenomena).One who __withstands__ that current consisting of forms (...etc.) is said to have crossed the ocean of the eye (...etc.) with its waves, whirlpools, sharks, and demons. Crossed over, gone beyond, the brahmin stands on high ground.
    —SN 35.228

### What is the best way for me to familiarize myself with the Nikayas?

I had asked Ven. Anigha this question in one of the threads, but it was far too deep in the thread and so I've created another thread for this question upon Bhante's request. I'd appreciate anyone's advice.

I've only read MN "properly", and I barely remember the content from the MN because there are so many suttas and they're so long. I usually just research suttas based on a topic that I'm currently contemplating and MN and SN are usually more than enough for that. I've never tried to do any systematic reading of SN because there are just so many suttas to read from I don't know where to start and the same with AN. For DN, this is probably the one Nikaya that I've neglected the most because I the others were more than enough.

Even when I pick a topic I want to research, it's so hard to find the relevant suttas for those topics. Any strategy for familiarizing myself with them would be appreciated.

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/177tg1p/what_is_the_best_way_for_me_to_familiarize_myself/k4ww3ks/)** _2023-10-15 00:08:43_:

    On the one hand, one should remember that ultimately one lacks the Right View not because one hasn't read enough Suttas and/or lacks the correct interpretation of "SN 95.30", but because one's mind has not been sufficiently cleared from obstructions (acting out by word, deed and thought; lack of sense restraint).

    Having said that, more familiarity with the early texts is never a bad thing *if one doesn't forget what the goal is* and instead begins to simply collect information to fit into a neat Dhamma "system". 

    The problem with trying to get too systematic about reading them is that, ultimately, what helps one recall Suttas easily *in the way that matters* is to actually understand them, and to see what they're talking about in one's own experience. 

    The results of a systematic study that isn't paired with that understanding will not only be inadequate in the ultimate sense, but even in the mundane, sheer intellectual familiarity sense.

    Because let's say you go through the Suttas by topic: that list of topics will likely have been arranged by someone who doesn't truly understand the *meaning* of the Suttas, and would not realize that some of them are actually very poignantly yet quietly describing, say, paṭiccasamuppāda. So you won't have truly learned the Suttas by topic except superficially.

    Nevertheless, one has to start somewhere, and pretty much any study you can put in, as long as, again, it's done for the sake of furthering clarity of discernment and not intellectual satisfaction, will be better than nothing. And as understanding increases from actual practice, you will see in hindsight that those Suttas actually meant more than you could even fathom at the time, and that is then building a "mental database" of the truly useful kind.

    
    Finally, learning Pāli for those who have the time to spare is highly beneficial, because that allows one to search for Suttas by their contents. Since they tend to use specific phrases again and again, once you know how a passage about say, sense restraint, is like in Pāli, you'll be able to find *all* Suttas on sense restraint. And if you're *reading* them in Pāli to boot, you're actually remembering all those phrases as you go on, so that will allow you to look them up in the future.

    
    Personally, I have never done "systematic study". Knowing Pāli and reading everything in it, coupled with a good memory which is a useful bonus, unlocks a different level of familiarity than reading translations ever could, not to mention the inability to be silently fed someone else's views as the Buddha's words. The problem is most people can't resist the temptation to become mere Dhamma scholars on account of this.

### Disambiguating the ambiguous notion of "contemplation" in the context of practice

In one of the comments in this subreddit a few weeks ago, I believe I stated that not *all* kinds of ambiguously-defined and ambiguously-directed contemplations are beneficial. But then I asked myself: well what kind of contemplation *is* beneficial? And I've been returning back to this question on and off for the past few days but haven't been able to make any progress.

When I refer to contemplation being "ambiguously-directed" I refer to the fact that it can be directed at any topics: politics, latest fashion trends, sensuality, non-sensuality, etc. There's an infinite quantity of subjects that can be contemplated, and certainly not all are considered good in the Dhamma. It's like having a bow and arrow: aiming the arrow everywhere is NOT good; if I end up aiming it at a person I will end up in a jail. So how to *decide* where to "direct" the arrow? Suppose I say I want to aim it at topics relating to the Dhamma:

* What does it mean to be "owners of your actions", and how do we ensure that we don't hide from that ownership?
* What is meant by *vinnana*? What is its nature? How does seeing its nature result in liberation?
* ...

I still do not know whether doing so is good or bad because that is determined through my current framework of good and bad which is rooted in wrong view according to the suttas. There have been many talks by HH about abstract vs practical Dhamma/contemplation/understanding, so it seems the "abstractness" is another factor used to determine whether a subject is useful or not. But abstractness isn't necessarily bad is it? It seems to be bad only if it's abstract for the sake of abstraction and has no practical roots. Practicality is good because I want to see whether that abstraction I've determined applies meaningfully to result in "*qualities that lead to dispassion, to being unfettered, to shedding, to modesty, to contentment, to seclusion, to aroused persistence, to being unburdensome*" as the suttas say. I can for instance abstractly contemplate the nature of vinnana as being liable to change, but it doesn't result in any particular orientation in experience itself that may contribute to "dispassion" of any kind. On the other hand, there are times where I've been thoroughly restrained and secluded and I can contemplate "all that is in front of me (the six senses) is dependent upon the body: is it possible for this 'all' to change? does its change have anything to do with my wish?" and immediately the "orientation" of the experience gets disturbed as its autonomous and independent nature is *revealed* and no longer points to 'me' as that too is equally liable to change; for a few minutes any pressure of whatever kind, physical or mental, ceases in its appearance.

There's quite clearly a distinction in *how* the contemplation takes place here: the first one was theoretical in the same way math would be, the second one was phenomenological (???). And this ambiguous difference in the *manner* of contemplation is what I refer to as "ambiguously-defined" contemplation; perhaps it should be "ambiguously-done" contemplation, but either way it refers to the *technique*. To apply this to the bow and arrow simile, the technique of holding the bow and arrow determines significantly where the arrow goes: holding it wrongly can end up hurting me myself since the string can hit me, or holding it wrongly can make the arrow go where I did not want it to be directed.

I've just *defined* the problem right now: that it is ambiguous to me from every perspective I can imagine. I have not even an ounce of clarity on this. I want to disambiguate this and have a precise notion of contemplation, is this possible? Or is this a wrong "direction" of the contemplation? Why is it wrong?

I would appreciate any insight on this problem.

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1770y5r/disambiguating_the_ambiguous_notion_of/k4t6xds/)** _2023-10-14 06:09:57_:

    >I want to disambiguate this and have a precise notion of contemplation, is this possible?

    Practically speaking, the attempt to "disambiguate" it too much will result in it becoming theoretical, *even* if it makes perfect sense and is guided by phenomenology and the Suttas. However, this is not at all to say the right practice is somehow "indescribable and beyond words words", which is mysticism.

    "Theoretical" simply means that it's leaving the sense of self out of the picture, and this can happen no matter what you contemplate. Otherwise, somebody *telling you* the exact theme to contemplate would result in enlightenment automatically (which the extreme of rationalism as opposed to the mysticism of an esoteric  meditation experience). What gives rise to wisdom is not the subject of the contemplation itself, but rather being able to see the "level" where contemplation applies. Without seeing that level, the sense of self remains unpervaded by the contemplation, which means no true dispassion, even if you contemplate death itself and the utter destruction of everything that's dear to you with the utmost urgency.

    On the other hand, you may have not read a single word from the Suttas or even heard the word mind or consciousness, but if you see that what makes up your body is fundamentally not different from stones, leaves, and branches, and you are, first and foremost, discerning the body as a general phenomenon and not an object of perception, *and*, furthermore, also seeing that the things you hold dearly depend upon it, including your sense of self, then that "basic" contemplation will give rise to total dispassion.

    So it's about learning how to "trap" your sense of self into whatever you're contemplating. If you fail to do so, then, whether you recognize it or not and regardless of your views, the sense of self is the one contemplating at that moment, and thus craving is at work.

    You won't be able to get this perfectly right in the beginning, but this is exactly where virtue and restraint comes in. When your mind is throwing a tantrum on account of not giving it the things it wants, that's the perfect opportunity to start "trapping it" within your contemplation, because it's "movements" get highlighted. People often think restraint is for the sake of suppressing those movements and reaching the peace of an "empty mind", but that's not the case. It's to *reveal* the movements even more.

    Moreover, when you've been acting out of things, engaging with needless company, distractions, etc., your discernment and skill in contemplation will need to be manifold times sharper to be able to re-establish an accurate picture, and all your attempts will likely be theoretical even if you bring back all your past insights.

    And this is why an ordinary person needs to be manifold times more unforgiving with their restraint, while the one with the Right View and beyond can afford to drop the practice and *seemingly* get careless (as that layman Sarakāni who was drinking alcohol in the Suttas), but would be able to pick the right level of contemplation back up in a fingersnap as if nothing happened.

    That ability is also what makes the grasping at virtue and practices completely redundant, because one realizes that sitting cross legged 2 hours a day or any routine actions whatsoever one might assume are indispensable, do not magically contribute to having the right level to contemplate upon. Sure, certain habits of *abstinence* need to be in place well beforehand, but that in itself does not guarantee seeing the right level of contemplation.

    Rather, seeing the right level to contemplate on guarantees seeing the right level to contemplate on.

### body within body !!!

I asked youtube but did not get answer.. Lets see  if someone here can help me.(I am sorry for very basic question..)

when you say body within body.. what is container body? and what body it contains? 

do you mean the contained body is the separate self or ego/panca-upadan-khanda. in other word see the self is contained by this physicial body.?

In other words the nama-kaya( mind) is contained in rupa-kaya( physical body)?

\-----

I asked this question 2 month back on  old video titled " Four Foundations of Mindfulness to Enter Jhana ".  which was based on MN125.Today I was again going thr latest video " The Mind Whisperer" also based on MN 125.

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/176rj53/body_within_body/k4pna59/)** _2023-10-13 14:42:11_:

    "Body[1] within body[2]" means that you learn to see your entire experience,  the six senses and their objects, as a body[2] that is secondary, less relevant, on the "surface" of body[1]. "Within" means just that: body[1] sits at the "center" of body[2], and thus is more fundamental.

    Body[1] can be anything that is a simultaneous foundation for the body that you see, use, and are attached to. It's the material things that your body[2] relies on to exist, such as your organs, the 4 elements, your breathing, and mere material form that is no more special than that of a corpse.

    By repeatedly seeing that simultaneous *relationship* correctly— not by focusing on one thing alone, which would only sustain the sense of __me__ being at the core of the experience and looking at it—you eventually become unable to exercise any passion and ownership over *both* body[1] and body[2], which together constitute your entire life. You now see that you cannot possibly be that center even if you want to, and body[1], which is clearly impermanent, becomes the center instead. Same principle applies to the other satipaṭṭhānas.

    The well-known "in the seen just the seen" utilizes the same imagery of something being "inside". One learns to see that that "center", where the notion of self gets established, is nothing more than subtler phenomena that pertain to and thus depend on what is seen, namely less palpable thoughts, intentions, feelings, notions,  memories, etc. If you actually discern that that "center" is a *thing*, just much subtler than the sights are, you can no longer take it as your self. "In the seen just the seen" has nothing to do with the fallacious idea of "bare perceptions".

    But the caveat to all this is that, unless a person has the Right View, they cannot actually see this principle on the right level (because if they did, the view of self wouldn't be there still—it can't survive when those two things are seen simultaneously). So one must remember that whatever one is contemplating is still on the level of theory until that point, and not think that one already understood right mindfulness.

    Lastly, what allows one to get the Right View and see those two levels is seeing the "hint" of the mind (cittanimitta we often talk about), and for that hint to be grasped, one needs to have been living restrained from sensuality and not delighting in the company of others for a long time. Unrestrained actions ("me here" seeking the pleasant objects "out there") and company ("me here" and other people "out there") automatically abolish perspective and thus reinforce that wrong "center".

    >Bhikkhus, (1) it is impossible that a bhikkhu who delights in company, who is delighted with company, who is devoted to delight in company; who delights in a group, who is delighted with a group, who is devoted to delight in a group, will find delight in solitude when he is alone. (2) It is impossible that one who does not find delight in solitude when he is alone will acquire the hint of the mind. (3) It is impossible that one who does not acquire the hint of the mind will fulfill the Right View. (4) It is impossible that one who does not fulfill the Right View will fulfill Right Composure. (5) It is impossible that one who does not fulfill Right Composure will abandon the fetters. (6) Without having abandoned the fetters, it is impossible that one will realize Nibbāna.
    —AN 6.68

### How Gradual Traning, Not Focusing, Leads to A Calm Mind

**r/HillsideHermitage** | Posted by phueh _2023-10-09 23:24:46_
### Has Ven Nyanamoli talked about the anapanasati sutra, right mindfulness and right concentration?

I find his talks advanced and a bit tough to follow.  It’s my fault, I just find it like trying to learn quantum mechanics from listening to a fast conversation between two people who are already experts in quantum mechanics.

But I have read his two books and I like most of what he says.  But he says focusing meditations are not what I’m supposed to be doing.

Instead I should be trying to get right view, or just sit and endure sitting there without doing anything in the present moment.  I know I’m butchering his instructions, but you get what I’m talking about - I’m not supposed to sit there and focus on my breath or whatever.

But unless I’m misinterpreting his definition of “focusing meditation”, didn’t the Buddha teach being in the present moment with right mindfulness and right effort, and being aware of the breath in a one pointed way, and doing that all the way to jhana?  Isn’t that how the Buddha himself reached enlightenment?

Am I missing something obvious here?  Thanks very much for your insights.

Sorry, autocorrect changed ‘sutra’ to sutra in the title.

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1746b0u/has_ven_nyanamoli_talked_about_the_anapanasati/k496667/)** _2023-10-10 10:05:40_:

    >didn’t the Buddha teach being in the present moment with right mindfulness and right effort, and being aware of the breath in a one pointed way, and doing that all the way to jhana?  Isn’t that how the Buddha himself reached enlightenment?

    In brief, no, he did not, assuming we agree that the Suttas are the only reliable guide and put aside the Commentarial notions that have seeped into contemporary views of meditation.

    Hypothetically, if you took somebody who has never heard a word about Buddhism or meditation at all and made them go through the early texts, they would 100% not end up with the idea that the Buddha taught one pointed focusing on one's breath (which is not what Anapanasati is). They would instead conclude that the Buddha mainly taught *contempation* of wholesome and unwholesome phenomena, and that samatha and jhānas are a result of that. 

    They would also realize that Anapanasati cannot possibly be something *completely different* than that right reflection and thinking which he taught 99% of the time, so they would interpret the meagre amount of occurrences Anapanasati in light of that other 99%, instead of the other way around as it is today. Anapanasati, although highly praised by the Buddha in only a handful of Suttas, is nowhere near a frequent mention, which is vastly incongruent with how many people today cannot conceive of "meditation" that does not involve the breath.

    In fact, there is evidence to think that the Buddha only intended Anapanasati for advanced practitioners (i.e. with the Right View), given the assembly of exclusively Noble Ones that received the Anapanasati Sutta, and the fact that he discouraged his own son from doing Anapanasati before he was ready, in MN 62. And what you most certainly won't find anywhere is an instance of him instructing laypeople (i.e. non-renunciates) on Anapanasati as it's done today.

    Furthermore, the  "meditation" for abandoning the hindrances and entering jhāna that recurs all over the Suttas, unlike Anapanasati that is extremely rare in comparison and doesn't occur in explicit connection to jhāna, is *contemplating and reflecting* on the dangers of sensual desire and unwholesome states.

    "One-pointedness" for ekaggatā and "absorption" for jhāna are also completely inaccurate renderings, and thus ideas too. These have become ingrained due to to translators and Buddhist teachers reverse-engineering the Dhamma— by means of the views of what jhāna/meditation was *already* assumed to be in times when nobody acknowledged that the Commentaries don't agree with the Suttas. And most of them continue to spread those ideas even now, despite often labeling themselves as early Buddhists who reject later interpretations.

    "Agga" (from eka-agga, "one point") never actually means "point" in *any* context in Pāli. It means "tip; peak" or even "place". And "jhāna" (from the Pāli *jhāyati*) actually means "[1. to meditate, think upon, contemplate](https://obo.genaud.net/backmatter/glossology/pali_roots.htm#Jh)". Plus, the English word "meditation" itself had nothing to do with one-pointed focusing 2 centuries ago, before Buddhism (*of the Commentaries*) made its way into the West. The latin word from which "meditation" is derived means "to think or reflect upon, consider, design, purpose, intend", not "observe physical sensations exclusively until you lose all reflective awareness".

    Thus, when the Buddha told monks "Monks, meditate (do-jhāna), do not be negligent!", as he frequently did, he was literally talking about *contemplating rightly*, which is what results in Right Samādhi when there is Right View (see DN 2, MN 19, MN 20, MN 39, MN 106, SN 35.246... the list goes on.)

    So, technically, you don't need to sit down and literally "do nothing" the whole time. If you want to "meditate" even if you don't have the Right View yet, you simply do precisely what that word actually means, and which the Buddha instructed innumerable times: 

    >Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu resorts to a secluded resting place: the forest, the root of a tree, a mountain, a ravine, a hillside cave, a charnel ground, a jungle thicket, an open space, a heap of straw.

    >“On returning from his almsround, after his meal he sits down, folding his legs crosswise, setting his body erect and establishing mindfulness before him. Abandoning covetousness for the world, he abides with a mind free from covetousness; he purifies his mind from covetousness. Abandoning ill will and hatred, he abides with a mind free from ill will, compassionate for the welfare of all living beings...
    —MN 39

    And how does he do this?

    >...bhikkhus, a noble disciple __considers__ thus: ‘Sensual pleasures here and now and sensual pleasures in lives to come, sensual perceptions here and now and sensual perceptions in lives to come—both alike are Māra’s realm, Māra’s domain, Māra’s bait, Māra’s hunting ground. On account of them, these evil unwholesome mental states such as covetousness, ill will, and aggression arise, and they constitute an obstruction to a noble disciple in training here. Suppose I were to abide with a mind abundant and exalted, having transcended the world and made a firm determination with the mind. When I do so, there will be no more evil unwholesome mental states such as covetousness, ill will, and presumption in me, and with the abandoning of them my mind will be unlimited, immeasurable, and well developed.’ When he practises in this way and frequently abides thus, his mind acquires confidence in this base. Once there is full confidence, he either attains to the imperturbable __(=up to the fourth jhāna or the dimension of infinite space)__.
    —MN 106

    *(incidentally, synonymous language permeates the entire Anapanasati instruction—"he __understands/discerns/reflects upon/considers__ his breathing in this way and that way", not "he focuses on its (irrelevant) sensations").

    
    And the catch is, you *need* to have purified your behavior and livelihood from those same unwholesome things for these contemplations to yield any significant result, because otherwise your considering of sensuality as a trap is not genuine, evidenced by the fact that you still go and pursue it when you're not meditating. Hence the necessity of virtue, celibacy and gradual training that we often emphasize.

    This [essay](https://www.hillsidehermitage.org/sila-is-samadhi/) goes into further detail on the type of contemplation that can result in the samādhi that the Suttas portray.
    - **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1746b0u/has_ven_nyanamoli_talked_about_the_anapanasati/k49ss4f/)** _2023-10-10 13:34:08_:

        One additional remark I didn't include:
        Note that MN 106 quoted above goes all the way up to the *base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception*, and this is probably the only Sutta where the Buddha gives explicit instructions on how to reach the formless states. And in every single case, this hypothetical monk—who nobody can deny is doing full-on samatha—does so by frequently __considering/reflecting__ on the right themes until the mind is confident in them.

        What is then to be said of someone who, under the pretext of samatha, wants to *deactivate* their capacity to reflect upon anything by focusing on tactile sensations of breathing and thus suppposedly reach the first jhāna.

### Daily Routine

What would be the ideal daily routine for someone on a holiday with a whole month to devote themselves to the practice of Dhamma, while adhering to the precepts, practicing restraint, and maintaining moderation in eating, according to Bhikkhu Nyanamoli's teachings? How can one structure their day to get the right view and make the most of this extended period of Dhamma practice?

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/170jti5/daily_routine/k3ps4vo/)** _2023-10-06 13:49:31_:

    Having a routine or not is not what determines one success. If a person has the tendency to procrastinate, not do things they know they should do or get easily distracted, then establishing a routine could be useful. But if that's not the case, then the desire for a routine could be a sign of an achievement-oriented mindset that's not in line with how progress in the Dhamma actually works.

    Development in the Dhamma is measured by how much one is incapable of suffering amidst suffering, and that criterion, or what that even means, is inherently not seen by one without the Right View. 

    Thus, the measurable results that such a person  could be hoping for at the end of their adherence to a schedule will necessarily be things that don't pertain to the ultimate goal,  such as intellectual familiarity with the teaching, or the more "palpable" yet mundane return on investment that is obtained from wrong meditation. It is already too easy to confuse these things with real understanding, and not challenging the assumptions behind one's insistence on a routine can make that mistake even more likely.

### How do 'Choiceless Awareness,' 'Open Awareness,' and 'Do Nothing' align with Nyanamoli's Mindfulness Approach to Peripheral Awareness?

Hello everyone, I'm seeking some insights.

When Nyanamoli discusses the correct approach to maintaining our mental state—avoiding excessive focus (absorption) while retaining peripheral or contextual awareness— which mindfulness practices or teachers, such as 'choiceless awareness,' 'open awareness,' or 'do nothing,' closely align with Nyanamoli's concept of peripheral awareness? I'm in search of an alternative explanation of Nyanamoli's idea to gain a better understanding, specifically only in the context of establishing mindfulness.

Thanks!

&#x200B;

EDIT:  

Perhaps I have expressed myself in a confusing manner. I am not referring to comparing the entire practice of "choiceless awareness" or "do nothing" or any other practice with Nyanamoli's peripheral awareness/contextual awareness. Rather, I am referring to whether the way peripheral awareness is explained is similar to that of other teachers who use different terminology, regardless of what you do with what you are aware of during meditation; that would not be the subject of comparison in this case.

For example, on the contrary, imagine a teacher who asserts that attention should be very focused on the object and seek absorption. An example of this would be to say that Pa-Auk understands mindfulness in the same way as this imaginary teacher.

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/16yjuh1/how_do_choiceless_awareness_open_awareness_and_do/k3dx24w/)** _2023-10-04 04:13:06_:

    It would be misleading to draw comparisons based on the technicalities of how the practice of mindfulness is explained, because there's nothing in that which inherently guarantees that the relevant approach will be in line with the Dhamma. Such technicalities are secondary.

    To illustrate, someone could easily extract a "system" from HH teachings that would in the letter be very similar to what some "choiceless awareness" teacher says, who also happens to encourage that same awareness during sexual intercourse, for instance, as opposed to presenting that as antithetical to the development of right awareness (which is made "right" by none other than the abandonment of unwholesome as its foundation).

    On the other hand, there could hypothetically be a teacher who does not speak in terms of peripheral awareness or of "how to meditate" at all, but who insists on complete renunciation and abandonment of the world *without* resorting to absorption into trance states (which precludes abandoning anything relevant), and that would actually be much closer to the meditation Ajahn Nyanamoli is teaching. The Suttas define right meditation as the surmounting of sensuality and all unwholesome states, not as a specific manner of directing your attention. 

    If it were clear to people (which it seems to have been back in the Buddha's day) that concentrating upon one thing cannot possibly constitute samādhi—but only *suppression* of those unwholesome states, which isn't samādhi—then there would be no need to give any detailed descriptions of what to do with one's awareness. Ajahn Nyanamoli does so only because of the prevalence of such misunderstandings contemporarily.

    To put it simply, Ajahn Nyanamoli's instructions are not merely an approach to peripheral awareness coupled with a greater emphasis on Right View and dispassion, and it cannot be reverse-engineered by combining those elements. The whole is more than the sum of its parts in this case.

### My shaky reasons to keep the precepts

I had been keeping the 8 precepts quite easily last month, but near the end of the month I asked myself whether I really knew how keeping the precepts would lead to the ending of suffering. And I could give an artificial reason as to how it would: acting out of the 8 precepts necessarily implies acting out of craving, and if I abstain from acting out rightly, I would be diminishing craving, which is the cause of suffering. By this reason, I would be less liable to suffering.

This felt artificial because although "craving is the cause of suffering" seems intuitively true, I haven't arrived at the truth of that for myself. Since if it were the case that I *truly* identified craving as suffering, 99% of present efforts in my life would collapse. It felt like someone else did the homework for me to arrive at the "truth". Instead of knowing the Noble Truth of Cause of Suffering, I know, and can guarantee, the equivalent Puthujjana Truth of Cause of Suffering: the World *has* suffering, and removal of *things in the World* is removal of suffering. It is of absolute certainty to me that when I'm suffering, I can, by means of interacting with the world, remove that suffering. If I have some diagnosable dental issue, I can get it fixed. Except of course when I can't, which is what happened to me and what led me to look for some internal way out of suffering when I had significant chronic pain. This kind of certainty is not present to any extent with holding the view that "craving is suffering" although it sounds intuitively true.

I never had a single strong reason for keeping the precepts, the reasons would fluctuate. Sometimes it would be because of the fact that I was suffering significantly and keeping the precepts could somehow help in removing the suffering *eventually*. Sometimes it would be for worldly reasons like removing entertainment to get work done. But the reason was never established on genuinely seeing a correlation between breaking them and harm. I now am utterly clueless regarding why I should keep the precepts since I can simply abstain from entertainment while doing work to get it done quickly, and then proceed to go back to entertainment. But after a while, I start to see some kind of fundamental dissatisfaction in all the entertainment I engage in: I hop from one thing to another thing to another thing, and there's just constant dissatisfaction on some level while doing all of this even though it feels pleasant on the surface. But this fundamental dissatisfaction doesn't seem dissatisfactory enough for me to quit entertainment. I can tell myself that I had suffered significantly before, and it was indeed quite a significant amount of suffering but it barely causes any emotional reaction now. Same is the case for future suffering, it feels artificial.

I can't find good reason anymore even though I'd really like it if I had one. I want a reason that is absolute in some sense, that I can keep regardless of my mind's moods. But I don't know if that absoluteness depends on the reason *itself* or on myself to keep that reason absolute. I went from the 8 precepts to just the 5 now since they've been the natural state for me. I would like it if I could get some help on how to proceed from this slug. It feels like I'm stuck in some kind of loophole here. What *is* a good reason to keep the precepts?

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/16wf0s3/my_shaky_reasons_to_keep_the_precepts/k2zlyx2/)** _2023-10-01 12:04:02_:

    In order for the practice to be correct in the first place, one has to be doing it without the aid of external motivations. Having an external motivation for your practice is none other than *sīlabbataparāmāsa*.

    "External" doesn't just refer to things literally out there in the world; it includes even an inspired mood that you might have one day but not the next.

    And the crux of the entire Dhamma is that the ignorant mind inherently *resists* the burden of having to say no to unwholesome things—that's the *sole problem*, which is why one is responsible for it. That's why it feels like there must be a *justification* for renunciation: you wouldn't do work that is uncomfortable unless there's a reward at the end, and this itself is the principle of gain and sensuality. 

    So the solution is not the find the perfect motivator, which will mean you're still operating in terms of sensual craving, but to stop resisting the work altogether, so that it's not uncomfortable anymore. Only then your views about sensuality can start to change; otherwise, subtler sensuality will be your motivation for abandoning coarser sensuality.

    So, counterintuitively, renunciation becomes pleasant and sustains itself *not* when that burden of responsibility to say no to things is not there anymore, but when you start finding that *same burden* pleasant. That will happen if you learn how to stop resisting it and see it for what it is. And nothing that just happens to you or that you hear from someone else will magically get you to stop resisting it in an instant. 

    >I can't find good reason anymore even though I'd really like it if I had one. I want a reason that is absolute in some sense, that I can keep regardless of my mind's moods. But I don't know if that absoluteness depends on the reason *itself* or on myself to keep that reason absolute.

    *You* keeping the reason absolute is what can eventually result in the reason that is absolute *in itself*. That's why enlightenment cannot be attained without "manly restraint, manly effort, manly determination," as the Suttas say. You can't expect it not to be *your* burden to go against the grain of your mind's moods until then. Nevertheless, that "manly effort" will not be equally unpleasant forever. You just can't know for how long.

    This is why there's always a need to keep one's trust in the practice one step ahead of one's reasoning (not *discard* one's reasoning like some would say), and endure the pain of doubt that results from that. 

    Insisting in having the reasoning first and the trust second will lead to one's practice being dependent on one's moods, because reasoning is subjective and is inherently secondary to moods, despite what rationalists would like to argue.
