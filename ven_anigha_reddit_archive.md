### Are there any things that involve peripheral awareness?

Any normal thing like a game or an activity that require peripheral awareness more than usual 

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1gchsof/are_there_any_things_that_involve_peripheral/lu0c8sh/)** _2024-10-27 14:01:55:

    There's nothing that "requires" the supramundane type of awareness that uproots the defilements, for otherwise a worldly endeavor would train you to transcend the world. It's something that can only be developed through a deliberate choice because it's about "swimming against the stream".

    As for things that are *compatible* with the effort to develop peripheral awareness: if you delight in doing something and if it involves other people, it's incompatible. So a "game" would be out of the question. If you don't particularly delight in something nor hate it, then peripheral awareness of the relevant kind could be maintained while doing it.

### Dealcoholized Beer (0.5%)

I used to enjoy drinking a dealcoholized beer here and there,  I realized that the 0.5% might be a breach of the fifth precept so I stopped due to doubt if it's a good idea. 

I know the rules are very strict when it comes to monks and alcohol(not even a drop on a blade of grass) but I'm wondering what the situation is like for laypeople.  The "that lead to intoxication" part of the precept seems most relevant here, along with my intentions of course.  I find it very refreshing, and I enjoy the taste(and it's only 10 calories). I only drink one at a time.  Drinking a cold beer in a hot shower is really relaxing, although I worry if that might be a bit too sensual.  Probably the most sensual thing I'd do. 

Not as relevant, but when I was conflicted about this before(unrelated to the alcohol content issue) I had a dream Ajahn Chah told it was fine to drink them. Drinking one in the afternoon/evening actually helped me get over my strong attachment to hot cocoa and chocolate, which was an endless craving for me(a consequence of replacing the evening meal with a piece of chocolate or cocoa when I first started taking the precept about eating times). I realize I can't do things just because dream Ajahn Chah says I can, but his advice certainly helped at the time.

Edit: It's clear that I **was** trying to justify it or look for external validation(not that I've even had a drink since I realized it may be a compromise).  Like Bhikkhu Anigha(I am deeply thankful for your guidance) says, it seems more like it's an issue of consuming for the sake of pleasure. I imagine it's difficult to give advice on this topic given my circumstances(see below) and not wanting to push me in a wrong direction.  I got worked up over my eating issues but I found some peace last night by determining "I won't die so it doesn't matter" towards food and seeing that to as an issue dependent on having a body and being attached to it.

Also, last night I dreamt I attended a debate. There were elderly people who told me this was a "beverages allowed" event and I told them I was grateful for that. They were FOR "allowing beverages" and waxed on about the history of their leadership. But then the other side showed up, the party of Ethics.  They had a very powerful presence and were very passionate about their cause and I came to favour them.

    The problem wouldn't so much be the technicality of whether the alcohol percentage makes it count as an intoxicant—it probably doesn't because apparently the body metabolizes it almost as quickly as you drink it, so getting drunk is almost impossible—but the fact that your mind seems to be keen to justify it even though it clearly serves no practical purpose. So I would see it as a failure to give up eating for the sake of pleasure (a subtler stage of the training) and not a breach of the 5th precept per se.

    >We don't need to mortify the body and deny life to be liberated, and if we are clinging to such austerity then we are in fact in the way of our liberation.

    It's quite preposterous to suggest that keeping just the eight precepts is a way of mortifying *the body*. We have been pretty clear that taking on further "austerities" than that is usually not advisable. A pretty comfortable life on the bodily level is still very much possible even as a monk keeping the entire Pātimokkha, let alone the 8 precepts.

    >This very poster said they have a tendency toward self mortification.

    And the solution is not to risk making them feel at ease with potential sensuality just because it will be less unpleasant. It's to tell them to tread carefully if they see themselves going in that direction of self-mortification, but without moving the goalpost and falling into the other extreme: the view that craving is not an obstacle to the Dhamma of non-craving, which [the Buddha severely criticized](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn22). 

    But if realizing that Dhamma for oneself is not the goal, then none of this applies. These actions are not "dangerous" in some external moralizing sense. 

    >Yet these are simple things  laypeople are worked up about in this subreddit, causing them stress. 

    That's not inherently bad. Enlightenment isn't reached by going with the flow of one's existing tendencies, and the Buddha couldn't have been clearer about that.
- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1gc630i/dealcoholized_beer_05/ltyz25r/)** _2024-10-27 06:11:47 *(in reply to a comment not included)*:

    Yes, it's all about preemptively restraining actions that would be born out of one's mental delight so that that delight can be revealed and then abandoned, because delight is the root of suffering, as the Buddha said, and acting out of delight precludes seeing delight. 

    Every aspect of the training is about revealing and restraining the unwholesome attitudes of the mind, not about toughening up the body (although that might come as a secondary bonus).

### 7th precept question

I work as a software developer.  I often read textbooks to learn new skills related to my job, and dedicate a large amount of time to go above in beyond in terms of my professional contributions and expanding my skillset.  I take it to be okay due to the phrase "accomplished in his sphere of activity" but would appreciate further insights into this matter.  Frankly, it has been difficult for me to determine whether this all falls under entertainment to some extent.  I legitimately do enjoy it. 

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1gbi3m8/7th_precept_question/ltttvfp/)** _2024-10-26 10:05:17:

    As long as you are making sure that while you are doing it, the purpose is to support your livelihood and not entertainment per se, then even if you happen to find it entertaining, it would not be an automatic breach of the precepts like listening to music, watching movies, or playing videogames would be.

    Now, that's not to say that spending a lot of time and effort in mundane endeavors even if they're not against the precepts won't detract from your efforts in the Dhamma. It will, simply because the  time and energy you have each day are limited, so you can't make optimal progress in two things at once. Hence the Buddha said that delighting in and overdoing talk, work, and sleep—none of which are against the precepts—would hinder progress even as a noble disciple.

    Nevertheless, you have much bigger "leaks" to address than this if you're still breaking other precepts from time to time.

### 6th precept

Hello, just wondering if  permanently sticking to a 8-eat  / 16-fast schedule and not snacking (ie; two meals within the window) would be within the spirit of the precept.  I have an odd sleep schedule largely related to work habits and am very physically active.  Im trying to be pragmatic here because I believe the solar noon interpretation would be very unhealthy for my body and thus unsustainable.  But I also don't want to be making a compromise, I want to actually be following the precept where it counts.

Thanks.

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1gbhzou/6th_precept/ltv8nke/)** _2024-10-26 16:01:10:

    It would be more conducive to recognizing the mental craving for pleasure and restraining it than eating whenever you want. The specific timing of the meal(s) is not necessarily essential, although 4 hours would be better than 8, and a single meal better than a time window. But you can progress towards that gradually.

    As an aside, you may also want to reconsider whether eating before noon is what's unhealthy/unnatural and not the odd sleep schedule.

### Is dealing with sloth and torpor through caffeine bad for the gradual training? 

 Hello everyone. Sloth and torpor has been the hardest hindrance for me. Once it settles in, it seems like there's nothing to be done besides waiting. 

 I've been trying to quite caffeine too, so my sloth and torpor is quite strong. Things get even worse because I have to work in a very thinking demanding job, so sometimes I feel defenseless without caffeine. 

  
 How do you deal with sloth and torpor without coffee? Is it bad to drink coffee if one is trying to practice the gradual training? 

  
 Thank you so much!

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1g9mv9f/is_dealing_with_sloth_and_torpor_through_caffeine/ltbu2cl/)** _2024-10-23 12:03:21:

    Sloth and torpor is not the fact that you're drowsy or tired. That will happen to the body at times regardless of what you do. It's the fact that you attend to that state wrongly, i.e., wallow in it, or try to get rid of it as if you were the owner of your aggregates. And that's why it makes you suffer.

    So drinking coffee is not good or bad in itself. What's bad is the view that coffee or any sort of external remedy or lifestyle change can address the hindrance of sloth and torpor. They can't; they just remove the obvious *trigger* for that hindrance. So it would be like thinking that you're free from aversion just because annoying things no longer happen to you.

### Uprooting anxiety - Beginner here 

Hello hoping to get some clarification to my understanding as I am new to this. I recently stopped trying to hide from life through the use of alcohol and am trying to learn how to live on life's terms

Anxiety is a major hindrance for me (though obviously, I suffer from all 5). I was listening to the podcast episode "Unwelcoming of the Hindrances" and it made sense that I am strengthening this hindrance by two major factors:

1) Running away/distracting myself from it - This was my primary reason for drinking/escape

2) Attaching my attention to it by obsessively worrying about my health, the future, etc. Thinking that I need to pay attention to the stories and sensations produced by this hindrance or something horrible would happen.

So these are both wrong attention and perpetuating the anxiety itself - is that accurate? To eventually uproot it, I need to learn how to let anxiety be here, do it's thing, but not try to escape it and not give it the attention it wants (or the attention I've habitually given it in the past) ?  Sort of like feel the fear and do what I need to do in life anyway? 

I would like to start practicing/experimenting with this, but I don't want to unintentionally do this wrong and feed the anxiety more so any clarification would be most welcome.

Thank you so much :)

    More accurately, don't just try to "deal" with the anxiety, with is often just one of the byproducts of the underlying problem. Look instead at what's making you *liable* to anxiety to begin with, which is bound to be passion and attachment of some sort that you still keep maintaining. When there is that which is dear, anxiety about losing it is inevitable. And by nurturing passion towards specific things, you also nurture passion towards your aggregates as a whole, so sickness, aging, and death will become even more distressing.

    Once you've stopped engaging in acts of passion that increase the liability to anxiety (i.e., are established in virtue and restraint), then yes, the rest of the work is to learn how to balance your attention while  anxiety is there (not give in to it without trying to get rid of it). 

    That last step is like heating up the water that's left in a pan until it all finally evaporates. You're not getting anywhere if you're still adding water to the pan by creating and maintaining existing cravings and attachments.

### Mind-moments

I'm listening to this discussion:

https://youtu.be/xw4d3kPrGd0?si=p3DoY7Ad_9uTPhjp

And so far have gathered that the Ajahns refute the abhidhamma and commentary claim that the mind is made up of "mind moments."

1.) Why are they refuting this? 
2.) Why do they see the Commentaries and abhidhamma as untrustworthy or inaccurate?
3.) How then should the mind be described, and what would they base that description on?

I have not finished the discussion because there is so much there that I want to listen to it in blocks so I can stop and digest what I've heard. I apologize if these questions are answered later in the video.

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1g7a0sq/mindmoments/lsv8sxq/)** _2024-10-20 17:03:39:

    It doesn't even matter whether the mind is made up of "mind moments". The problem is not that that specific idea is wrong, and we're suggesting an alternative. The entire premise that suffering is resolved by figuring out how your mind and experience "work" is in itself a very inaccurate conception of what wisdom is. It's on the same level as the pointless speculation that the Buddha denounced as a form of *ayoniso manasikāra* in MN 2:

    >This is how he attends not-through-the-origin: ‘Did I exist in the past? Did I not exist in the past? What was I in the past? How was I in the past? After being what, what did I become in the past? Will I exist in the future? Will I not exist in the future? What will I be in the future? How will I be in the future? After being what, what will I become in the future?’  **Or he is undecided about the present thus: ‘Am I? Am I not? What am I? How am I? This creature—where did it come from? And where will it go?’**

    Instead of figuring out what your mind is made of, the problem is (as MN 2 explains) how you attend to things and how that either feeds or starves your defilements. As a result of purifying your mind from greed, aversion, and delusion through virtue and sense restraint coupled with proper attention, you will get to understand *anattā* and the Four Noble Truths for yourself, and be liberated from suffering eventually. Not as a result of abstract rationalizations that you use to downplay and cover up the suffering you generate through your own actions—until that doesn't work anymore.

    >Why do they see the Commentaries and abhidhamma as untrustworthy or inaccurate?

    Because they consist either of descriptions of how to develop the opposite of mindfulness (complete absorption in one thing at the expense of everything else, depriving you of the perspective to distinguish wholesome from unwholesome) or abstract information that will make you think you understand what the Buddha meant just because you can parrot it.

### Losing Mindfulness?

How can mindfulness be lost if the very act of recognizing that loss implies its presence?   
  
An animal, for example, could be said to have legitimately lost its mindfulness of virtue since animals don't appear to have any reference point for virtuous recollection, but in contrast a human who recognizes he is breaking the precepts has not lost his mindfulness (otherwise he would not know he is breaking precepts). At most he has chosen to suppress his mindfulness to the degree required to act in that way, which indicates that the unfortunate choosing of that choice itself was rooted in mindfulness. So it doesn't seem possible to ever get outside of mindfulness once it is established, even if an entire life is lived making choices antithetical to it. This doesn't seem like a particularly skillful way to live, nor very peaceful, yet it would not seem to ever completely leave behind the mindfulness of what is wholesome.

    In a certain sense you could put it that way, but "being mindful" in itself doesn't do anything. Freedom from suffering is not attained simply through mindfulness but also through effort (another one of the basic faculties and enlightenment factors). So if a person acts in unwholesome ways, their effort is lacking, and their mindfulness too, present as it may be, clearly isn't sufficiently developed. You wouldn't walk into a pit of burning embers if you were truly mindful of it as such.

### Touched by joy and sorrow: Questioning some quotes of supposed Arahants.


I’ve heard some teachers believe that an Arahant still feels emotions including negative ones, but simply does not hold them. This has been bubbling in my mind since I heard a teacher who I best not name say that an Arahant still experiences dukkha, but that there is no self in it, that it is simply “dukkha arising and dukkha passing away.”

One anecdote of Ajahn Chah's interaction with a palm reader who read his palm and said: "You have a lot of anger!" to which Ajahn Chah replied: "Yes, but I don't use it."

Some Western monks asked Luang Por Piak about this passage. His reply was along these lines: "Luang Por Chah was very creative with his use of language, he wanted to shake people up sometimes. The mind of an arahant is totally free from defilements. What he was referring to was the results of past kamma that were still present."

Similarly:

In 1979, Luang Pu Dune went to Chantaburi to rest and to visit with Ajaan Somchai … He discussed different points of meditation practice with Luang Pu, finally asking him, "Do you still have any anger?"
Luang Pu immediately answered, "I do, but I don't pick it up."

When Luang Pu Dune was undergoing treatment at Chulalongkorn Hospital in Bangkok, large numbers of people came ... Mr. Bamrungsak Kongsuk … broached the topic of the practice of the Dhamma by asking, "Luang Pu, how does one cut off anger?" Luang Pu answered, "There's nobody who cuts it off. There's only being aware of it in time. When you're aware of it in time, it disappears on its own.”

And finally, another Ajahn Chah quote:

     “The Buddha said that the Enlightened Ones were far from defilements. This doesn't mean that they ran away from defilements, they didn't run away anywhere. Defilements were there. He compared it to a lotus leaf in a pond of water. The leaf and the water exist together, they are in contact, but the leaf doesn't become damp. The water is like defilements and the lotus leaf is the Enlightened Mind.

     The mind of one who practises is the same; it doesn't run away anywhere, it stays right there. Good, evil, happiness and unhappiness, right and wrong arise, and he knows them all. The meditator simply knows them, they don't enter his mind. That is, he has no clinging. He is simply the experiencer. To say he simply experiences is our common language. In the language of Dhamma we say he lets his mind follow the Middle Way.

      These activities of happiness, unhappiness and so on are constantly arising because they are characteristics of the world. The Buddha was enlightened in the world, he contemplated the world. If he hadn't contemplated the world, if he hadn't seen the world, he couldn't have risen above it. The Buddha's Enlightenment was simply enlightenment of this very world. The world was still there: gain and loss, praise and criticism, fame and disrepute, happiness and unhappiness were all still there. If there weren't these things there would be nothing to become enlightened to! What he knew was just the world, that which surrounds the hearts of people. If people follow these things, seeking praise and fame, gain and happiness, and trying to avoid their opposites, they sink under the weight of the world.” 

(in “Opening the Dhamma Eye”)

—

As I consider these quotes, it of course occurs to me that the teaching within may be a misrepresentation of what Arahantship means, an underestimation of the enormity of the shift. Obviously, if that were the case, it comes with certain implications about many teachers, which I should navigate with care. That being said, it’s possible it is in fact I that am misunderstanding here.

(1) First, perhaps I am reading too much into things said with conventional language (as well as having been translated), in a conventional context and not precise but rather for the benefit of the one listening. Perhaps LP Piak’s description points to this, and is very clear on the matter re:defilements- and as far as I can tell, in line with the suttas. And with the second LP Dune story, he could perhaps be pointing to anatta- especially, once again, in context & with convention so that the person listening might better understand. I best not underestimate the tendency for language (and doubly so through translation) and context to muddle the meaning.

(2) Second, it I must examine the texts.

     “…In all matters the sage is unsupported, nothing that makes dear, nor undear, sorrow and avarice do not stain that one, As water does not stay upon a leaf. As a water-drop on lotus plant, as water does not stain a lotus flower, even so the sage is never stained by seen, heard, or whatever’s cognized. Certainly the wise do not conceive upon the seen, the heard, and cognized, nor wish for purity through another, for they are not attached nor yet displeased.”
Jara Sutta, Sn4.6

I read Dhammapada 83 before:

     “Virtuous beings are unattached.
    They do not indulge in heedless speech
    about sensual pleasures.
    They experience both joy and sorrow
    but are possessed by neither.”

This translation is by Ajahn Munindo, an Ajahn Chah follower (and also associated with the likes of LP Sumedho, whose talk “Do Arahants Like Ice Cream?” is worth hearing just to understand his idea of it.) I found something different in other translations:

     True persons give up everything,
     Sabbattha ve sappurisā cajanti,
     they don’t cajole for the things they desire.
     Na kāmakāmā lapayanti santo;
     Though touched by sadness or happiness,
     Sukhena phuṭṭhā atha vā dukhena,
     the astute appear neither depressed nor elated.
     Na uccāvacaṁ paṇḍitā dassayanti. 

This one is by Bhante Sujato, who I suspect favors a similar view, but translated those two lines more literally. Ajahn Munindo’s liberal use of “joy” and “sorrow” for “sukha” and “dukkha” implies the same take as before. (Disclaimer- I don’t know Pali, and only picked out those words.) A number of other translators chose similarly.

I know dukkha had different and sometimes nuanced meanings depending on context. The dukkha of the three characteristics to me implies the inherent unsatisfactoriness of anything of the world, which the Arahant still knows, along with anatta and anicca. For the Arahant, “though still in contact with the world, unshaken the mind remains, beyond all sorrow, spotless, secure.” (Mangala Sutta) And there is of course the dukkha of the first arrow vs the second arrow, the second of which would match with the dukkha of the Four Noble Truths.

I’m not really sure what my exact question is here. It’s not my place to cast a judgement on whether these respected teachers are Ariya beings, especially considering my first possible misunderstanding. However, the idea that comes out of these words, while it might be a creation of my own mind rather than actually intended, feels shaky when cross-examined. If I understand correctly, HH might have something to say about all this. Happy to be pointed to a piece of writing already completed (but would appreciate help with anything super technical, please.) Would appreciate if anyone can add to this!

Sorry for the length of the post. Gratitude 🙏

Edit: adding AN 4.195 (worth reading in its entirety)

“manasā dhammaṁ viññāya neva **sumano** hoti na **dummano**; upekkhako viharati sato sampajāno. Knowing a thought with the mind, they’re neither happy nor sad, but remain equanimous, mindful and aware.”

Excerpt From
Aṅguttaranikāya [Pali-English]: Numbered Discourses
Bhikkhu Sujato


- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1g3wwxv/touched_by_joy_and_sorrow_questioning_some_quotes/ls1fsh7/)** _2024-10-15 14:01:44:

    See Itivuttaka 44:

    >And what is the element of extinguishment with residue? It's when a bhikkhu is an Arahant, who has destroyed the influxes, completed the renunciate journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, arrived at the highest goal, utterly destroyed the fetters of being, and is liberated through the right, ultimate knowledge. His five sense faculties still remain unimpaired, and so he continues to experience the agreeable and disagreeable, to feel pleasure and pain. The ending of passion, aversion and muddledness in him is called the element of extinguishment with residue.

    See also MN 152, which states about an Arahant:

    >...when seeing a form with the eye, there arises in a monk what is agreeable, what is disagreeable, what is agreeable and disagreeable. If he wants, he remains percipient of loathsomeness in the presence of what is not loathsome. If he wants, he remains percipient of unloathsomeness in the presence of what is loathsome. If he wants, he remains percipient of loathsomeness in the presence of what is not loathsome and what is. If he wants, he remains percipient of unloathsomeness in the presence of what is loathsome & what is not. If he wants — in the presence of what is loathsome and what is not — cutting himself off from both, he remains equanimous, aware, & mindful.

    In theory, it's not wrong to say that pleasure and pain remain in an Arahant. But it also depends on the context and the audience. If they incline towards the view of being—welcoming, delighting, enjoying—which is the more common scenario, then it's more accurate to say that Nibbāna is the destruction of feelings ([even of consciousness altogether](https://suttacentral.net/sn12.1/en/bodhi?lang=en)) since that can bring *them* closer to the middle, and away from their delight in feelings. But if they incline towards[ the view of non-being—resisting and denying](https://suttacentral.net/sn1.24/en/bodhi?lang=en)—which can happen more with monastics and very earnest practitioners, then stating that not everything needs to be destroyed might nudge *them* closer to the middle. But, one thing for sure, there is no room for debate concerning [the acts an Arahant is incapable of](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an9.7), regardless of which angle you take.

    You can't necessarily judge the validity of what someone teaches based solely on how they describe the final goal, especially if it’s expressed as generically as, “X is still there, but you are no longer attached to it.” Even the most erroneous views about the Dhamma can be made to fit into such a broad framework.

    >an Arahant still experiences dukkha, but that there is no self in it, that it is simply “dukkha arising and dukkha passing away.”

    Taking this as an example, you would need to dig deeper to find out what does \*"\*dukkha" actually mean *for them,* and whether the views, attitudes, and practices that they proclaim for reaching that goal actually match what the Suttas instruct. Using the [right phrases](https://suttacentral.net/sn5.10/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=main&notes=asterisk&highlight=true&script=latin#6.1) doesn't amount to much in itself. Hence, the Buddha said that someone can get the phrasing of a teaching right, but not the meaning, and vice versa. This topic is a case where that distinction becomes particularly evident.

### Monks online 

Lately I’ve been trying to limit internet usage as a form of entertainment. Obviously the Venerables have internet access. I was wondering do they avoid frivolous browsing like reading news or social media for example and just stick to things dealing with study, teaching and spreading of the Dhamma?

    >I was wondering do they avoid frivolous browsing like reading news or social media for example and just stick to things dealing with study, teaching and spreading of the Dhamma?

    By being aware of your intentions even before you pick up a device and while you are using it too, making sure that it's never one of distraction or entertainment, which could easily happen even if the initial intention was appropriate.

    >“And how, bhikkhus, has a bhikkhu comprehended a mode of conduct and manner of dwelling in such a way that as he conducts himself thus and as he dwells thus, evil unwholesome states of covetousness and displeasure do not flow in upon him? Suppose a man would enter a thorny forest. There would be thorns in front of him, thorns behind him, thorns to his left, thorns to his right, thorns below him, thorns above him. He would go forward mindfully, he would go back mindfully, thinking, ‘May no thorn prick me!’ So too, bhikkhus, whatever in the world has a pleasing and agreeable nature is called a thorn in the Noble One’s Discipline. Having understood this thus as ‘a thorn,’ one should understand restraint and nonrestraint.

### Sense pleasures

There is a lot of emphasis on abandonment of sense pleasures in the dhamma talks.

What would one mean exactly by that? For example, when im free i mostly use my phone(most of it is consuming dhamma content), listen to music, talk to family or exercise. Is one not to do these at all? And if one can still do it, how do you start to devalue sensual pleasures.

When i dont use my phone or do any other things i just sit in one place and stare at the wall. Is that the correct thing to do? And how do i be mindful of my intentions and truly be self aware.

Please offer me your advice and do correct me in case I got something wrong.

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1fztfbr/sense_pleasures/lr7dkur/)** _2024-10-10 04:16:54:

    It's more about abandoning sensual craving than avoiding every pleasant sense experience as such. However, certain things are *always* done out of sensual craving, and listening to music would be one of them. If you give up all sexual activity, beautification of the body, entertainment, and eating for the sake of pleasure, you will have eliminated the specific actions that are always driven by sensual craving.   
      
    Everything else, such as exercising or talking to family, isn't sensual in itself; it becomes sensual depending on how and why you do it—whether you're engaging in conversation just to pass the time and have fun or for a practical purpose, whether you're exercising to improve your outward appearance or for health reasons, etc.

    >When i dont use my phone or do any other things i just sit in one place and stare at the wall. Is that the correct thing to do?

    Occasionally it could be (in dedicated periods of contemplation once you're well restrained), but it's not mandatory by any means. It could easily be an unwholesome intention of self-mortification if you think you *have* to do it.

    It hardly matters what you *do*; that will change from day to day depending on circumstances and events in your life. What matters most is what you *don't* do, no matter what: breaking the precepts and engaging in any of the inherently sensual acts I listed above.

    >I understand that its about abandoning but would me not indulging in the sense pleasure result in that?

    >For example: if i stop listening to music now and then a few months later I hear a track I really used to like, I would imagine that I would still crave to listen to it. It’s different that im being disciplined but the craving would still be there.

    Restraint alone will certainly not result in that by itself. But what will happen is, when you start to restrain yourself, you won't simply "forget" about those things for months at a stretch. Your mind will be very frequently trying to convince you to listen to music again, or whatever the case may be. That's when the practice begins; the precepts and avoidance of specific things was just the "setup" for the practice.

    When the mind is craving for that which it can no longer have, you start contemplating the danger in sensual indulgence, and how it's pointless and leads to nothing but further dissatisfaction—[like a dog gnawing on a fleshless bone](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn54#mn54:15.1-mn54:15.11). Over time, your mind would begin to regard sensual pleasures like that automatically, and restraint would no longer be a matter of "discipline" since there would simply be no interest.

    >Also food is a big thing that my mind goes towards or looks forward to when i restrain it from other pleasures. But i have to eat, so how do I develop the understanding of when im eating out of duty and when im eating out of pleasure.

    I would focus on perfecting the other things first, since eating with the right motivation is  a subtler practice that comes a bit later in the training.

    Your mind will likely be delighting in food more than before when you've taken away everything else, but that alone is not an issue. You still have the option to [eat with the context of survival and not the context of pleasure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmYzJSvZ5jE&pp=ygUhc2ltaWxlIG9mIHRoZSBzb25zIGZsZXNoIGhpbGxzaWRl) despite the mind craving for the food. And then you begin to realize that sensuality really isn't in the sensual objects themselves but in the attitude of indulgence: even though you may well be eating the same things, the mind will be unhappy simply because you're not allowing it to wallow in the food internally.

    Kamma is not some sort of moral energy that you accumulate. There can of course be external consequences for your actions as well, but the core of "bad kamma" lies in what you're doing to your own mind. You're fueling its craving and thus making it more liable to suffering when you allow it to act out of greed, aversion, or delusion. So yes, any action whatsoever that is rooted in those things is "bad kamma", even if the whole world thinks it's fine or even praiseworthy:

    >“Bhikkhus, there are these three sources that give rise to actions. What three? Greed, hate, and delusion are sources that give rise to actions. Any action that emerges from greed, aversion, or delusion—born, sourced, and originated from greed, aversion, or delusion—is unbeneficial, blameworthy, results in suffering, and leads to the production of actions, not their cessation. These are three sources that give rise to actions.

    >There are these three sources that give rise to actions. What three? Non-greed, non-aversion, and non-delusion are sources that give rise to actions. Any action that emerges from non-greed, non-aversion, and non-delusion—born, sourced, and originated from non-greed, non-aversion, or non-delusion—is beneficial, blameless, results in happiness, and leads to the cessation of actions, not their production. These are three sources that give rise to actions.”

    >What is kamma then, what does the word refer to?  And what determines where someone is reborn?  

    Kamma is the action itself. In the Sutta I quoted above, the Pāli is *kamma* each time "action" occurs. So, you don't "incur" bad kamma; you *do* bad kamma right at the moment of the action if the intention is one of greed, aversion, or delusion. Thus, beings are the direct owners of their actions, and there is no external force or divine principle that can interfere with that.

    >Is the only benefit of giving dana or generating merit the fairly temporary wholesome state of mind that it produces?

    There can be a temporary pleasant state that only lasts shortly, but the inclination towards non-greed (in relative terms) shapes your character and mental tendencies, thus influencing your future actions and decisions and where you end up in subsequent existences.

    >Do we then get a clean slate with each rebirth?

    You get a clean slate to *choose* every second of your life, i.e., the momentum of your past choices cannot possibly force you to make the same choices again. It's you who chooses to give in to the pressure of habits. 

    And it's the same throughout this life as it is throughout multiple ones. In this very life, the fact that your mind pressures you to keep drinking or smoking if you've been doing it before doesn't mean you can't say no. It's just that the habits that pass on to the next life are much less specific (lack of virtue, covetousness, dishonesty, hatred, arrogance, stubbornness, etc.).

### Citta is Where the Heart Is?

In Hillside Hermitage's latest talk [Learning the Language of the Mind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3E276FZat1s) it is mentioned near the end that citta is where the heart is. For me this doesn't compute. Like, at all. I have been trying to see citta as the container of the experience as a whole such as the mood or the shape of experience, but this citta being located where the heart is making me doubt I even know up from down anymore. Anyone able to shed more light on the heart being talked about here?

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1fzr6n9/citta_is_where_the_heart_is/lr7gktp/)** _2024-10-10 04:42:51:

    >I have been trying to see citta as the container of the experience as a whole such as the mood or the shape of experience

    I would suggest continuing in that same direction and not making a big deal out of the confusion. You would come to understand the point rightly based on that, as opposed to sensation-based meditation practices that would only lead you to misconceive the body even more while thinking you're seeing it clearly.

    The disclaimer in the description of the video is there for a reason:

    >This practice is only applicable to those who are already sufficiently established in virtue and have been restraining their senses from intentional distraction and unbeneficial states, **otherwise any notion of "heart", "body" or "mind" that they have will not be pertaining to the true internal physicality of rupa.**

    Simply put, the reason why that's a prerequisite is that sensuality and non-restraint keep one's mind and views firmly planted in the domain of external sense objects. So when an unrestrained person tries to discern the body, they cannot help but "objectify" it and misconceive it as a collection of sense objects (most commonly tactile sensations). But the actual "internal" body (the "physicality" as referred to in the talk) is something else, described as a ["hollow, empty village" that gets attacked by bandits](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.238/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=none&notes=none&highlight=true&script=latin), and it can only be seen clearly once the pull of sense objects is no longer able to lure you into acts of greed, aversion, or distraction. 

    The mind is also a sense base, so even if you don't misconceive the body as sensations, you can start descending into and proliferating abstract notions about the body. Even if they are correct in theory, those are still sense objects, not the "internal" body that was being referred to where you would discern the "heart". And that's what the citta *corresponds to*, as said in the video; not that that *is* the citta.

    ([This discussion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB9dQFtXMKs) is also relevant to the topic).

    >My question is, is there any danger of going too far with this inclusion? In other words, can I "over" include to the point where I miss the mark?

    Yes, that can and often does happen, in the form of the view that all thinking is bad, and it's about "just being mindful", etc.

    You do need to think, ponder, and clarify when you have evidently lost the clarity, i.e., when you catch yourself starting to incline towards carelessness and unwholesome actions even on a mental level. Then you "refresh" the contexts and contemplations, but only to the extent that there is a practical purpose for it (i.e., a direct connection with abandoning unwholesome states here and now) and not more than that.

### A question about moderation and secular living.


Hello. Let's assume I'm an ordinary person and I don't have a strict ambition to achieve stream entry. As a lay person, is it necessary for me to follow the 8 precepts? What if a given person is interested in Buddhism as something that is to constitute his spirituality as a form of defense against complete absorption by "worldly things", but at the same time does not see the power of renunciation. I think Buddha also gave some advice for this type of person, such as collecting "merits", "generosity", eradicating traits that harm other people?

In short, I mean how do you see the approach to life for such an ordinary person. In Buddhist countries there are often millions of people who declare themselves to be Buddhists, what compromise do you see for them?

    No, eight precepts would not be "necessary" for such a person. It's almost guaranteed that they wouldn't even have the motivation to forego sensuality and distractions unless they were aiming for liberation anyway. Even if they happened to be celibate for some reason, they would find another way to fill that gap emotionally. Thus, they wouldn't be truly living aloof from sensuality, which is the practical meaning of "8 precepts".

    >I think Buddha also gave some advice for this type of person, such as collecting "merits", "generosity", eradicating traits that harm other people?

    Certainly. He would advise everyone no matter who they are and what they want to keep the five precepts and to be generous (and so do many other religions at least in part). That's the type of person he would give instructions similar to those in the [Sigalovādasutta](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.31.0.nara.html).

### 2 questions about the three characteristics formula

Sabbe sankhara anicca

sabbe sankhara dukkha

sabbe dhamma anatta

In this classical formula there are two points that are still unclear to me.

First :

I don't get why does it switch from sankhara to dhamma. It would imply that something escapes one of the categories ?!

Does it mean that everything is not self but not everything is anicca and dukkha ? Or that all determinations are anicca and dukkha but that not all determinations are anatta ? So either something(s) in the dhamma category is not sankhara or sth in the sankhara category is not a dhamma...

Second :

I'm trying to see some kind of logic in the order of the three statement.

For example,

Anicca would be the fact that everything that something depends on is liable to change.

Anatta would be the fact that I am subjected to this change. I can't do anything about it. My eye through which I'm getting sights does his own thing; I can't choose to not see or not have a declining eyesight. Even If I would be taking medecine, the healing process (anicca) would be totally out of my control (anatta). As such, all those ever changing determinations, pertaining to *that body because of which* that are outside my reach are inherently and always unsatisfactory (dukkha).

So the order : anicca >anatta>dukkha makes quite a lot of sense but apparently if the correct order (if there is one) is anicca>dukkha>anatta the causal step between dukkha and anatta is hazy to me. What am I missing ?

Any input is welcome !

  
EDIT : 

I kinda found an answer in a previous answer from [u/AlexCoventry](https://www.reddit.com/user/AlexCoventry/) quoting Nanavira even though I'm still not entirely clear how dukkha helps in understanding anatta...

[Sabbe sankhārā aniccā; Sabbe sankhārā dukkhā; Sabbe dhammā anattā.](https://nanavira.org/index.php/notes-on-dhamma/shorter-notes/dhamma) (*'All determinations are impermanent; All determinations are unpleasurable (suffering); All things are not-self.'*) *Attā*, 'self', is fundamentally a notion of *mastery over things* (cf. Majjhima iv,5 <M.i,231-2> & Khandha Samy. vi,7 <S.iii,66>\[[7](https://nanavira.org/index.php/notes-on-dhamma/additional-texts#7)\]). But this notion is entertained only if it is pleasurable,\[[c](https://nanavira.org/index.php/notes-on-dhamma/shorter-notes/dhamma#nc)\] and it is only pleasurable provided the mastery is assumed to be permanent; for a mastery—which is essentially a kind of absolute timelessness, an *unmoved* moving of things—that is undermined by impermanence is no mastery at all, but a mockery. Thus the regarding of a thing, a *dhamma*, as *attā* or 'self' can survive for only so long as the notion gives pleasure, and it only gives pleasure for so long as that *dhamma* can be considered as permanent (for the regarding of a thing as 'self' endows it with the illusion of a kind of super-stability in time). In itself, *as a* dhamma *regarded as* attā, its impermanence is not manifest (for it is pleasant to consider it as permanent); but when it is seen to be dependent upon *other dhammā* not considered to be permanent, its impermanence does then become manifest. To see impermanence in what is regarded as *attā*, one must emerge from the confines of the individual *dhamma* itself and see that *it depends on what is impermanent*. Thus *sabbe sankhārā* (not *dhammā*) *aniccā* is said, meaning 'All things that things (*dhammā*) depend on are impermanent'. A given *dhamma, as a* dhamma *regarded as* attā, is, on account of being so regarded, considered to be pleasant; but when it is seen to be dependent upon some other *dhamma* that, not being regarded as *attā*, is manifestly unpleasurable (owing to the invariable false perception of permanence, of super-stability, in one not free from *asmimāna*), then its own unpleasurableness becomes manifest. Thus *sabbe sankhārā* (not *dhammā*) *dukkhā* is said. When this is seen—i.e. when perception of permanence and pleasure is understood to be false --, the notion 'This *dhamma* is my *attā*' comes to an end, and is replaced by *sabbe dhammā anattā*. Note that it is the *sotāpanna* who, knowing and seeing that his perception of permanence and pleasure is false, is free from this notion of 'self', though not from the more subtle conceit '(I) am' (*asmimāna*);\[[d](https://nanavira.org/index.php/notes-on-dhamma/shorter-notes/dhamma#nd)\] but it is only the *arahat* who is entirely free from the (false) perception of permanence and pleasure, and 'for him' perception of impermanence is no longer unpleasurable. (See also [A NOTE ON PATICCASAMUPPĀDA §12](https://nanavira.org/index.php/notes-on-dhamma/paticcasamuppada#p12) & [PARAMATTHA SACCA](https://nanavira.org/index.php/notes-on-dhamma/paramattha-sacca).)

    >Does it mean that everything is not self but not everything is anicca and dukkha ?

    In theory, yes, something which isn't *saṅkhata* ("conditioned" or "determined") will not be *anicca* or *dukkha*. But it's not that there is one experience or state that you can just arrive at that would in itself be *asaṅkhata* regardless of *your* way of relating to it. As I've mentioned before, *saṅkhāras* are things for which one is entirely responsible[ due to one's ignorance](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn38#mn38:17.1). Nibbāna cannot be an outside thing that "rescues" you from *saṅkhāras* because nothing can destroy your ignorance for you.

    So practically speaking, [until ignorance is abandoned, even (your idea of) Nibbāna is *anicca*, *dukkha, and anattā.*](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn1#mn1:26.1-mn1:26.4)

    >So the order : anicca >anatta>dukkha makes quite a lot of sense but apparently if the correct order (if there is one) is anicca>dukkha>anatta the causal step between dukkha and anatta is hazy to me. What am I missing ?

    You could say that the full "sequence" is *attā > anicca > dukkha > anattā.* In order for it not to be abstract, you need to start by recognizing that you have *already* taken certain things as yours. Even if you deny it through the learned notion that "there is no self," wherever there is delight, passion, and any concern about something being destroyed, there is appropriation.

    Only from that personally applicable as opposed to theoretical starting point is *anicca* automatically and directly seen as *dukkha.* The fact that something is liable to perish is only painful because you delight in and assume ownership over it. Seeing that sufficiently automatically results in disenchantment and abandoning of what you used to grasp, i.e., what was *attā* (or belonging to *attā*) becomes *anattā*.

    You're probably thinking in terms of Ven. Ñāṇavīra's definition of *saṅkhāras* as "determinations"—things that are a basis for other things. That's not necessarily wrong and it can be enough to uproot self-view, but there's a more accurate way to look at it (which is why these days we translate *saṅkhāra* as "activities" or "activations").

    In fact, the Suttas don't really use the word *saṅkhāra* in that sense in most contexts where it occurs. See for example this well-known verse:

    *“Impermanent are all activities (saṅkhāra), of the nature to arise and pass away.*

    *Having arisen, they cease; their* ***stilling*** *(vūpasamo) is what's pleasant.”*

    The standard definition of Nibbāna:

    *“This is peaceful; this is sublime—that is,* [*the stilling of all activities*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1qG8z_yV1M) *(sabba-saṅkhāra-samatho), the letting go of all appropriation, the ending of craving, dispassion, cessation, Nibbāna.”*

    And also Suttas like SN 36.11, where the "progressive cessation/stilling of *saṅkhāras*" is described (i.e., the jhānas). "Determinations" are not something you can "still" in that sense. The body will always continue to be the necessary basis for your experience, for example.

    Therefore, the most common meaning of *saṅkhāra* in the Suttas could be rendered as "a doing/activity", and hence you are responsible both for their continuation and for their cessation. But being responsible is not the same as having a direct, immediate choice in the matter, as some people would think they do when practicing "letting go of all doing". As I mentioned, *saṅkhāras* are a direct result of ignorance, so if ignorance is still there, they will be there too even if you let go of everything in sight, and when ignorance is not there anymore, they *can't* be there even if you want them to.

    So you could say that what you're directly responsible for is acting out of the five hindrances and lack of restraint, [because of which ignorance would be further fueled.](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an10.62#an10.62:2.4-an10.62:2.9)

    Going back to the three characteristics "formula", seeing that all "doings" are impermanent and suffering *indirectly*—similar to Ñāṇavīra's approach—uproots the taking of any *dhamma* as "mine". That illustrates how whether you think you have a self or not is irrelevant; what determines the presence of selfhood (certain *dhammas* taken as self) is the presence of *saṅkhāras*, and these only continue for as long as they are not seen clearly (as impermanent and unpleasant). The most fundamental *saṅkhāras* would be passion, aversion, and delusion, as per SN 36.11.

    >And in all the other instances (i.e. the three fold formula or *Anicca vata sankhara*) where *sankhara* is used with a passive meaning and ends up being more or less equivalent to *sankhata*, keeping using "conditioned phenomena" which seems more intuitive.

    I don't see any justification in the Suttas to assume a passive meaning for *saṅkhāra* in any instance. I would call that "patchwork", which becomes necessary when people (especially scholars) prioritize fitting things into a theoretical framework rather than seeing for themselves how the Buddha's usage of these terms pointed directly towards freedom from craving and suffering.

    The word *saṅkhata* exists and [is used in the Suttas](https://suttacentral.net/an3.47/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=sidebyside&reference=none&notes=none&highlight=false&script=latin) a few times, so the Buddha could've easily said "*sabbaṃ saṅkhataṃ aniccaṃ"* to avoid ambiguity. But that wouldn't free you from suffering, precisely because it's "more intuitive" (i.e., it doesn't take a Buddha to discover it and noble insight to understand it).

    In fact, if *saṅkhāra* were to mean "conditioned phenomenon", it wouldn't be possible to free oneself from them entirely. Apart from all the other "conditioned phenomena" that an Arahant would inevitably continue to experience, Nibbāna itself, the *asaṅkhata,* depends on the condition of having freed oneself from passion and ignorance, so it's not "unconditioned". Not only that, but that condition itself *is* also permanent, which would invalidate the statement "***sabbe*** *saṅkhārā aniccā".*

    But Nibbāna *is* free from all "doing" (or even "condition-ing" or "determining, if one insists), i.e. devoid of *saṅkhāras*. That's why it's also the cessation of *kamma*.
- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1fz1z1k/2_questions_about_the_three_characteristics/lrirmud/)** _2024-10-12 04:25:32 *(in reply to a comment not included)*:

    >Even though I totally understand your reasoning which runs against taking sankhara as sankhata in certain instances, isn't it just possible that we could have in pali too some words which covers passive and active meaning ? I mean "formation" can be understood as the action of forming, being formed, or as a structure or arrangement of something.

    Yes, but again, there would be no reason to risk ambiguity when *saṅkhata* exists and isn't uncommon. Plus, there isn't any instance in Nikāyas where reading *saṅkhāra* as "conditioned phenomenon" is justifiable, let alone necessary. It remains impersonal and abstract, unrelated to suffering and its cessation. If you at least understand it as *things that condition/determine (you)*, as Ñāṇavīra did, there would at least be an implication of *paṭiccasamuppāda,* which is indeed practical and relevant, and would free you from suffering.

    >Could you elaborate a little bit on how to understand properly "doings" where indeed scholars and most of the buddhist establishments understand sankhara as a passive thing and HH not ?

    "Doings" wouldn't be the best general rendering because it's limited to your intentions. That's one type of *saṅkhāra*, but not all of them. "Makings\*"\* might be better, since it covers both the things you do and the things that make (you). In either case, it's *active*.

    >I mean, nobody thinks an activity is permanent, right ? An activity/doing necessarily implies a change.

    Worldly activities, sure; analyzing things on that external level would make no difference. Understanding "*saṅkhāras* are impermanent" won't make you a *sotāpanna; w*hat does is to truly see that ***all*** *saṅkhāras* are impermanent. In other words, you have to see that certain subtler things in your experience[ you may not even regard as such *are* actually *saṅkhāras*.](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=sn22.81#sn22.81:5.3-sn22.81:5.12) You have to stop overlooking them, taking them for granted. And that's what it means to grasp the sign of the mind.

    For example, most people wouldn't see that the five hindrances are activities that take place *in regard to* their thoughts. Thus, they would try to get rid of the thoughts themselves, believing that they are the problem.

    But the relevant activity (or "movement") there is non-endurance/delight/aversion in regard to the arisen pressure, so whether you proliferate *or* deny the thoughts by focusing on physical sensations instead, it will be within that same *saṅkhāra* that remains unseen. There will be internal motion even in that seeming quietude of no thinking.

    Only once you clearly see and "still" the activity of sensuality-and-aversion properly can you go on to still the activity of thinking, [hence you need to be established in the first jhāna in order to enter the second.](https://suttacentral.net/an9.35/en/thanissaro?lang=en&reference=none&highlight=false) Otherwise, you end up with neither (i.e., with "absorption" or "concentration").

    Have a closer read of SN 36.11, which shows that it's *saṅkhāras* as "activities" (e.g., speaking, thinking, breathing, even feeling, ultimately) that the Buddha refers to when he says they're impermanent:

    >And I have also said: ‘Whatever is felt is included in suffering.’ That has been stated by me with reference **to the impermanence of** ***saṅkhāras***. That has been stated by me with reference to *saṅkhāras* being subject to destruction … to *saṅkhāras* being subject to vanishing … to *saṅkhāras* being subject to fading away … to *saṅkhāras* being subject to cessation … to *saṅkhāras* being subject to change.

    >“But, bhikkhu, I have also taught the **successive cessation of** ***saṅkhāras***. For one who has attained the first jhana, speech has ceased. For one who has attained the second jhana, thought and examination have ceased...

    At the end of the day, Ñāṇavīra's interpretation of *saṅkhāras* is good enough because it factually conveys *paṭiccasamuppāda* (the more popular "conditioned phenomenon" one doesn't) and would thus bring you to the same place—cessation of ignorance > cessation of activities—if rightly pursued. It's just that it's not really how the Buddha was using the term in the Suttas.

### Question from Ajahn's essay 'Appearance and Existence'. 

Full Essay: [https://www.hillsidehermitage.org/appearance-and-existence/](https://www.hillsidehermitage.org/appearance-and-existence/)

“There is what is given and what is offered and what is sacrificed; there is fruit and result of good and bad actions; there is this world and the other world; there is mother and father; there are spontaneously reborn beings; there are in the world good and virtuous recluses and brahmins who have realised for themselves by direct knowledge and declare this world and the other world.” (MN 117/iii,72)

"This easily overlooked passage offers a very acute description of an *authentic* attitude of a *puthujjana*—the attitude of recognition and acknowledgment of the existence of things *as* phenomena (“*there is…”)*. Someone might argue that one does not necessarily see the spontaneously reborn beings for example, **but the point is that one should recognize the mere fact that there** ***could be*** **spontaneously reborn beings—the** ***possibility*** **of spontaneously reborn beings** ***exists*** **as such.** And if one recognizes the validity of the appearance and existence of that possibility, an *expectation of the concrete proof* that can be obtained only through *senses* (i.e. one needs to *see* those beings) ceases to be relevant, in the same way that a view that a thing exists only if it can be experienced through the senses ceases."

The argument made here in support of the possibility of existence of spontaneously reborn beings is that the possibility of their existence is real as such.

It can be argued that the possibility of them not existing is real as such as well. So how can one believe one over the other?

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1fww91w/question_from_ajahns_essay_appearance_and/lql5gk7/)** _2024-10-06 08:06:28:

    >It can be argued that the possibility of them not existing is real as such as well. So how can one believe one over the other?

    The point of that is to go beyond the scientific point of view that most people are trapped in—a form of "mundane wrong view"—where they assume that something can be real only if it appears to their five senses. You would only begin to prioritize the possibility of the thing not existing if you've fallen back into that scientific mindset.

    The phenomenological point of view, which the entire Dhamma is founded on, would not *deny* scientific evidence but would recognize that it's just another phenomenon in your experience that isn't intrinsically more fundamental than all others. Regarding it as the lens through which everything else should be seen is a *choice*. And that choice is not necessarily wrong when it comes to mundane matters, but it is when it comes to the five aggregates because science is *within* them, not the other way around.

    If you acknowledge that, you would see that there always remains the possibility, no matter how remote, for things to be otherwise than the evidence from your five senses shows you. And that recognition is enough to return to the phenomenological perspective. You don't have to believe in specific possibilities right from the start.

### So I feel like I'm possessed

This might seem like a strange and mystical subject that doesn't belong here, but anyone who has read Nyanamoli's *Meanings* will know that the phenomenon of "feeling possessed" is a thing that *can* happen, even along the path.  

For me, it precedes my Buddhist practice.  It's difficult to communicate what it's like feeling yourself as a plurality, or a plurality in yourself. I've experienced the inverse too, like I was a thief in my own body, like I stole a life, body, and memories that don't belong to me. It hasn't been a continuous thing and it's current manifestation is more unnerving than it's been for a while.

Like Mathias said in *Meanings*, it undermines one's ability to act. Who is acting? If I doubt my current state of mind and feel like "I" am not in control and fight to "regain" control from the possessing force, why should I believe "my" attempts to "regain" control are "my own"?  How should I consider the intention to fight for control?  Does acting out of the perception of being possessed reinforce this very phenomenon?  

I had a dream a while ago.  A wicked man was talking.  He finished whatever he was saying with the chilling words "*I have the best seat in the house.* ***Behind your eyes***." I had another similar dream this morning.

Now, the Buddha taught that one who keeps the upasotha cannot be possessed by spirits. I ought to be safe from *them*, but is that all that can possess someone? What about this "self"? Do we dare go into the psychological notions of possession here? 

Anyway, I don't actually feel all that worried now that it's passed. I try to see it as an image that has arisen, much like self.   I used to have a deep fear of losing my mind and losing control. That actually served as a big motivator on the path.  Because if someone restrained and virtuous who wants nothing loses their mind, can you even tell? They just sit there like usual. I'm the owner of my actions. I'm gonna keep my precepts and restraint and just keep going. I appreciate any advice or input on this subject. 

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1fwty0o/so_i_feel_like_im_possessed/lqkvmv3/)** _2024-10-06 06:19:10:

    I would try not to read into it, and focus on the same principle as always: making sure not to act in unwholesome ways, regardless of what the origin of the pressure is. You won't lose your mind unless you fail to do that, even in the worst of scenarios.

    Also, you might have to be extra diligent with that if you have a history of mental health struggles. That can often be due to your mind wielding more power over you than "normal", so it will tend to have more tools in its arsenal to trick you. But it's not that people with mental health issues belong to a different category; it's just the normal condition intensified (or no longer successfully covered up).

### Is jhana only attainable by a sotapanna and above?

Maybe I'm misreading or misunderstanding the suttas I have looked at, but did the Buddha say that only someone who has gone beyond sensuality can attain jhanas? And does going beyond (valuing) sensuality make one a sotapanna?

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1ftec39/is_jhana_only_attainable_by_a_sotapanna_and_above/lptxaku/)** _2024-10-01 16:08:29:

    The Suttas clearly state that even eternalists can attain jhānas. The question whether what’s generally regarded as jhāna today—[not requiring dispassion and withdrawal from sensuality](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an6.73#an6.73:1.4-an6.73:2.1), but rather [skill in focusing on an object](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an11.9#an11.9:2.3-an11.9:2.17)—actually is what the Buddha taught and leads to genuine freedom from suffering is a separate issue, to which our answer is no.

    The point wasn't that you would never experience the hindrances again. It's that if you haven't clearly discerned the danger in sensuality (the 6th item in the Sutta), it's impossible to attain the pleasure of renunciation (i.e., jhāna), because [that context of danger is where the right type of "release" comes from](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an9.41#an9.41:7.1-an9.41:7.18). Not from focusing on an object.

    So, it's not stream entry that's indispensable for entering jhānas, but rather dispassion for sensuality. That's why some ascetics outside the Buddha's teaching sometimes did achieve it.

### I'm going to visit Samanadipa monastery this week and is my first time ever visiting a monastery and a monk in person.

Please, can someone advice me on how to approach the monastery? 

 - should I bring food or other things as an offer to the monastery/monks? 

 - how to interact with monks (everytime we engaged should I have joined palms? I want to learn about such formalities) 

- other things I should be aware of but I currently not

Thank you for your responses in advance 🙏

### How important is the unconditionality of the 8 precepts? (the additional 3, that is) 

So, I've cut off all entertainment except for one thing, the Dungeons and Dragons campaign I've been it for the past 3 years. We're very near the end of the campaign. It's a big source of internal tension because I've been celibate and sleeping on the floor and not eating after noon for a long time and this is the one thing holding me back from taking the 8 every day, all the time, for the rest fo my life.  I often don't enjoy it, or don't get nearly as much enjoyment from the game or company as I used to and I don't delight in what delight remains. Part of me has wanted to just drop out for a long time. 


Obviously there's issues with company, idle chatter, and the violence that's a part of the game.  It's once a week for like 3 hours. Am I worrying too much? Is it that bad if I see it through to the end? It seems absurd to imagine some magical boost to my practice by finally fulfilling the 8 precepts without exception when this is the **only exception**. It's really made me see how much pressure can come from the expectation of others, because it's much harder to abandon something that will affect others. 


Edit: As I said above, I've wanted to drop out for a long time, and I have. It was my intent from the beginning and I see now I wasn't "worrying too much" about the effects of continuing to play, because it feels much better having the 8 fulfilled. I think it's clear to everyone that it's ***better*** not to play, but what you see above is a genuine question about ***how*** such a compromise as continuing to play affects one's path. And yeah, it's also the defilements squirming, hoping to find a way to preserve something that I know would be ***better*** to be totally abandoned. Thank you for your responses, which have had the added benefit of helping me see how proud and defensive I can be.


Relevant sutta(MN 61)
 “Rāhula, it’s like a royal elephant: immense, pedigreed, accustomed to battles, its tusks like chariot poles. Having gone into battle, it uses its forefeet & hindfeet, its forequarters & hindquarters, its head & ears & tusks & tail, **but will simply hold back its trunk**. The elephant trainer notices that and thinks, ‘This royal elephant has not given up its life to the king.’ 

"But when the royal elephant… having gone into battle, uses its forefeet & hindfeet, its forequarters & hindquarters, its head & ears & tusks & tail **& his trunk**, the trainer notices that and thinks, ‘This royal elephant has given up its life to the king. There is nothing it will not do.’

    An excerpt from an essay in progress:

    >It’s important not to deceive yourself into thinking that, as a layperson, the threshold for what constitutes greed, aversion, or delusion is somehow more lenient, and you can get away with more. We all have the same defilements, and wearing jeans instead of robes won’t magically prevent indulgence in those defilements from [obstructing anyone’s progress in the Dhamma](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn22#mn22:5.7-mn22:6.15). If anything, it’s the opposite. The fact that, as a layperson, your environment and lifestyle most often already put you at a disadvantage—you're trying to grow a very delicate plant in less fertile ground—means that complacency carries a greater risk. And complacency in your views is not justified no matter how you live externally.

    >If keeping all the precepts is too difficult for you at the moment, the solution is not to move the goalpost and justify the shortcoming with the excuse that laypeople are not expected to do more. Taking what others do or don't do and not what you can discern for yourself as rooted in greed, aversion, or delusion as the guideline for what’s wrong is an attitude that will keep you bound to *sīlabbataparāmāsa*.

    >Instead, you need to be self-honest and stick to the same universal definition of what constitutes a fault—anything involving greed, aversion, and delusion, and which an Arahant would not engage in—even if that means feeling remorse for some things you still can’t give up. If you don’t obscure that recognition, don’t cover up the ensuing regret whenever you fail, and strive to do better than last time, then you may still be progressing despite the imperfections in your restraint. But if you re-define what a fault is to leave out the things you still have difficulty giving up, you are shooting yourself in the foot.

    >The first two of the five powers that a noble one possesses and that drive them further along the path are [shame and remorse (hiriottappā) ](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an4.163#an4.163:2.4-an4.163:2.5)in regard to unwholesome qualities.

    >This means that even when someone still lives as a householder keeping only the five precepts despite having attained the Right View, as was the case for many in the Buddha’s day, they won’t try to evade responsibility and find an external justification for fulfilling the training only partially. They would acknowledge that as a weakness on their part, even if it means feeling ashamed and remorseful. And this is precisely why, as said in the Suttas, everyone who has Right View is ultimately destined for full liberation sooner or later. Even when they’re heedless, they’re unable to lie to themselves about the fact that they’re not fully living in accordance with the Dhamma. This means that they will inevitably begin to do so at some point, and continue walking further on the same path until they reach the culmination.

    >The Buddha didn’t teach two modes of practice: one for laypeople and one for monastics. He taught one practice—the taming of passions and the giving up of attachments—that each individual is free to follow to whichever extent they please. How much they’ll be able to achieve is proportional to the extent that they undertake it. But someone who shifts the target so that they no longer need to see craving as craving and unwholesome as unwholesome has abandoned Right View and is no longer on the same path, even if they keep all the other precepts perfectly.

    >“*Gotamī, the things that you would know lead to passion, not dispassion; to attachment, not to detachment; to accumulation, not diminution; to abundance of desires, not fewness of desires; to discontent, not contentment; to socializing, not seclusion; to laziness, not effort; to being burdensome, not being unburdensome. Categorically, you should remember these things as not the Dhamma, not the training, and not the Teacher’s instructions.*

    >Why are these things said to be about virtue?

    All the ones about avoiding entertainment and beautification are already within the 8 precepts, and the ones about speech are also relevant. All of those fall within virtue because they're things that involve defilements on every occasoin, no matter who you are. Sense restraint is not categorical in that way; it's about what you should avoid only if the intention behind it is unwholesome.

    But the ones about not harming plants, not receiving money, raw grains, etc., are specifically for monks, mainly due to societal expectations.

    (Note that there is a bit of a mistranslation in one line. The Pali mentions[ "watching shows" in general](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=dn2#dn2:45.3), not just "unsuitable shows").

    Yes. It's still a very suboptimal condition, especially today when there's so much more room for sensuality and distraction within the five precepts than in the Buddha's time, but at least they haven't entirely fallen off the path as long as they don't justify their remaining indulgences and still see them as unwholesome.

    >It's as if developing the courage to face and endure the overwhelming gravity of one's situation (If you know you know) has been conveniently replaced by focusing on perfecting a set of rules because by doing so one doesn't have to face the overwhelming gravity of one's situation.

    Some people may end up misconstruing it that way if they don't read carefully enough (as with anything) but the purpose of breaking the five precepts, incelibacy, and indulging in entertainment *is,* knowingly or not, in every possible case, to avoid facing and enduring the overwhelming gravity of one's situation. Perhaps that part of the message doesn't always come through, but preventing that avoidance is exactly the purpose of the precepts, provided they're taken on with the right attitude. And that's why adding any more rules than the eight or overly defining them to include more than they're meant to is not advisable, since it will often result in the opposite: covering things up again.

    If most people were self-honest enough to see what's coming out of sensuality, aversion, or distraction right off the bat, there would be no need to talk about individual "rules" (as was the case with the early Saṅgha). And once you do have that self-honesty and become accomplished in virtue, you don't really think in terms of individual rules anymore. You're either being heedless and turning away from the Dhamma, or not.

    >These things lead to attachment and more suffering(they are harmful), and because the intention behind those activities will be out of line with the path. 

    Yes, so they are obstructions *for someone who hopes to reach freedom from suffering* because they increase craving and obstruct wisdom. They are unskillful from that point of view. That's not to say that they're "immoral", which is more about cultural norms than about liberation.

    Keeping just the five precepts properly may even be considered "immoral" by some people, since you would categorically refuse to kill any living being, no matter what threat it poses to you or others, and would refuse to tell a deliberate lie no matter what's at stake.

    >Is there perhaps a distinction between virtue and morality that I'm missing?

    There is, or at least there tends to be in the context of Dhamma, which is why translating *sīla* as "morality" or "ethics" can be very misleading. *sīla* has to do with not acting out of the coarse cravings in your own mind in order to tame it; what society says is irrelevant in that regard. Morality is imposed from the outside, and changes relatively quickly even within the same culture.

### How does one resist things ajjhataṃ?

>“Bhante, I am developing mindfulness of breathing.”

>“In what way, Ariṭṭha, are you developing mindfulness of breathing?”

>“Bhante, for me sensual desire for past sensuality has been abandoned, sensual desire for future sensuality has gone away, and the perception of **resistance towards things both here** and externally has been completely removed. Mindfully, I breathe in. Mindfully, I breathe out. In this way, Bhante, I am developing mindfulness of breathing.”

>“Ariṭṭha, this is mindfulness of breathing. I do not say that it isn't.”

>-- SN 54.6

If ajjhataṃ is the dimension of that which is here that makes it possible for things to be out there (bahiddhā), is "resisting things ajjhataṃ" resisting my situation, having been thrown into and being enclosed within that body, feeling, mind, ~~these dhammas~~ my experience as a whole?

Also, is it what craving for non-being is?

    >If ajjhataṃ is the dimension of that which is here that makes it possible for things to be out there (bahiddhā), is "resisting things ajjhataṃ" resisting my situation

    Yes, but that's a bit too theoretical. The "internal" dimension is what you're currently feeling here and now and pushes you towards external directions. Even if there's no blatant action externally, you can still resist things internally, even just a neutral feeling. That keeps you liable to the hindrances, even if none of them are acutely present there and then.

    >Also, is it what craving for non-being is?

    Craving for non-being would be what's left over once you've achieved what this Sutta describes, which is the state of an *anāgāmi.* The resistance to internal and external phenomena is inseparable from sensuality, so if one is there, the other is too.

### Not really sure what to make of AN 4.166

“Bhikkhus, there are these four modes of practice. What four? (1) Practice that is painful with sluggish direct knowledge; (2) practice that is painful with quick direct knowledge; (3) practice that is pleasant with sluggish direct knowledge; and (4) practice that is pleasant with quick direct knowledge.
(1) The mode of practice that is painful with sluggish direct knowledge is declared to be inferior for both reasons: because it is painful and because direct knowledge is sluggish. This mode of practice is declared to be inferior for both reasons.
(2) The mode of practice that is painful with quick direct knowledge is declared to be inferior because of its painfulness.
(3) The mode of practice that is pleasant with sluggish direct knowledge is declared to be inferior because of its sluggishness.
(4) The mode of practice that is pleasant with quick direct knowledge is declared to be superior for both reasons: because practice is pleasant and because direct knowledge is quick. This mode of practice is declared to be superior for both reasons.
These, bhikkhus, are the four modes of practice.”

I am confused, because this seems to be promoting a preference for pleasure. It does not match with my understanding.
For more context if you’re interested, AN 4.162

“Bhikkhus, there are these four modes of practice. What four? (1) Practice that is painful with sluggish direct knowledge; (2) practice that is painful with quick direct knowledge; (3) practice that is pleasant with sluggish direct knowledge; and (4) practice that is pleasant with quick direct knowledge.
(1) And what, bhikkhus, is the practice that is painful with sluggish direct knowledge? Here, someone is by nature strongly prone to lust and often experiences pain and dejection born of lust. By nature he is strongly prone to hatred and often experiences pain and dejection born of hatred. By nature he is strongly prone to delusion and often experiences pain and dejection born of delusion. These five faculties arise in him feebly: the faculty of faith, the faculty of energy, the faculty of mindfulness, the faculty of concentration, and the faculty of wisdom. Because these five faculties are feeble in him, he sluggishly attains the immediacy condition for the destruction of the taints. This is called practice that is painful with sluggish direct knowledge.
(2) And what is practice that is painful with quick direct knowledge? Here, someone is by nature strongly prone to lust … hatred … delusion and often experiences pain and dejection born of delusion. These five faculties arise in him prominently: the faculty of faith … the faculty of wisdom. Because these five faculties are prominent in him, he quickly attains the immediacy condition for the destruction of the taints. This is called practice that is painful with quick direct knowledge.
(3) And what is practice that is pleasant with sluggish direct knowledge? Here, someone by nature is not strongly prone to lust and does not often experience pain and dejection born of lust. By nature he is not strongly prone to hatred and does not often experience pain and dejection born of hatred. By nature he is not strongly prone to delusion and does not often experience pain and dejection born of delusion. These five faculties arise in him feebly: the faculty of faith … the faculty of wisdom. Because these five faculties are feeble in him, he sluggishly attains the immediacy condition for the destruction “of the taints. This is called practice that is pleasant with sluggish direct knowledge.
(4) And what is practice that is pleasant with quick direct knowledge? Here, someone by nature is not strongly prone to lust … hatred … delusion and does not often experience pain and dejection born of delusion. These five faculties arise in him prominently: the faculty of faith … the faculty of wisdom. Because these five faculties are prominent in him, he quickly attains the immediacy condition for the destruction of the taints. This is called practice that is pleasant with quick direct knowledge.“These, bhikkhus, are the four modes of practice.”

    The part that shouldn’t be overlooked here is that in neither case (speed or pleasantness) is it a matter of choice.

    If you have weak passion, aversion, and delusion—which you would judge not by what your intuition tells you, but by whether your mind rebels in the face of the eight precepts, sense restraint, and solitude—either by nature or because you’re already far along the path, the practice won’t be unpleasant; quite the opposite. As the Buddha said, the joy of sensuality is excrement compared to the joy of renunciation, which is not only great in itself, but also pushes you further on the path simply by virtue of cultivating it.

### meditation not taught to non stream enterers

So when the Buddha prescribes mediation it is never mentioned that he is talking to a puthujjana but, it's also usually not mentioned whether or not he is talking to a stream enterer. And there are suttas where the Buddha is trying to inspire people by describing samsara(how unending and unsatisfying it is and how it is enough to become disenchanted with the world and commit to attaining nibbana) and then he says to go sit at the roots of trees and meditate. If the buddha knew he was talkling to stream enterers then why would he need to inspire them in this way? Would it not make more sense that he was considering that at least some of the people he was talking to would not be stream enterers? 

What is some evidence from the suttas that Buddha did not want puthujjanas to meditate?

    Such instructions were not given to “people”; they were given to monks. So yes, there are some occasions where he would describe meditation to *puthujjanas*, but they had to be monks at least, [because there can be no right *samādhi* for those who, on top of not having the Right View, still live enjoying sensual pleasures.](https://suttacentral.net/mn125/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=main&notes=asterisk&highlight=true&script=latin#7.2)

    In some cases, presumably when the Buddha knew that they had already [covered the required bases.](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an5.114)

    Some examples are [SN 47.4](https://suttacentral.net/sn47.4/en/bodhi?lang=en&reference=none&highlight=true) and [SN 35.71](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.71/en/bodhi?lang=en). Still, those instances are not what most people would understand by “meditation”, i.e., a mechanical concentration practice. He’s telling them to *try to understand* fundamental aspects of the Dhamma directly linked to the Four Noble Truths, which is the only thing that can give rise to the Right View.

    And in all accounts in the Suttas where someone becomes a *sotāpanna,* no concentration practice is ever mentioned, but only the taming of the mind through virtue and seeing the danger in sensuality, and then the Four Noble Truths once that’s sufficiently established.

    Most certainly. Anapanasati especially was only taught to monks, and requires a great deal of wisdom to not be turned into[ wrong meditation](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an11.9).

    The reason why your mind is unruly and is prone to distraction is because of the unwholesome acts you do in your life, not because you’re not aware of your breath. Those actions create the "momentum" that prevents you from completing basic tasks without getting distracted. So if you begin to keep the precepts and restrain your senses, you will address the root cause of your mind’s wildness, instead of applying a topical cream to alleviate its symptoms.

    >  If it's taught to someone and they basically are thinking they only need to mindlessly follow the steps to achieve enlightenment

    The thing is, that attitude goes way deeper than one might think. There are obvious instances of it that many people with common sense could see through, but the root if it remains for whoever hasn't given up sensuality.

    Hence, he may have taught it to monks without the Right View who were well established in virtue (since even being a monk doesn't guarantee that). But not to laypeople who still engaged in sensuality, because they wouldn't be able to help but do it with the same sensual expectations that they still carry and fuel throughout their day.

    >the Buddha ever specify in the suttas that "I am teaching this specifically to monks or laypeople who are sotapana, because otherwise you are not ready."

    In some cases it was implicit, such as when he would say "a learned noble disciple does this". But he did state explicitly that [the noble eightfold path begins with sotāpatti](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=sn55.5). Based on that, the common view that one can practice right mindfulness as a *puthujjana* and become a sotāpanna as a result of it would be incorrect. Instead, you become a sotāpanna by understanding what right mindfulness is, which is inseparably bound up with understanding the Four Noble Truths. Understanding that is always how people entered the stream in the Suttas, and *then* they would be able to meditate correctly without thereby increasing their wrong views further.

    The reason why it’s necessary to state that explicitly is simply because otherwise many people won’t be trying to *understand* and to correct their wrong views. They’ll just keep doing what they’re already doing based on hearsay, tradition, reasoning, and how it makes them feel, hoping that some magical insight will pop up. When it does, they’ll often read the Four Noble Truths into it, meanwhile their views have not changed much at all.

    That's describing Arahantship. After virtue it already says "endowed with this noble aggregate of virtue". A *sotāpanna* is defined in some Suttas as one who has fulfilled virtue.

    That’s managing the suffering by psychologizing it, and that’s not liberation, nor the Right View.

### Rebirth, citta, mano, sankhara

Bhante Anigha,

Following your latest summary post, I was rereading your answer to my question on rebirth and the citta. In it, correct me if I am wrong, you explained that the citta is this second order of experience, the feeling towards feelings, the intention towards intentions, which is not solely physical / biological as choices can be made regarding biological urges. 

Could you elaborate a little on how this description relates to your latest video where you explained, among other things, the difference between citta and mano. If the citta is the intention towards the intention, what is mano in that context? I understood in that conversation that the citta was more passive and mano active. 

Finally, how is mano/citta related to "when avijja ceases, sankhara ceases". How should sankhara be understood here and how does it relate to citta/mano? What does it mean for sankhara to cease? 

Thank you 🙏

    >Could you elaborate a little on how this description relates to your latest video where you explained, among other things, the difference between citta and mano. If the citta is the intention towards the intention, what is mano in that context? I understood in that conversation that the citta was more passive and mano active.

    *mano* in the context of that discussion refers to choice/action, not to the mere cognizing of mental phenomena. It’s the third in the common categorization of action in the Suttas: bodily, verbal, and mental.

    So, the *citta* exhibits certain inclinations and pressures influenced by your past choices from this life and before, but ultimately, you’re always responsible for your *present* choice to go along with that or not, so that’s all that really matters. By making the right choices of restraint and renunciation now, the *citta* is tamed, which is how you overcome sensuality and aversion. But that’s not the Dhamma yet; it’s only the basis for it.

    >Finally, how is mano/citta related to "when avijja ceases, sankhara ceases". How should sankhara be understood here and how does it relate to citta/mano?

    Understanding the complete cessation of *all* choices, even the right ones—which of course doesn’t mean reverting to what you gave up before—is where noble insight lies. *saṅkhāra* means “activity” in the broadest possible sense, and choices are one specific instance of that. Neither *citta* nor *mano* survive the cessation of ignorance: with the cessation of ignorance, *saṅkhāras* cease, and with that, consciousness and *nāmarūpa* all cease.

    >What does it mean for sankhara to cease?

    Pretty much any answer to that question would distract from the fact that it has to be realized for oneself, first and foremost by taming the *citta* through the gradual training, and then, with that purified mind, trying to understand *paṭiccasamuppāda*—in the structural, timeless sense explained in the Suttas, and not the time-bound, sequential “cause-and-effect” or “flux” sense—in your own experience. It is genuinely impossible to imagine it in theory because that very imagination will be affected by ignorance, and will be a *saṅkhāra.*

    It’s also not the sort of magical “cessation experience” you would hear about these days, since ignorance doesn’t need to cease in order for you to have that.

### Questions regarding not trying to get rid of the sense object or trying to cover up pain with "ideas, attitudes, and Information" while trying to restraint. PLEASE HELP!!!!

I understand that in the beginning, I will not be perfect, and I will try to either "overshoot the mark or undershoot the mark" as ajahn always says. I still need advice on this topic so I could be headed in the right direction:

1. when trying to restraint, I always think this: "am i doing this correctly, is this rooted in covering up pain?" and then I often get confused and my mind become relentless. Even when writing this post, I am thinking that my desire for figuring this out and not getting relentless is rooted in sensuality. What should I do about this?
2. When I try to apply some of the concepts that HH talking about: for example, I often hear that my starting point is already rooted in ignorance. Therefore, when I try to restraint, I would question everything because in my mind, I constantly think that I existent is rooted in ignorance. HOWEVER!, I have realized that even thinking that could be used as a technique to manage pain and coverup what is there present in front of me. How should I go about this?
3. when trying to restraint, for example: A lustful thought has arisen. Now, I want to restraint because that lustful thought is captivating and addicting. My restraint would be to kill it, shut it down, and think of it no more. In the place of lustful thought, there would be this darkness and I would just bear pain. IS THIS THE CORRECT WAY? or the second way I tried: I would recognise that lustful thought has arisen. Now I would think "this lustful thought is pressuring because I want this lustful thought" then, I would let to stay there and run as wild without trying to indulge in it and I would bear the pain. Which way is the correct way?
4. when trying to restraint, I do things that feel right. I have realized that I am addicted to having to make sure that everything I do is correct. So when I am trying to restraint, I would do things to "Reveal the pain of my existence" and to avoid swimming too fast, or swimming too slow or trying to stay still when crossing the river. However, this exact attitude leads to my coverup of pain because it provides me with certainty. SO HOW DO I CORRECTLY REVEAL ENDURE AND REVEAL THE PAIN WITHOUT engaging with sensuality on the LEVEL OF ATTITUDE and VIEWS.

THANK YOU bhante. my goal right now is to correctly establish in 5 precepts for life, once I have enough mental strength, then I would go to 8 precepts. But, right now I am too weak!!!

    >my goal right now is to correctly establish in 5 precepts for life, once I have enough mental strength, then I would go to 8 precepts.

    There’s no hope in being able to permanently disentangle yourself from the subtle pressures you’re describing before your virtue is firm and unconditional, as Keller commented.

    Having said that, the problem here isn’t what your mind is projecting it to be, i.e., the sense objects and whether you’re dealing with them the right way or not. It’s the whole framework of doubt that’s pressuring you and making you go around in circles. *That* is a sense object that you’re not properly restrained in regard to, and as a result, the lust and aversion towards other sense objects might even intensify.

    >The reason for doubt is to reveal my intentions behind my actions and question is I am headed in the right path.

    In this case, it’s clear that the questioning is not directed at your actual intention behind the action, since you seem to be overlooking the fact that you’re giving in to pressure in the name of practice.

    If questioning and clarifying is driven by pressure and compulsion, it’s the hindrance of doubt, which obstructs wisdom. The right path is not determined by the content of what you do, but by the absence of craving underneath your present actions. So, *in this situation,* if there is pressure to doubt, not giving in to that is the right path. In another situation, if the pressure is towards being careless and doing whatever feels right at the moment without reflecting, doubting is the right path.

    That’s what it means to see wholesome and unwholesome on the level of your intention, not on the level of external criteria.

### Visiting HH / Samanadipa

This summer, I am going on holiday to Slovenia with my wife and two daughters. This would be a good opportunity for me to visit HH and/or Samanadipa.

To this end, I would have a few questions:

- Is there a a schedule (timetable during the day, certain days of the week, a best time to visite, etc.). Best in the morning ?

- Would it be approriate to come with my wife and daughters (not Buddhist and clueless about it) ? I would think not, but just to make sure. It might be good for my daughters to see Buddhist renunciates, this would be new to them. I would make sure they behave well, but they’re kids. It might be best if they don’t come.

- Is it possible to visit both HH and Samanadipa ?

- Can I make myself useful in any way ? I know there’s often works going on. I would love to contribute if needed / appropriate

- Is there an opportunity to exchange with a monk  ? With the wealth of information here and online, this is not truly necessary, but I don’t get to discuss the Dhamma in person much, especially with people as advanced as the monks at HH / Samanadipa.

    >- Is there a a schedule (timetable during the day, certain days of the week, a best time to visite, etc.). Best in the morning ?

    No. The only thing that happens daily is the meal. Occasionally, there are small jobs to do here and there, usually finished before noon. The best time to visit would be after the meal duties are finished, at around 10AM.

    
    >- Would it be approriate to come with my wife and daughters (not Buddhist and clueless about it) ?

    Not for staying overnight, since we wouldn't have enough rooms, and also because every guest should be a practitioner and keep the eight precepts during their stay.

    They could still come with you on a day trip, although if you really want to discuss Dhamma and not just have a look at the place, it'd probably be better to come by yourself.

    > - Is there an opportunity to exchange with a monk  ?

    Certainly.

    - Is it possible to visit both HH and Samanadipa ?

    HH is in a very remote location, and is reserved for monastics only.

### The deathless (Thanissaro) 

What is your opinion of Thanissaro's description of the deathless in the following video (first 10min):

https://youtu.be/ef1vxDMt-7k?si=8AcqPMTf6t8ocQgI

It sounds to me like he is taking consciousness to be nibbana. Am I missing something? 

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1flgwfh/the_deathless_thanissaro/lo6pc0z/)** _2024-09-21 09:59:16:

    The problem with this view is not only the obvious contradiction of positing *something* that lies outside the five aggregates—whether you call it consciousness or something else doesn’t really matter—but also the implication that Nibbāna is an *experience*. That’s what the Buddha called “conceiving Nibbāna” in MN 1:

    >They perceive Nibbāna as Nibbāna. Having perceived Nibbāna as Nibbāna, they conceive Nibbāna, they conceive in Nibbāna, they conceive apart from Nibbāna, they conceive ‘Nibbāna is mine’, they delight in Nibbāna. Why is that? Because they haven’t fully understood it, I say.

    Nibbāna is not a specific experience; it is the absence of conceiving in regard to *any* experience, and that’s precisely why freedom is possible in the first place. You don’t need to wait for something that takes you outside of what you have now. You need to *fully understand* (which is why the Suttas go on endlessly about understanding this and that) the fundamental nature of whatever you have now. That nature is common to everything else you might experience, including "Nibbāna", precisely by virtue of being experienced.

    Any "outside" you discover is still going to be bound with the same ignorance as everything else, but because all the emphasis is placed on the *contents* of that new experience—its peacefulness, its being "outside of space and time", etc.—you may not realize that. The fact that you're talking about it means you experience(d) it, regardless of how special and extraordinary it is, and thus it is within the aggregates. It is a phenomenon.

    Furthermore, when Nibbāna is (mis)conceived as an experience—a hallmark of wrong view—it follows that something other than the **training** the Buddha outlined,  even in theory, *could* give rise to it, and that all you need to become awakened is to have that experience through any means. This includes meditation techniques, drugs, Tantric practices, koans, etc., and that’s how modern Buddhism has come to be. It’s against the Buddha’s own statement that true knowledge can only arise as a result of gradual training, not abruptly, and that Nibbāna cannot be attained without arduous striving.

    If you fully understand the aggregates—which won’t occur magically from watching your breath and similar practices—nothing will “find a footing” in consciousness anymore, as described at the end of DN 11. That is *viññāṇa anidassana,* which is still *viññāṇa,* and is therefore within the aggregates too (otherwise the Buddha would’ve used a different word). There is no inherent issue with it being so, since the aggregates and ordinary experience are not the source of *dukkha*. Craving is.

    One who fully understands and is free from all passion has no conceiving, appropriation, or delight in regard to ***anything—***[no matter if it's utterly mundane like earth and water, or the most sublime and transcendental experience of "Nibbāna"](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn1#mn1:75.1-mn1:98.4)—and that’s what true Nibbāna is.

    >This requires a willingness to thoroughly abandon passion for any and all forms of consciousness—no matter how luminous or immeasurable—allowing them all to cease

    He's saying that you should abandon passion for all *other* states of consciousness that could be mistakenly regarded as noble attainments. The assumption being that the experience of consciousness without surface he refers to is already free from passion, while in reality, the passion (or rather, delusion, though they're inseparable) is on a much subtler level, and is below the (insufficient) established criteria of what constitutes passion. It's the simple regarding of that experience as somehow safe and trustworthy, as [not a dart, not a disease, not a boil](https://suttacentral.net/sn22.122/en/sujato), and the conceiving (*maññanā*) I referred to above.

    So, I'm afraid this really isn't "the same tree with a different name". It's the same name ("Nibbāna" or "consciousness without surface") being applied to a very different tree, in quite blatant contradiction with the Suttas, and based on the assumption that the Buddha was clumsy with his chosen terminology.

    Glad to hear that you’ve benefitted from my writings.

    >Instead, he says the very opposite: approach any consciousness by the means of “smashing, scattering and demolishing… making it unfit for play.” The only way that this consciousness without surface could undergo this rough treatment he prescribed is if it is not categorized as special when found, but approached in the same way as any other consciousness. 

    It doesn’t really matter how convincingly one argues that that consciousness is free from passion. The main issue is the view that Nibbāna is something you can “find", that it’s some sort of experience you have on one particular occasion, and that this experience qualifies as Nibbāna by virtue of *what it is*, rather than by the absence of conceiving. This view implies that passion towards that experience is there, whether the person realizes it or not.

    The mere act of regarding ***any*** experience as pure and ultimate—even if it’s somehow factually indestructible—makes that experience fabricated and subject to passion, even though one’s definition of what fabrication and passion are may be too narrow to see that. That’s why it would never occur to someone who knows the cessation of fabrication to equate it with a specific experience, and doing so is a hallmark of wrong view, as I wrote above.

    Nibbāna is the [total cessation of all such tendencies for glorification](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=snp4.4), in all possible forms. Not finding safety in anything whatsoever is the only true, unfailing safety. Not regarding anything as pure is the only true purity. When one has fully understood and is steady in that attitude, nothing can find a footing in consciousness, hence it’s “*anidassana”.*

    I'm not necessarily saying that they're not the same. I'm saying that they're not meditative experiences (most especially not the focusing type). They are the perpetual mode of being of an Arahant owing to non-conceiving and dispassion towards all experience whatsoever, and they cannot be arrived at suddenly, but through gradual training. 

    Saying that an experience can be intrinsically pure and unfabricated for anyone who has it is like saying that a sentence can be intrinsically heard by anyone in the vicinity. Fabrication is on "your" side of the equation, not on the side of the experience, and *that's why* Nibbāna cannot be taken away. Not because it's an experience that has indestructibility as an inherent characteristic.

    >Such terminology might seem to give credence to Nibbāna-as-a-special-type-of-consciousness

    Well, I'm not saying it's an ordinary type of consciousness, and that there's no difference between an Arahant's consciousness and a puthujjana's. The point is that consciousness is deprived of surface on account of the all-pervasive absence of passion and presence of knowledge, which is something you *develop*, not something that pops up fortuitously as a result the sort of effort Ven. Thanissaro describes.

    A puthujjana's consciousness can be "luminous"', but never *all around*, since there are dark spots of ignorance that he's not even aware of and thus cannot take into account.

    Exactly, and that's why saying or even indirectly implying that *viññāṇa anidassana* is a specific experience—as opposed to the *manner* in which all experiences, regardless of their particulars, inevitably arise for an Arahant—is a straight contradiction in terms. "I am pure because of *this*".

    Looking at the description in MN 1, you need to start dealing with the grossest level of the problem that you still have, which for most people will be delight, and start undoing it in reverse order.

    Sutta Nipāta 5.5 gives a concise but clear description of the extent to which delight should be abandoned:

    *“Whatever you are aware of—*

    *above, below, across, and in the middle—*

    *having dispelled delight and settling in regard to that,*

    *consciousness will not stand within being (bhava).*

    *A bhikkhu who fares abiding like this,*

    *recollected and diligent, having abandoned appropriations,*

    *would give up birth, aging, and sorrow and lamentation—*

    *suffering—having seen right here.”*

    As always, the obvious first step to that would be virtue and sense restraint.

### Mano/citta and the 5 aggregates

How does mano relate to the five aggregates? Is it the same as sankhara as in intentions/choices ? 

If vitakka is on the level of mano and dhamma on the level of citta, I wonder if the following way of seeing this scenario is correct :

I am talking to someone who mentions a woman I know. I hadn't thought about her in a long time. This sudden mention brings forth thoughts of sensuality in my mind. These images just pop up on their own. They're dhammas. There is this sudden moment when I realise that thoughts of sensuality are present. There is also this pressure being felt to consciously go with them, to proliferate them. That is vittaka. This is where my mental sense restraint kicks in. I endure the desire to actively think about this woman and do not fuel these dhammas. 

It's not easy to see the difference between the two because, in my experience, when thoughts appear there is this initial moment of identification. It's like all there is is these thoughts, I am these thoughts. They're my entire experience. Then sudden realisation comes that it's just thoughts having appeared. I am not these thoughts, they are not mine. Like waking up from a dream. But there is pressure to continue to day dream. Is it at this moment that sense restraint should kick in and where dhammas are differentiated from vittaka or has the ship long sailed and I missed the initial opportunity for sense restraint and I am now only catching up with my own negligence?

    Yes, that sounds right. You don’t give in to them, but you don’t act like you’re in control of their arising either. That’s how you "destroy" an arisen *kāmavitakka*, while the enticing *dhamma* remains, as a poisonous drink that you’ve refused.

### What’s the alternative to willpower?

For reference, I am a lay steward in a monastery. 

Throughout my time in various monasteries, I have watched many people, especially young men, come to monasteries perhaps a bit over-enthused by things like dutangas, and ready to ordain despite only having practiced for a very short time. I have frequently seen (and myself had) an attitude that seems like bhava tanha, with the idealization of masculinity and of “toughness”, commonly seen for example in certain sports like ultra marathon runners, praised for their grit and determination. Eventually I see most of these characters, typically the ones most excited by ascetic practice and most strict, falling back into sense pleasures. They find their attitude unsustainable. Many of them never come back. Occasionally, one will stay on- like myself. In my current location I find myself surrounded by gentle, humble, and fluid (flexible?) folks, yet most of them keep their virtue beautifully.

I feel confident to say that willpower is a finite resource. Willpower even changes depending on our circumstance, like if we have low blood sugar, bad sleep, etc etc. This is a well studied phenomenon (though I suppose science is limited in its objective and external takes.) Now I’ve asked this question of a lot of teachers in the Thai Forest, with fascinating, useful, and varied responses. However I’m curious what I might find here. So what, then is the alternative? What is superior to willpower, less finite, more sustainable, more accessible?

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1fjnphj/whats_the_alternative_to_willpower/lnqo3m1/)** _2024-09-18 14:43:35:

    >What is superior to willpower, less finite, more sustainable, more accessible?

    A sense of being under genuine threat, regardless of whether you even know about the Dhamma or not. That is why in the Suttas, the recognition that precedes the undertaking of the training is "I am prey to suffering, mired in suffering," and it's when monks forgot that was the reason for their going forth that they would become careless.

    We are all in exactly the same situation of being prey to suffering. It's just that some people feel compelled to do something about it[ even though nothing particularly bad has happened to them personally](https://suttacentral.net/an4.113/en/sujato?lang=en), while others can't be bothered to honestly recognize the gravity of their situation despite the worst misfortunes, and despite hearing the Dhamma. Thus, they remain distracted by the joys and pleasures of the near shore until the tiger comes and eats them at last.

    So if the practice feels like it requires willpower, the most a person could do is clarify the danger of their current state. For a person who truly sees that danger, *not practicing* is what would require willpower (strictly speaking, it wouldn’t even be possible, since willpower only makes sense when you genuinely expect a future benefit to come out of a present action).

    >especially young men, come to monasteries perhaps a bit over-enthused by things like dutangas, and ready to ordain despite only having practiced for a very short time.

    Yes, and that's why dhutangas should ideally be taken on only with the Right View. They're not magical vows that will purify your mind regardless of the tangle of wrong views and misguided attitudes that you carry. Once you're able to reliably read your own mind, you can do them if it's apparent that they'll help you abandon that which you recognize as unwholesome with full certainty.

    To reach that point though, the precepts are not negotiable, and uncompromisingly keeping even the 8 precepts is never "self-mortification". Introducing further external observances than that out of various wrong views is what is.

    ...  
    I worry that spending too much time reflecting in this way without the balance of practices that point toward contentment

    The right contentment will be possible when you eradicate your mind’s tendency to recoil from what is nothing other than the truth (the ever-looming possibility of death, ultimately). It’s the contentment of no longer holding to anything that death or loss can take away, thus being beyond the *liability* to worry, not just free from worry at that moment. That’s the wholesome joy of renunciation, and any other form of joy is within sensuality.

    Sure enough, that doesn’t mean you need to take on the entire weight of anxiety all at once. You can do it gradually. But don’t fool yourself into thinking that looking away from the problem somehow helps you fix it, which is what people usually mean with "contentment" and "joyful practice".

### What is the difference between "hindrance" vs "fetter"?

I was listening to the recent YouTube video on "Q&A - Freedom through the Right precepts", and around the [51:32 mark](https://youtu.be/wPr59OHLcrk?si=6XyHXC3rfomQJsVK&t=3092), Ajahn Nanamoli was talking about hindrance vs fetter, but I'm still not really following, other than the point that hindrances are more "fundamental", and hence fetters fall off first.  Can someone please clarify?  Thank you!

    An important difference would be that you have no direct input on the fetters, whereas the entire practice—the whole Gradual Training going from virtue to jhānas—takes place with reference to the five hindrances. Those are the pressuring, unwholesome mental states that you can be presently aware of and not give in to, and doing that sufficiently weakens the fetters.

### Does the Buddha recommend the eight precepts?

For the monks the Buddha says follow the Pāṭimokkha.  For lay followers he says the five precepts (with extra right speech sometimes).  The only place I see the eight precepts is on the uposatha.  Is that correct?

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1fj17ig/does_the_buddha_recommend_the_eight_precepts/lnqtpyz/)** _2024-09-18 15:13:31:

    > For lay followers he says the five precepts (with extra right speech sometimes).

    But does he ever *say* that by keeping just the five precepts, a lay follower who doesn’t see the Dhamma will eventually come to see it, or was he just telling that to [people who were likely only interested in ensuring a good rebirth](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn41) with the least possible amount of effort in this life? When the audience was made up of those who regarded themselves as trainees practicing to make further progress even though they were laypeople, they were instructed to practice like monks. In [MN 53](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn53), this is compared to a hen who properly sits on her eggs so that her chicks will eventually hatch.

    There is no recorded instance in the Suttas of a layperson hearing the Dhamma for the first time, failing to attain Right View on that very occasion, being instructed to observe only the five precepts, and later becoming a *sotāpanna* on the basis of that, which is how people today often hope their practice will unfold. Laypeople who attained Right View were those whose minds were already ripe to realize the Dhamma on the very first encounter, even though externally they had been leading normal lives: their eggs were already on the verge of hatching before meeting the Buddha. Everybody else needs to be "sitting on their eggs" for a good while if awakening is what they’re after, [and that requires giving up sensuality](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn36#mn36:17.11-mn36:17.13), even if they still have a job and are externally a "householder".

    >However, before going down this path doesn't the Buddha tell the person to shave his head, wear a robe, and leave all possessions and family/friends behind?

    Yes, that seems to be the case. That’s because back then, if someone truly wanted to realize the Dhamma, they wouldn’t have stayed living at home in the first place, so it’s natural that there are hardly any examples of lay renunciates in the Suttas. Hence, all the discourses that deal with profound Dhamma and things like jhānas were given to monks, or to already-attained laypeople in some cases.

    Remaining a householder, even while observing the 8 precepts, is somewhat of a compromise in terms of its potential to ripen the mind. However, it is the most realistic path for most people today, and with several years of diligence, it would be sufficient. Not because going forth today is necessarily more cumbersome than it was back then (often it’s the opposite: thanks to social insurance programs in many countries and higher overall safety, your family usually won’t die), but because people’s faculties are generally weaker, and they are more attached to comfort, safety, and certainty, not only to pure sensuality. Granted, few monasteries today are even suitable for practice, whereas back then basically every monastery was.

    >Would you say that is mostly kammic/innate or due to environment/education?

    That’s not really a valid dichotomy. Your environment cannot have an influence on your mind in a fundamental way except through the intentions that you exert in regard to it. In other words, everyone is entirely responsible for where their mind is currently at in terms of greed, aversion, and delusion.

    >I wonder if there's an opportunity for skillful practice here or one should just stick to precepts + speech guidelines and then the rest of the gradual training.

    If keeping the 8 precepts without fail until your last breath has become a trivial matter, then you can consider taking on dhutaṅgas. Otherwise, it will be a distraction from your incomplete restraint in the areas that are way more significant.

### Is the Puthujjana's meditation mere confinement?

I have noticed a recent trend in most modern meditation instruction which tries to "sell you" their specific brand or technique by emphasizing the pleasure of meditation. Either that pleasure is supposed to be immediate ("meditation should be fun", "you should want to meditate") or comes about as a consequence of diligent practice ("this method will eventually lead to jhana, which are very pleasurable states", "meditation will eventually increase your baseline happiness"). If this is not always stated so explicitly at the outset there remains a lingering assumption, at the very least on the part of the practitioners, that meditation should lead to pleasure.

Yet, it seems to me that for a puthujjana (or rather for a mind which has not been sufficiently tamed), meditation should be an utterly terrifying prospect. It is comparable to solitary confinement in prison--often considered the worst possible punishment--yet even more severe because the confinement not only requires that you keep the body still (thereby becoming like the confinement of a paraplegic), but extends even to the mind. You are not allowed to "escape" the pain of confinement via day-dreaming, sleeping, planning, or yes, even meditation techniques.

One measures progress in such meditation not so much by advancement through some series of pleasurable or esoteric experiences but by how much the mind still thrashes around when it is confined and how long it can endure that confinement.

Seen this way, meditation seems to be a form of "death before dying". And it is easy to see how the mind would be strengthened from such an undertaking, how the pressure of the everyday baits of Mara in the world would begin to pale in comparison to this self-imposed exlie. If this confinement were made into an inescapable fact of one's life (as indeed it's greater cousin, death, surely is) then it's also easy to see how sensuality would soon become burning coals, extortion, danger. One could not engage carelessly  with them any longer, knowing how much the greater the torment will be when it comes time for the daily confinement.

Is this the right way of thinking about and practicing meditation? How does one avoid crossing the threshold into self-mortification with this line of thought (if it hasn't been crossed already)?

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1fijs91/is_the_puthujjanas_meditation_mere_confinement/lnkmtsh/)** _2024-09-17 14:08:49:

    >How does one avoid crossing the threshold into self-mortification with this line of thought (if it hasn't been crossed already)?

    By not turning it into just another mindless "method," and keeping in mind that you still need to remain aware of your intention behind that practice at all times. Otherwise, you might be thinking you're practicing the right "confinement" and so on, but internally, what you're really doing is acting out of aversion and wrong view, which means there's no confinement in the true sense.

    Ironically, saying no to everything is actually easier than keeping an eye on your intentions and restraining them on the right level because you're still to an extent running with the momentum of your mind, just in a different direction. You're still going with the grain.

    There will be many times where, indeed, the right thing to do is to tie down the mind because *right now* it's trying to go where it shouldn't (sensual pleasures, irritation, or distractions). But really, [you only need to prevent it from going *there*](http://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=sn35.246), not from moving altogether.

    People naturally crave the safety of something they can "just do" every time, without any need for consideration. That leads to overlooking the fact that—apart from the precepts, which are carved in stone—restraint is to be done in relation to *presently arisen* unwholesome intentions that are being recognized, and not in relation to a predetermined list of things that are always bad (which will often be what people default to when they hear about "confinement"). Such a list could be infinitely expanded since the defilements will always manage to shift elsewhere. Every time something goes wrong, you would assume that *that action* was the problem, so it must be added to the list.

    The latter attitude is what results in frustration and the unbeneficial pain of self-mortification: you're overlooking your own mind and are instead proceeding mechanically, [like the unskilled cook](http://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=sn47.8).

    So, contrary to popular belief, it would be self-mortification not because you're "too restrained" and you need to make way for a bit of pleasure (which would inevitably be sensual pleasure), but because you're not restrained on the right level and with right understanding.

    The *same* practice of right restraint would become pleasant when your mind [no longer values what you're saying no to](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an9.41#an9.41:7.2-an9.41:7.15) and sees giving it up as true safety, not when you intentionally fabricate pleasure through some other means. You don’t need to be fabricating pain either, for that matter. The criterion for rightness must be that defilements are being consciously given up, not how you currently feel.

### Would Venerable Anigha give some words on craving? 

If the Venerable were to give some words on craving, may he answer in any way. I'd be very grateful for the guidance. 

By possesing what internal weaknesses do we allow craving to ensnare us? By possesing which internal strengths could we evade it? 

Upon becoming aware of the ensnarer in the background, what attitude should we develop towards it?  

Once having eaten the bait, ensnared by craving, how could we become aware of our predicament, and avoid further pain, so as to quickly recuperate? And what attitude should we posses to not repeat the mistake of becoming ensnared?

As long as one's day contains what attitudes, would a discriminating follower of the Tathagata, weaken craving? 

As long as one maintains what internal spirit, would a discriminating follower of the Tathagata, endure the long drawn out battle against craving without his effort slacking or diminishing completely?

    >By possessing what external weaknesses do we allow craving to ensnare us?

    Ignorance (of what craving is).

    >By possessing which internal strengths could we evade it?

    Knowledge (of what craving is).

    It’s more important to remember that, prior to *sotāpatti*, one still doesn’t understand what craving truly is, than to focus on trying to give it up. The latter would only rely on and take for granted one’s current, inaccurate understanding of the problem.

    >As long as one's day contains what attitudes, would a discriminating follower of the Tathagata, weaken craving?

    The attitude of relentlessly trying to understand, and seeing that as the practice, rather than the attitude of seeking a fixed method of practice that will absolve you from trying to understand.

    [A puthujjana cannot perfectly avoid everything that’s unwholesome ](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an2.11-20#an2.11:1.1-an2.11:2.6)since that requires understanding craving and its cessation, but what he can reliably do is abandon all deliberate misconduct of body, speech, and mind. Within that, the effort of “trying to understand” comes in, namely, a consistent attempt to remind oneself and to recognize on even subtler levels that unwholesomeness is fundamentally determined by the internal pressure that motivates the action, and not by the external criteria related to the action itself, such as the letter of the precepts, what the action resulted in, the opinions of others, how you feel, what you were told you should do even by your own teacher, etc.

    >Once having eaten the bait, ensnared by craving, how could we become aware of our predicament, and avoid further pain, so as to quickly recuperate? And what attitude should we posses to not repeat the mistake of becoming ensnared?

    A sense of urgency, coupled with the firm conviction that freedom from suffering is the only thing that truly matters in this life—and the terror of dying without having attained the Right View—would ensure that you always get up quickly as possible whenever you fall, and would hopefully prevent you from falling as much in the first place as well. However, undaunted perseverance is more important than how many times you fail, as not getting up after one fall is all it takes to fail completely.

### Who are the ariyasāvakas?

Hello everyone, is there any conclusive interpretation of what ariyasāvaka means in the suttas?
Is there a meaningful distinction to be made with sutavā ariyasāvaka? Or has there been some sort of study on the ways these phrases are used?

It does seem to make a meaningful difference in interpretation: (learned) disciple of the noble ones has very different implications than (learned) noble disciple. 

Thank you for any light you could shed on this. 

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1fgc0ir/who_are_the_ariyasāvakas/ln23bf1/)** _2024-09-14 08:46:56:

    In contexts where it’s just "*ariyasāvaka",* and not *sutavā ariyasāvaka* contrasted with *assutavā* *puthujjana*, it’s technically possible for it to mean anyone who is devoted to the Buddha’s teaching (e.g., AN 7.69). Accordingly, such instances don’t explicitly attribute any significant insight or development to the *ariyasāvaka* simply by virtue of being one.

    But whenever *sutavā ariyasāvaka* is contrasted with *assutavā puthujjana*, [e.g., the Arrow Sutta](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=sn36.6), it’s a categorical divide between the 8 types of noble individuals and everyone else. Hence it’s said that the former is skilled and trained in the teaching of the noble ones, while the latter isn’t.

    Part of the confusion is also due to the fact that when the Buddha was alive, being wholeheartedly devoted to his teaching very often would’ve meant being at least a faith-follower, and so these two "types" of *ariyasāvaka* would’ve overlapped almost totally. There was little to no room for misinterpretation or counterfeits.

    Today, however, much what is presented as the Buddha’s teachings[ bears only a very superficial resemblance](https://suttacentral.net/sn16.13/en/bodhi?lang=en&reference=main&highlight=false), if any, to what’s found in the Suttas, so even the deepest devotion to what the majority of Buddhists regard as true Dhamma would not make one a faith-follower.

### Seeing things as things 

All things stand on equal footing, that is to say they are manifest. What ever is does not reach beyond that. What ever seems otherwise is not seen in its nature rather it's content is taken to be that which it implies.

For some time I have been trying to understand yoniso manasikara yet whatever attempt I made it was just another liner investigation assuming what is to be understood is at the end of that investigation. Overlooking what is and what could not be otherwise is already right here.

I am wondering is this what is meant by "seeing a thing as a thing" phenomenology or yoniso manasikara?

    >I am wondering is this what is meant by "seeing a thing as a thing" phenomenology or yoniso manasikara?

    Yes. The key is that it needs to be applied to the things that you are attached to and regard as "special", such as your sense of self, people and things who are dear to you, views that you hold, feelings that you want to keep enduring, ambitions, etc. Those are the things that your mind *doesn’t want* to treat as things, but as somehow "more" than that, because then their impermanence (and thus suffering) becomes apparent.

    On the other hand, the mind has no problem acknowledging random sense objects as just things, so contemplating that is of no real use.

    >So could it be said that it's about maintaining the perspective rather than seeking these things out which are dear?

    It’s not that you have to "seek them out". They will arise on their own sooner or later, and you want to make sure that you don’t fall away from the attitude of seeing *them too* as phenomena. And the measure for when something is made into "more" than just a phenomenon is when you act out of it, not when it’s merely pressuring you to do so.

    At certain times, if it seems like the mind is mostly calm and established in the context, you can make effort to bring to mind those things that would tend to threaten/pressure it (i.e., that it wants to treat as more than just phenomena, not on equal footing as everything else). If it gets perturbed, then it wasn’t the right type of calm. But, you can strive towards it by seeing *that perturbation* as a phenomenon, without trying to suppress it.

    Right equanimity is when *the mind* is, as the Suttas say, "boundless". The mind cannot be toppled by whichever phenomena arise, even if one wishes it, while the phenomena themselves remain the same as they were before. Wrong equanimity is making everything "smaller" (i.e., less pressuring), or even non-existent, so that it no longer challenges the mind, and that’s what you get out of most mainstream meditation practices.

### Is this enough to make any eventual headway in renunciation?

I posted yesterday about my long standing addiction to distraction (watching videos online) and lying in bed for hours. Today after coming home from work, I decided I would make myself do things in order to not fall into the "I'm so tired from work and all I can do is lie down now" trap again. So, I took a shower and did some cleaning. 

I still ended up watching internet videos, but did not allow myself to do so while lying in bed, but only while I was cleaning and sitting on the floor. I was thinking that I can try to make gradual changes to eventually break the behavior pattern I feel stuck in, and my first step could be to not lie down in bed except for when I am going to sleep in the evening. I also will not watch any shows while I'm in bed.

Is this too small of a step to even be counted as moving in the right direction? I sort of feel like I'm just negotiating with the addiction, but I also am finding it super uncomfortable to really consider just stopping cold turkey. I realize how much I've become attached to the pacification of the videos and the way that they consume my time so I don't have to feel very uncomfortable or bored.

    There are apps for computers and smartphones that allow you to set a block on certain websites. You could try that.

    It will be unpleasant for sure, but that’s when all the teachings of the Suttas cease to be abstract information, and become presently applicable. That’s when you have to start contemplating the danger in sensuality, the lack of satisfaction, how fruitless every instance of indulgence in the past has been, the goal of peace and enlightenment that all of these habits are obstructing, etc. These contemplations won’t be a magic fix, but if you persist in them *within the unconditional renunciation,* at some point in time the mind will have to start listening. But if you let it have what it wants, you have to restart the taming all over again. Just like a wild animal.

    It means you determine to make no exceptions, regardless of how you feel or the situation you find yourself in, once you’ve decided to start keeping a precept or to give up an unwholesome habit. You can’t give something up "part-time".

    That’s why it’d be better to take on fewer precepts, but do so *for life,* than to go from no precepts to 8 precepts on retreat or on special occasions. The latter doesn’t even count as virtue.

### Feeling tired as an excuse

I've been in this pattern now for maybe a year or more, where I feel exhausted and then I just basically become really lazy and give up on my intentions of practicing renunciation. This is in regards to over indulging in sleep or relaxation (like just laying around basically) and that leads to entertainment. I suppose I realize that the only way to get out of this pattern is to stop playing it out every time the tiredness or exhaustion arises, but it's like a whole chain or set of behaviors that seem to just play out.

 I'm sure there is a moment there when I decide to give in, because I often am aware of that moment. But even though it looks like a choice to give in or not give in, it always \*feels\* impossible not to give in when I'm in that moment. Afterwards, I think oh I shouldn't have given in again.  And beforehand I think, when I feel tired later, I will not give in this time. But... I always do. 

I feel like I've made zero progress on the path for a long time, and sort of don't know what to do in order to progress more anyway. I keep the 5 precepts, I am committed to celibacy for life and am making really good progress with refraining from masturbation, which when I first decided to be celibate for life, I was masturbating almost weekly. But that is no longer the case, and even though desires come up now and then, I am much more able to refrain from acting on them. (I'm sorry if that is too much personal information).

  
I used to meditate a lot and every day. But I have stopped for a while because of doubt. Doubt in the methods, doubt in my ability, doubt that I am doing something beneficial when I meditate, and doubt that it will actually lead anywhere beyond a temporary good feeling while I'm doing it and shortly after. 

The path seems very hard now. I see my main work as developing more in renunciation, but I feel like I'm not good at it, and am probably lying to myself often about how committed I truly am. I also want there to be more than the practice of refraining from things and restraining my senses. I want the calm and pleasant and sometimes intense experiences that meditation brings. But I struggle to really maintain a regular practice for the same reason that I struggle to keep to renunciation and the 8 precepts... I just get very tired and decide to lay around instead. I would like some advice on how to move forward so I don't just die with this being the farthest I've gotten on the path. I'm tired of vacillating between decisions (meditation or no meditation, one method or the other, working to keep the 8 precepts or not push that hard yet).

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1fer47p/feeling_tired_as_an_excuse/lmr16ov/)** _2024-09-12 11:40:02:

    >I'm sure there is a moment there when I decide to give in, because I often am aware of that moment. But even though it looks like a choice to give in or not give in, it always \*feels\* impossible not to give in when I'm in that moment.

    That’s quite a common pattern, and it always has the same cause: you have been making careless choices in the recent past that have made your mind incline more strongly towards further carelessness. There is not much that you can really do at that moment except dig in your heels and not give in. The aim should be to not end up in that situation *in the first place,* and you do so by being even more watchful of your choices the next time, long before such coarse tendencies towards unwholesomeness arise.

    You mentioned the five precepts and celibacy, but are you fully restrained from all forms of distraction and entertainment? If not, that would explain the issue.

    >Doubt in the methods, doubt in my ability, doubt that I am doing something beneficial when I meditate, and doubt that it will actually lead anywhere beyond a temporary good feeling while I'm doing it and shortly after.

    That’s good. You should start seeing value in taming your mind, not in drugging it temporarily.

    >. I also want there to be more than the practice of refraining from things and restraining my senses. I want the calm and pleasant and sometimes intense experiences that meditation brings.

    That’s a false dichotomy.[ As the Suttas often show](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=sn35.97#sn35.97:2.2-sn35.97:2.19), the right calm and joy is born out of nothing other than successful restraint. The caveat is that successful restraint requires discernment of one’s intentions, and it cannot be achieved by simply following somebody else’s instructions. Apart from the precepts, which are unconditional, you need to see for yourself what is rooted in defilements *for you* at any given time, even at the level of mental choices.

    Also, the emphasis should not be in what extraordinary experiences the practice will give rise to, but in freeing yourself from all craving (which is the right type of pleasure).  The orgasmic experiences that most people think are *samādhi* and *jhāna* have nothing to do with what the Buddha taught, which always centers around dispassion and relinquishment.

### Provoking the right anxiety

u/Bhikkhu_Anigha

Hello Bhante,

With the gradual upgradation of virtue, and tightening of restraint - and provoking the right anxiety of the impermanence of practically everything - there has been a cloud of unease thickly permeating everyday experience.

As my practice has involved extended periods of dwelling in solitude, with little to no distraction - there is a heightened sense that there is 'nowhere to run to' to escape this. I know there are things I could do to 'take my mind off it', but it is amply clear to me that doing so is unjustified and senseless. I don't experience a pressing desire to make it go away (have got quite used to it being a periodic occurance), but there isn't a nonchalant ease in staying with it either.

So for the past many days, there has been this 'stewing' in a general anxious unease / nervous energy - that anything can give at any point; and literally no-one can be safely depended on. The profound weight of the factual loneliness of every individual, has been bearing down on me.

I was reading Ajahn Chah's account in *Stillness Flowing,* where he describes a certain experience

>Then, after a while, I started to weep. It just happened by itself. Tears started to roll down my face. Before that I’d been thinking how like an orphan I was, sitting there shivering in the middle of the pouring rain. I thought that probably none of the people happily asleep in their houses would imagine that there was a monk sitting out here in the rain all night; they were probably snuggling up in their warm blankets. ‘And here I am, sitting here, soaked to the skin – what’s it all about?’ As I started dwelling on those thoughts a sense of the sorrowfulness of my life arose, and I began to cry. The tears were streaming down: ‘That’s alright, it’s bad stuff. Let it all run out until there’s none left.’ That’s what practice is.

As I was reading, I could very closely relate to what he meant - and there was a spontaneous outpouring of tears in me, at the thought of what Ajahn must've been through, and at my own present state.

I wonder if there is something you might say regarding tuning my practice, to 'deal' with these circumstances in the right manner.

Thanks in advance !

    There isn’t really anything special that you need to do.

    > I know there are things I could do to 'take my mind off it', but it is amply clear to me that doing so is unjustified and senseless.

    Keep making sure that you act in line with that clarity.

    The goal is not to make any of that anxiety and displeasure go away, but to fully understand, *while it is there*, that that’s not what suffering is. Then, the anxiety "remains", but when you’re no longer trying to wriggle out of it, it’s not anxiety anymore, and it’s not unpleasant. It’s just the inherent, inescapable uncertainty of existence.

    That’s what the Buddha meant with neutral feeling being unpleasant if not understood.

    Partially, although it's the part people would tend to lack the most due to their unrestrained lifestyle, in which either full-on pleasure or some form distraction or engagement is sought at every turn.

    >I was instructed to go into non-activity and dive into the neutral feeling

    Yes, that's not wrong. But you want to come face to face with the neutral feeling and stop resisting it only to eventually become dispassionate towards it too. It's better than the other two because it doesn't partake in sensuality and aversion, [but it's still unsafe](https://suttacentral.net/sn36.5/en/bodhi?lang=en&reference=none&highlight=true).

    >But what would understanding gratification, danger, and escape from neutral feelings free me from and how is that relevant to the right view?

    It would free you from appropriation of those feelings. You don't start with a pure mind that then starts taking things as "mine"; mine-making is already there perpetually, always in relation to something. So anything that you don't see clearly can become a basis for the assumption of self, and that in itself is a problem, even if that thing is not as harmful as sensuality.

    It's because they couldn't see [neutral feeling too](https://suttacentral.net/sn36.5/en/bodhi?lang=en&reference=none&highlight=false) as impermanent, suffering, and not-self that the few members of other sects in the Buddha's time that had developed *samādhi* were ultimately still *puthujjanas*.

    >So, if craving ceases, does phassa just become "contact" because there is no longer a self that is pressured by it?

    There is a reason why the Buddha made no concessions, and instead of saying something along the lines of "X experience of a puthujjana becomes Y in the Arahant", he instead said that all of those things, including consciousness and all the other aggregates, *cease* when ignorance ceases. That’s because one cannot even abstractly imagine what Arahantship is like (accurately) while still being a puthujjana. Nibbāna is the cessation of a puthujjana’s entire existence.

### Teachings of Thanissaro Bhikkhu

I often listen to dhamma talks by Thanissaro Bhikkhu and I have practiced his meditation methods in the past (though not regularly). Does he stay pretty consistent with the suttas when he speaks about Dhamma? I have only just begun reading the suttas on my own, and have to admit that they are difficult to understand unless I spend additional time finding online talks explaining them afterwards.

    >Does he stay pretty consistent with the suttas when he speaks about Dhamma?

    Only on rather superficial, theoretical points, and not when it comes to the actual practice.

    >and have to admit that they are difficult to understand

    That happens mainly due to lack of development on one's part. The main basis for understanding them rightly is not someone else's explanations, but adopting the lifestyle and values that they put forward.

### Can I please get some honest feedback on something I likely am not seeing clearly?

This has to do with the 6th precept and observing it "to the letter" vs "in spirit" and I'm sorry but it's a long post:

I had an eating disorder (anorexia) for over ten years but have stopped engaging in it for a little over two years now. But when I try and observe the 6th precept as eating only before noon, and I get hungry in the evening, I begin to notice what are like echoes or a return of that old disordered process coming back up (as in similar thought patterns are present). It seems like unnecessary restriction for the sake of following a rule. Most of the eating disorder was comprised of obsession with following rules that I would set for myself around food, and then a great deal of anxiety, remorse, fear, and self-loathing if I broke the rules. I also would use the feeling of hunger and the act of not alleviating it as a way to punish myself, and at other times as a way to cope with anxiety and anger.

I don't have this inner struggle when I'm staying at a monastery and keeping the 6th precept, because I'm in an environment where food is just not available in the evening. So I know it isn't the hunger that is triggering the aversion, rather it's the fact that I feel hungry, I have food available, but am not allowing myself to relieve that hunger. Everything in my mind tells me in that moment that what I'm doing is self-destructive and wrong. 

I have never seen a mental health professional, but I stopped engaging with the eating disorder on my own because over time the things that motivated me to do it were not present anymore. Mostly, the high level of anxiety and self-hatred are no longer present in my mind. I also saw how what I believed to be a solution to a problem was in fact just another problem. When I was undertaking a lot of vipassana practice, I sat down to meditate one day and a thought of "look what you are doing to yourself" came up  and  I started breaking down crying wondering how I could be hurting myself so much for so long. Since that time, it's as if my mind just completely let go of the disorder and could never again pick it back up.

This brings me back to what I currently struggle with in regards to considering how I observe moderation in eating. I believe that eating only when I am trying to alleviate hunger would be the most clear-cut approach. Eating out of craving for a taste or experience, would not be moderation in eating, but indulgence in sense pleasure. But actively setting up the conditions for myself to experience prolonged hunger and intentionally not alleviating that hunger, causes me to recoil and there's something like a psychological block that is not allowing me to do this. I also see the cut off time as rather arbitrary and my desire to observe it as possibly an over attachment to a rule. 

Then, there are also thoughts that arise around this like, "other people are able to fast but I can't because I'm too weak" or "I used to be better at going hungry, but now I can't therefore I'm not as good as I used to be" - these types of ego-driven thoughts are also reminiscent of my eating disorder and I do not want to be entertaining them or giving into them, all for the sake of checking a box and saying, "yes I can keep the 8 precepts."

I'm asking if it seems like there is something going on that I should be trying to see and work out by allowing myself to be hungry in the evening? Again, I see that it isn't purely the hunger that I am averse to because I can go hungry when there isn't food available and be okay with that. The aversion is coming from the act of denying myself food that is available when I feel hungry. I would appreciate your honest thoughts and suggestions.

I also apologize if this was not the most coherent and well organized post. I was trying to be concise and share what I think is important in working through this decision on how to move forward with my sense restraint/renunciation.

    See MN 70, which gives the account of the Buddha introducing the rule of not eating after noon, and shows that the purpose of it is not solely to avoid burdening the laity. Eating only in one part of the day, which can involve putting up with some amount of hunger, does have to do with the training of the mind.

    The disorder that you describe is something that used to involve your deliberate intention, so while certain thoughts and pressures might come up now as a result of those past actions, for as long as *now* you don’t intentionally welcome those thought patterns, there is no problem. Consider them as flies that are buzzing around you looking for something suitable to feed on. If you don’t give them anything, they will eventually leave.

    But if you just ignore the issue and continue to make effort in other tangential directions, you will have turned away from the dimension of development that’s truly important.

    >So I know it isn't the hunger that is triggering the aversion, rather it's the fact that I feel hungry, I have food available, but am not allowing myself to relieve that hunger. Everything in my mind tells me in that moment that what I'm doing is self-destructive and wrong.

    The purpose of the rules is to expose the wild tendencies of your mind so that you can tame them. It doesn’t really matter why or in what way that defiance manifests, and what reasoning is there to justify not keeping the rule; what matters is that there is resistance one way or another, which wouldn’t be there for a mind that is pliable and workable (which is what *samādhi* is).

    Actually being established in virtue and sense restraint would result in *sotāpatti* before it results in jhānas, so that should be the goal.

    Prior to attaining Right View, even if one is perfectly virtuous and restrained, it’s almost certain that one will misconceive what Ānāpānasati is about and fall into wrong *samādhi* ([absorption/concentration](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an11.9)), more so than with all the other approaches the Buddha taught.

    He described Ānāpānasati as "the dwelling of a noble one" (*ariyavihāro).*

    >does absorption/concentration only happen to someone who does not have Right View? Is that in itself a sign that someone is not a stream enterer yet?

    If someone values it and cultivates it with the idea that it’s useful on the path to awakening, then yes, they are both far from and actively moving further away from the Right View (managing feelings instead of understanding how to uproot craving).

    >Can you please explain a little more what this means from the sutta you linked?

    In essence, it means that right meditation is not about keeping your attention on something, but about the attitude your mind has while attending to whatever you are attending. When that attitude is purified from the five hindrances, *what* you attend to is completely irrelevant; hence, you wouldn’t meditate in dependence of anything specific.

    In contrast, wrong meditation is about keeping your attention on something that happens not to arouse the five hindrances. The *liability* to the five hindrances is not being addressed at all, which is why the mind needs to stay locked in that space indefinitely. It’s like locking up a wild beast (your own mind) in a cage so it can’t attack people, rather than domesticating it so it won’t harm anyone even when roaming freely (which is how the Suttas actually describe *samādhi).*

    > Is this a purely intellectual "knowing" -always able to be explained verbally, or could it also be on the level of perceiving suffering in what one is engaging in, so automatically avoiding that thing, like the way one would just naturally move their body further away from a fire that they need to walk past when they are getting too close and feeling an intense burning?

    It’s both. If it’s purely intellectual and has no bearing on your choices and mental states, then it’s just information. If it’s purely "intuitive" and you can’t explain it, then it’s not understanding; it’s just aversion (though a degree of aversion to things that are contrary to the path is not necessarily bad).

### The axe-handle has finally worn out.

The axe-handle has finally worn out.

# WHAT?

This is an attempt to summarize my journey. Knowing fully well that my axe-handle is truly worn out - by HH standards.

The first radical change in my view and being was in Feb/Mar 2022. The change cemented over subsequent months. Since then and until Sep '24 I had suspected streamentry but did not try to confirm it. I did not see a point because I have lost value for labels and achievements in my personal life. In any case, I figured, I have to continue on the path with my efforts anyway. Only thing that has nagged me until June '24 has been about how much to prioritize formal meditation - and whether it was really important - because, after all, I am a house-holder with precious-little me-time. I have contemplated and tried to practice HH teachings ever since I first came across them in beginning 2022 - I had no doubt that it was an important thing to do. Meditation - I have been doing regularly since 2020 COVID lockdowns - assuming that it too was an important thing to do. I had not been able to attribute my shift in view to contemplation (HH) or meditation, or in whatever proportion.. I had not been able to clearly discern the factors leading to my fruition.

# WHY?

In general I do not believe that I can learn from others' stories - because karma manifestations are unique to every individual. Even when reading Dhamma material, I always skip biographical parts - even, Siddharta Gautam's. Nevertheless, a minor reason for this post is to maybe help develop conviction in those who seek inspiration from others' lives; even if only to validate that HH approach works.

I am not looking for validation; I have conviction now in my fruit. HH community has helped me since 2022 - starting with essays and audio-recordings from Ajahn Nyanamoli on his website, Bhante Anigha's comments and essays, Sister Medhini's essays, yt channel of HH and Samanadipa, and the fellow beings part of this r/HH. I look forward to contemplating any points that arise in this post - like for any r/HH posts.

My parents are in their 70s - and I have always prodded them to read about Dhamma, practice meditation. They have intellectual interest and have been trying to meditate. I had been wanting to send them for Vipassana. While I had myself suspected to have attained the first fruit, I have not been sure about what made it click for me - and what is the most efficient way to get my parents there. As of Sep'24 I am clear about the way that I must help them. Their time is limited - and that is the sort of urgency that led me to validate my own path up until now - and crystallize what really needs to be done. There is no time to waste in formal meditations; it is about right contemplation. I know that now.

I do not hope to teach anyone - except my parents and kids. I am lazy about remembering exact things/facts; I cannot quote suttas if you ask me "where did I read that". I rely on my understanding and intuition developed thru contemplation. Even on r/HillsideHermitage  I hesitate to post my response because I only have intuitive understanding - and defending my viewpoint is not my cup of tea. IRL I do not engage in deep Dharma discussions; I keep to my own; I have had faith in me and the teachings that I can do this on my own; that there is no other real option anyway! :)

I have held back from an urge to make this kind of a post in last many months - because I could not clarify my intention. "I am no teacher. "I am not going to be able to really help out someone. "Will it not be mere chest-thumping? "I still have doubts regarding my own practice." There are 2-3 draft-posts that I never posted - and then later realized that it was good I did not post because I was proven wrong since writing them. The only journal I have maintained for last 2 years is that of my spiritual thoughts, contemplation, experiences; going forward I see little need for that.

(What about this post? will it end up in that journal without getting posted? I think not)

While reading and following discussions on r/HillsideHermitage have been rewarding, I have not had any questions to make a post-of around my lived-experience; I have had reasonable good clarity since 2022. Of course there are hypotheticals to ponder over - but I don't engage in them. So I have had nothing to contribute, really, to r/HH - but gained a lot of insights here. My gratitude to the folks here.

# BACKGROUND:

I am a house-holder with one kid in college and another in middle-school. I was an atheist until 2017 when a once-in-lifetime incident forced me to existential questions (WHY ME?) - and eventually led me to Dhamma in 2018. Since the event I have had many spiritual (touching) encounters with people, animals that convinced me of our inter-connectedness. Early 2018 I had my first real intro to Buddhism in a Tibetan-Mahayana retreat. I took the first 4 precepts on that first retreat. Since then I have read commentaries, suttas, prioritized all my me-time for "practice" and retreats. My life became only more peaceful and at-ease with time. I have not had a teacher, except for the (group) retreats. I moved to Theravada readings because they were a smaller set of texts than Mahayana. Being an Indian atheist, I have always distrusted prayer, worship, rituals, guru-devotion etc. That helped me move faster, cut thru the fluff of Buddhism, on the path.

# TIMELINE:

Early Mar '22 I experienced complete dis-enchantment from all media. I simply stopped taking any pleasure in movies, TV-shows, music, etc. I was never into social-media anyway. End-Feb '22, during regular sitting meditations, I had gone from access-concentration to "J1" - once. I tried to regain the experience but failed; but I was not that crazy for it. I was practicing some moment-to-moment concentration too, around that time. All this, while listening and reading sutta-commentaries and contemplating.

April-July of '22 - I was fortunate to find solitude and I spent time contemplating and mediating. It was not planned, but it just happened; away from family and friends.

Soon, I lost fear of death, sickness, old-age; fear of seeing loved-ones getting hurt. I lost longing for company, friends, money, possessions, travel, adventure. I became dis-passionate but my life was more vibrant!

Oct '22 I fell ill with a combo of Dengue + Chikv infection - painful, nearly hospitalized; it took 4-6 months to get back on my feet, to go out for a walk in the park again; it took an year to recover my formal strength. But all through the illness and its after-effects, there was no mental suffering. The second-arrow had (has) completely vanished for me, along with FOMO and regrets.

The key thing I had understood in early Mar '22 was Karma and the 4NT (to some extent) - that that is the ultimate truth, and hence the only thing that matters in life. This led me to break-free from all conceptual attachments and cravings. Since then I have had no trouble keeping precept #7 perpetually. In later 2022, I also stopped keeping my journal that I had kept for 25 years - because it felt meaningless to record stuff about myself; past does not matter. The backups also do not matter anymore - emails, photos, videos, memories. In the here-and-now, none of that matters!

# PRECEPTS:

I have kept the 5 precepts for many years now through my adulthood. Last offenses:

P1 2014 or 2015 when I drowned a captured rat. I have slapped mosquitoes to death until 2021 or so.

P2 Nothing from any person that I can remember. From my corporate employer - a $100 item - in 2014

P3 Never

P4 Never, I think

P5 2014 - I was drunk on that last occasion and I vividly remember a very over-whelming sense of restraint for my words and actions while being drunk

P6 began as Intermittent Fasting (IF) in 2018 for health-reasons. Currently I generally eat only in a 4-5 hour window during the day. I do experience, and give-in to, food cravings - but I am aware of my actions. In social settings (though I avoid in general) I dont mind breaking fast. Also, I am not hung-up upon WHICH 4-5 hour-window in the day - we have a cook for the family and HER timings decide what hours I keep :)  not the noon-sun. I consume non-veg now and then; I am mindful of my consumption (and not just about food)

P7 kept it since 2022 as noted above. The interest in media disappeared once I had a clear understanding of what to prioritize in my life, what was really important. This had happened earlier too - once I understood that, physically, the time-travel cannot happen backwards in time, I lost interest in all the movies with time-travel tropes! (The only kind possible is the one shown in Intersteller - IMO)

I was floored watching Dune-1 in theaters - but when Dune-2 came out, I had no interest in it. The fantasies and folklores have lost meaning (and my interest) - what does it matter? I have understood what the most important thing is there to be understood; the only thing that matters. Even concepts - rebirth, bardo, realms - what do they matter - if they are not manifest in the here and now - why bother?

I do watch shows/movies with kids; my Dharma-teachings to my kids are all based on the shows and movies that they watch. There are characters and situations to exemplify and teach about wholesomeness vs un-wholesomeness. Music - sometimes listen to Kabir bhajans or Sufi music that now bear very clear meaning; they are a good reminder to practice, and also, WHY do we practice.

I am not the socializing-type; no need to dress-up.

P8 I have been a green-minimalist since 2014. I do not have much money for luxuries - just enough for kids' education. I am content with simple-living.

Solitude - I have very few friends IRL. I have almost always enjoyed solitude.

# CELIBACY & VIPASSANA:

I was last intimate in early 2019. But still, Celibacy has been the toughest battle. Its the fap - purely mental indulgence; not breaking #3. The longest I have kept celibacy is 3 months. That happened right after my first Goenka Vipassana retreat in Sep '23. I was thrilled upon realizing that the thoughts had "vanished" because of Vipassana; that I was no longer susceptible! The illusion was broken in 3 months - HH was right and I am still liable to be over-powered by craving - esp this particular type. I have tried to explain away the reasons - like "not enough of my past karma has been washed away" and that "more scanning" will help :)

BTW, I had no trouble reaching full-body dissolution in my 1st Goenka retreat. Now I know its only because I have kept sila for a long time. I did not give much importance to experiences that arose - knowing well that I cannot get it on-demand. The lack of control over manifesting - is strongly tied to my understanding of Karma ca. 2022.

I went to my second Goenka retreat in March '24 - hungering for solitude. It brought immense peace, like last time. Good vibrations too :)  But on the final night, after I had been relieved from the precepts - the fap happened. That put me in deeper self-doubt. If I were a stream-enterer (or nearly there), how come I dont have "good self-control", why do I "get angry" at times? Why can I not "keep mindfulness of body/breath 24x7"?

# JHANA:

June '24 I had some me-time and I started listening to Rob Burbea's Jhana instructions. I had achieved Kundalini-awakening in May '23 with those instructions. This time around, it was quite easy for me to get to J1 - or what I have discerned to be the 1st Jhana - I do not really care if it is "defined as" or "really is" J1 or not. I was/am able to get that feeling almost any time in any posture - let go of stress, mental-activity, and I breathe - and the spark is there. This is different from manifesting a pleasant state, its more like relaxing and letting-go; letting-go, not reaching-for.

As of late June my '24 sitting-meditation, vipassana etc. stopped altogether - because of no solitude in early-hours. I was curious of the "withdrawl symptoms". Keeping awareness of the 5 aggregates and contemplation have continued without break all the time - as I dont need me-time/solitude for that.

Finally I got curious again of my spiritual-state, started digging into Samandipa and HH videos and looking up the definition and progress thru the fetters. It made sense and this is the post about it.

# CURRENT STATUS:

I am ok. Nothing special to do except take on the challenges of a householder, one day at a time until the kids mature into adulthood. And then I will seek a formal teacher, solitude, jhanas, etc.

Regardless, I just keep awareness of my 5 aggregates, sometimes contemplate; chop-wood-carry-water.

edit: formatting

edit: celibacy - last date early 2019

edit: current status: I am not looking to progress to/in jhanas or in vipassana. I dont have the time in my family life - as of now. It has been very hard to make 10 days of time for retreats in a nuclear-family with kids. The retreats have always been helpful to me - but they are not "it" - thats the realization I have tried to capture in my OP.

    Since you mentioned you are open to contemplating replies to your post:

    > While I had myself suspected to have attained the first fruit, I have not been sure about what made it click for me 

    That's would simply not be possible if it actually were the fruit of stream entry. "Shifts of view" and "transformational insights" are just that, not stream entry, and the contemporary idea of "fruition" that's implied in the post is a misinterpretation of how the word *phala* is used in the Suttas. 

    People think that a "fruition experience" is what makes one a sotāpanna, which naturally leads to this "I know it, but I can't explain it" idea.

    This flies in the face of the whole reasoning behind the simile of the axe handle: you can't not know what caused the axe handle to wear away if you actually wore it away, because it would've been you yourself, with your own hands, grabbing it and swinging it millions of times. In that timespan, there would be dozens of "shifts" and "insights" even more profound than what you describe, and none of them are *sotāpatti* yet.

    >But all through the illness and its after-effects, there was no mental suffering. The second-arrow had (has) completely vanished for me

    That doesn't mean the second arrow has vanished. That's a common point of confusion. It simply means that, probably due to the mental fortitude and stability created by your virtue and restraint, and maybe some degree of innate toughness, *there was no arrow to begin with*. Freedom from the second arrow is way more profound than that: it's not being touched by *arisen* mental suffering, regardless of how intense it is.

    > use the information they learn from the HH channel to reinforce their existing misconceptions.

    Indeed. When there's a will, there's a way to see past even the most cautious caveating and moving of goalposts, and to underestimate just how much further ahead of where you are the instruction is telling you to go. The depth of even "revolutionary" ideas like "Uprooting VS Management" can easily be underestimated, and thus, assumed as already understood.

    >I cannot put my finger on "the event" that was the turning point.

    The point is that there isn’t such a thing, and expecting to find it implies not just a theoretical misunderstanding, but an actively held *view.* There isn’t one single swing of the axe, no matter how forceful, that can wear away the handle all by itself.

    Since you seem to be relatively restrained in your behavior, it wouldn’t be productive to look at the issue in terms of the overall "intensity" of suffering. Virtue and restraint puts a permanent and tangible cap on one’s suffering for as long as that restraint is there, which, paired with some making sense of the teachings, can easily be mistaken for *sotāpatti* if there is a lack of self-honesty and patience.

    Only with such self-honesty would you be able to realize that things that you most likely regard as acceptable actually partake in the first three fetters and the second arrow still.

    There is a loud crack that occurs just before a tree that’s being cut falls to the ground. But that sound is not what felled the tree; it was the dozens of strikes with the axe that gradually brought it down. So no matter how successfully you reproduce that noise through other means, if you haven’t been hacking away at the tree, it won’t fall, and all you will have is the noise and no wood. On the other hand, if you focus on striking the tree with the axe, the tree will eventually fall, even if for some reason it does so in perfect silence.

    Similarly, inasmuch as one can talk about a distinct "event" of stream-entry, it is due to the person’s prior work, over a prolonged period of time, of clearing away the things in their own conduct that obstruct understanding, and weakening the fetters. It’s a *result* of the practice done before, and it would never come suddenly or unexpectedly, nor would it magically cut through fetters that were firm and strong moments before.

    The idea of a "turning point" used in the OP is of an event whose mere occurence—even if you don't know how or why it came about—turns you into a sotāpanna regardless of the work you did (or not) before.

    From that premise, you get many of the wrong views prevalent today about what enlightenment is (e.g., that it's a sudden and momentary "glimpse of Nibbāna", and that there are ways to "accelerate" the occurence of that fateful event ), whereas the Buddha said that penetration to knowledge is never abrupt and comes about only through gradual training.

    >But is it not *because* of the appearance of the sun that the darkness is dispelled?

    Yes, but the "sun", the Dhamma-eye, is the understanding of the Four Noble Truths, which means you would be 100% sure about what it is that you understood, how you understood it, and you'd also be able to explain it to others with full confidence and clarity. It wouldn't be a mystical "experience" that you need to read into and interpret after the fact (which shows that in reality the "darkness", i.e., doubt and lack of clarity, is still there).

    And like anything else in life, you would've understood those truths because you've been actively trying to do so for a period of time (most likely years), and not all of a sudden on account of some totally unrelated effort, such as a meditation technique.

### I Still Don't Understand about Sotapanna

Hi brothers and sisters in dhamma. Sometime ago another member of this subreddit made a post about the suffering of Sotapnna, I read the thread and I saw how Bhikku Anigha gave very interesting answer and it leads to me having more question.

>

So, **in comparison** to one's *puthujjana* state (since you can only ever speak in relative terms; there is no unit of measurement for feelings), a *sotāpanna* feels effectively nothing, because that ever-present second arrow that was always 99% of all the suffering the *puthujjana* experienced is completely gone. The first arrow is nothing compared to that. And, as some Suttas say, Nibbāna is where nothing is felt, and *that* is pleasant.

>...............................  
And yes, adding just "seven grains" to the experience of an Arahant is enough to be able to cry like Ānanda, and to be overwhelmed with sexual desire like Vaṅgīsa. Still, experientially speaking, although it might look the same externally, that *is* effectively nothing compared to the suffering of a puthujjana. Even in those absolute rock-bottom moments, it's all just the first arrow.

Bhikku Anigha said this, but also, in different answer he said this.

> That's why many *sotāpannas* in the Suttas could become quite heedless, to the point that, on top of not ordaining, they would continue to lead a normal householder's life and not be celibate.

I am wondering, if Sotpanna's 2nd arrow is 99 percent gone, how can they not be automatically celibate?? Doesn't the absence of second arrow means they wouldnt have the craving to "scratch the itch" in lots of types of pleasure, and also mean they should be automatically celibate??

I hope Bhikku Anigha can give answers, and you guys who are more experienced can also give me your opinion.

    >Doesn't the absence of second arrow means they wouldnt have the craving to "scratch the itch" in lots of types of pleasure, and also mean they should be automatically celibate??

    It means that they're incapable of experiencing the "itch" in the way a puthujjana does, but it doesn't mean that they will never scratch it.

    As the Arrow Sutta says, the puthujjana knows no other escape from pain than sensual pleasure—any pleasure that is bound with attachment and depends on circumstances, and that includes things like career, friends, hobbies, and also meditation for most people—which means that for him, scratching an arisen sensual itch is a matter of existential importance. Not doing so automatically means being crushed by his own mind. He might become skilled at *preventing the itch from arising* (which is what is commonly regarded as "meditation"), but if and when it arises, he's completely cornered.

    A noble disciple, since he does understand the true escape from all suffering, would engage in sensuality simply out of habit and laziness. He would not be troubled if he had no access to sensual pleasure when the itch arises.

    Because of that, that itch can never have the threatening, commanding quality that it has for the puthujjana, even if it gets quite intense at times and he gives in to it.

    Also, owing to his understanding of all craving as suffering, a sotāpanna can't possibly hold the view that sensuality is somehow beneficial, acceptable, justified, or excusable, regardless of the circumstances. When he does give in to it, it's out of pure weakness. 

    But a puthujjana is able to—and most often will—hold the view that engaging in sensuality *can* be beneficial because he doesn't see the danger in it, let alone in *upādāna* generally.

    >But isn't preventing the itch a good thing to do until you can finally be able to not be affected by the itch?

    You should certainly try to tailor your environment so you're not constantly exposed to things that provoke the "itch." But even when you do that, it will inevitably arise on the level of your thoughts, and that's where the training happens (enduring it and developing the right context in face of it). That's when you'll really start to feel it, in fact.

    You will not wake up one day and somehow no longer be affected by it if your practice so far has revolved around preventing the itch.

    >Is it because they don't see sensuality as a pit of burning embers yet?

    They do. The Buddha talked about this explicitly:

    >Sensuality gives little gratification and much suffering and distress, and the woe in it is what's greater. Mahānāma, even though a noble disciple has seen this as it is with right understanding, as long as they do not achieve the joy and comfort that are apart from sensuality and detrimental phenomena, or something even more peaceful than that, they still might return to sensuality. [\[3\]](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn14#comment3) But when they do achieve that joy and comfort, or something more peaceful than that, then they do not return to sensuality. [\[4\]](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn14#comment4)

    >Before my awakening—when I was still unawakened but intent on awakening—I too clearly saw with right understanding that: ‘Sensuality gives little gratification and much suffering and distress, and the woe in them is what's greater.’ But so long as I didn’t achieve the joy and comfort that are apart from sensuality and detrimental phenomena, or something even more peaceful than that, I didn’t claim that I would not return to sensuality. But when I did achieve that joy and comfort, or something more peaceful than that, then I claimed that I would not return to sensuality.

    So, even though they do know the escape, they may not have reached the point where it’s pleasant to stick to it. Hence the whole distinction of [pleasant vs unpleasant practice](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an4.162), which strictly speaking applies only to noble disciples given that the five faculties are mentioned.

### To what extent should "I" assume responsibility for phenomena arising in my experience?

When I can sense my mind in an unwholesome state (e.g., lust, anger, laziness, and so on), to what extent should I assume responsibility for causing to arise vs perceiving it as "un-ownable"?  Or perhaps is responsibility for vs un-ownable different things, or is this altogether a wrong line of questioning?

For example, suppose lust arises in the mind.  Even though I have been practicing/guarding my sense doors, its having arisen could be due to

1. just the natural remnants of an untrained mind becoming more tame,
2. I haven't been guarding my senses careful enough,
3. I still see value in sensuality, or
4. some other causal factor I haven't figured out yet.

It seems to me that option #1 should assumed only if all of the other options have not be thoroughly investigated and confirmed to not be the cause.

On a meta level, I'm also trying to reconcile "I am the owner of my actions" (kammassakomhi) with avoiding the wrong view of ownership over one's senses (more specifically, the contents of one's sensory experience).  Apologies in advance if I have butchered the paraphrasing.

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1f89y5q/to_what_extent_should_i_assume_responsibility_for/llgm0qi/)** _2024-09-04 13:07:55:

    Whenever you intentionally break a precept or fail to exercise restraint, that in itself should be regarded as an act of taking ownership of your experience. The emphasis should be on preventing the transgression from recurring, not in trying to wriggle out of the remorse by re-framing it in light of the "Dhamma" of not-self, etc. [The sense of shame and fear of wrongdoing is the precursor to wholesome states](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an10.105).

    Although virtue alone is not the Dhamma, there cannot be Dhamma (non-ownership) apart from virtue.

    But if you know that you have been restrained and keeping your precepts, you are alone in seclusion, and aren’t doing anything unwholesome at the time, *then* you are in a position to try to understand what is left over as not yours.

### Do we have control over "wanting of the wanting"?

https://youtu.be/_ttVxzlzlj0?si=IoAf5KlD_GzN8V0N

In this video, Ajahn discusses the wanting of wanting of sensual objects. 

If the wanting is there on it's own, out of my control, phenomena enduring there by itself, what is it that makes "wanting of the wanting" something different from that? Isn't that also a phenomena that I'm subject to/secondary to and is out of my control? 

I have a similar question about upadana. Is upadana a phenomena (Dhamma)? What did the Buddha mean when he said "upadana is not in the five aggregates, nor is it apart from them." As I currently understand, the five aggregates is the totality of my experience. If that's the case, how can upadana be apart from the aggregates/how can it not be a phenomena?



- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1f2jyr4/do_we_have_control_over_wanting_of_the_wanting/lkai18e/)** _2024-08-28 04:16:56:

    >what is it that makes "wanting of the wanting" something different from that?

    One of them is a mental state, the other is your volition in regard to that mental state. You can say that your volition is also a phenomenon, but if you say that it's not in your control, you fall into denial of *kamma*, which is a textbook wrong view.

    >As I currently understand, the five aggregates is the totality of my experience. If that's the case, how can upadana be apart from the aggregates/how can it not be a phenomena?

    You can't look at it from a purely theoretical point of view, as if you could describe your experience objectively. The ordinary person cannot see the totality of their experience even when they try to think about it, and thus, *upādāna,* even though technically it's also a phenomenon within that experience, is not so ***for them***. For them, since *upādāna* is not seen, it *is* "outside,"  even though that's technically impossible. [That's why it's said that the defilements are gratuitous, and the mind itself is radiant](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an1.51-60#an1.51:1.1-an1.51:1.4), which doesn't mean we're "already enlightened" or similar; without a great deal of effort, defilements will remain indefinitely. The intrinsic "radiance" simply means that enlightenment is always *possible* to develop.

    Once you do get to see the totality of your experience (which is what an unwavering commitment to virtue and sense restraint gradually achieves), and *upādāna* can be recognized as a phenomenon, it automatically ceases to be there. It's something that can only operate in the dark, unseen.

    >Take an unlearned ordinary person who has not seen the noble ones, and is neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve not seen true persons, and are neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the true persons.

    >They regard form \[feeling, etc.\] as self. But that regarding is an activity. [\[1\]](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=sn22.81#comment1) And what’s the foundation, origin, birthplace, and source of that activity? For an unlearned ordinary person, struck by feelings born of ignorance-contact, craving has arisen. That activity is born from that. So that activity is impermanent, determined, and dependently originated. [\[2\]](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=sn22.81#comment2) And that craving, that feeling, that contact, and that ignorance are also impermanent, determined, and dependently originated. For one who knows and sees in this way, bhikkhus, there is **immediate destruction of the influxes.**

    That's how they’re generally understood, but that notion can be inaccurate depending on what the person understands by it.

    Often times, the tacit assumption is that one has access to a standpoint that’s somehow not within the five aggregates from which one can neatly chop the experience into pieces and investigate its nature, which means that the person ends up seeing as part of the aggregates and as not-self everything but what matters most: their own present intention and point of view, which is the part where the sense of self, greed, aversion, delusion, and everything unwholesome finds footing. MN 2 refers to this as "seeing not-self with self".

    It’s a form of *ayoniso manasikāra.*

    >But I fail to grasp how attention itself can be composed of these aggregates, because it seems like a new fundamental building block itself.

    Yes, that’s the difficulty. The "attention itself", due to being less clearly defined than the things you attend to, will appear to be somehow separate from everything else. And the task is not to look closer at the attention itself, at which point it will cease to be attention, but to know its nature simultaneously but indirectly (which is what is meant with "peripheral awareness").

    Attention to a sight is in itself just an intention that you would not be intending if you didn’t have eyes, for example. Form and all the other aggregates are found at that background level too, not just at the foreground of the external sight (otherwise we would all respond exactly the same way to the same sense object).

### Magga & Phala, Right View, Stream Entry and faith/dhamma followers - regarding recent events

What if we take the interpretation that Right View is something different from Stream Entry?
Hear my out here.

Often times in the suttas getting right view and stream entry seems to go hand in hand, mainly after certain individuals with the necessary preconditions heard a discourse from the Buddha.

Yet there is also this certain very elusive category of faith & dhamma followers, those on the path (magga) and striving for stream entry, but having not yet achieved the fruit (phala)(stream entry).

They seem to inhabit certain ariyan qualities which make them destined to achieve stream entry at their death, when they can no longer postone the pratice.

What if we say that this category has "Right View" but they haven't reached stream entry yet. This would enable them to for example teach others, even reduce their suffering somewhat, without having "seen" the path for themselves.

An example of such an individual in the suttas might have been the heavy drinker Sarakāni, who due to his negligence in sense restraint could not attain stream entry but possed enough confidence and wisdom to possess Right View. I have attached the sutta SN 55.24 at the bottom of this post.
My theory is that most of *serious* practitioners are like Sarakāni, due to having been born in the current age of sense indulgence.

I am quite curious about what Bhikku Anigha and Keller Dellinger might think of this interpretation. Essentially this would mean that a number of us may be considered noble in the broadest sense of having the right view, but not in the strictest sense of having completed the path to stream entry trough perfected virtue. 

(One may not know themselves to be a faith/dhamma followerer, hence why people came up to the buddha and asked about it.
Stream Entry in contrast is definitely noticeable, since your entire perspective gets turned upside down.)

I basically propose that the faith/dhamma followers have Right View but not the fruit of Stream entry, and that these terms are often used synonymously because they can happen in quick succession/simultaneously.  Hence the confusion about such an elusive term.




The sutta reference:
SN 55.24 Paṭhamasaraṇānisakkasutta: About Sarakāni (1st) (Translation by Bhikku Sujato)

At Kapilavatthu.

Now at that time Sarakāni the Sakyan had passed away. The Buddha declared that he was a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening.

At that, several Sakyans came together complaining, grumbling, and objecting, “Oh, how incredible, how amazing! Who can’t become a stream-enterer these days? For the Buddha even declared Sarakāni to be a stream-enterer after he passed away. Sarakāni was too weak for the training; he used to drink alcohol.”

Then Mahānāma the Sakyan went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. The Buddha said:

“Mahānāma, when a lay follower has for a long time gone for refuge to the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha, how could they go to the underworld? And if anyone should rightly be said to have for a long time gone for refuge to the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha, it’s Sarakāni the Sakyan. Sarakāni the Sakyan has for a long time gone for refuge to the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha. How could he go to the underworld?

Take a certain person who has experiential confidence in the Buddha … the teaching … the Saṅgha … They have laughing wisdom and swift wisdom, and are endowed with freedom. They’ve realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements. This person is exempt from hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm. They’re exempt from places of loss, bad places, the underworld.

Take another person who has experiential confidence in the Buddha … the teaching … the Saṅgha … They have laughing wisdom and swift wisdom, but are not endowed with freedom. With the ending of the five lower fetters they’re reborn spontaneously. They are extinguished there, and are not liable to return from that world. This person, too, is exempt from hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm. They’re exempt from places of loss, bad places, the underworld.

Take another person who has experiential confidence in the Buddha … the teaching … the Saṅgha … But they don’t have laughing wisdom or swift wisdom, nor are they endowed with freedom. With the ending of three fetters, and the weakening of greed, hate, and delusion, they’re a once-returner. They come back to this world once only, then make an end of suffering. This person, too, is exempt from hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm. They’re exempt from places of loss, bad places, the underworld.

Take another person who has experiential confidence in the Buddha … the teaching … the Saṅgha … But they don’t have laughing wisdom or swift wisdom, nor are they endowed with freedom. With the ending of three fetters they’re a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening. This person, too, is exempt from hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm. They’re exempt from places of loss, bad places, the underworld.

Take another person who doesn’t have experiential confidence in the Buddha … the teaching … the Saṅgha … They don’t have laughing wisdom or swift wisdom, nor are they endowed with freedom. Still, they have these qualities: the faculties of faith, energy, mindfulness, immersion, and wisdom. And they accept the teachings proclaimed by the Realized One after deliberating them with a degree of wisdom. This person, too, doesn’t go to hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm. They don’t go to places of loss, bad places, the underworld.

Take another person who doesn’t have experiential confidence in the Buddha … the teaching … the Saṅgha … They don’t have laughing wisdom or swift wisdom, nor are they endowed with freedom. Still, they have these qualities: the faculties of faith, energy, mindfulness, immersion, and wisdom. And they have a degree of faith and love for the Buddha. This person, too, doesn’t go to hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm. They don’t go to places of loss, bad places, the underworld.

If these great sal trees could understand what was well said and poorly said, I’d declare them to be stream-enterers. Why can’t this apply to Sarakāni? Mahānāma, Sarakāni the Sakyan undertook the training at the time of his death.”

    >I merely wanted to broaden the scope a little and allow people to teach others (when their approach seems to match the suttas) even before eliminating the second arrow themselves

    And how would they know that the second arrow isn't yet eliminated because they're on the path but haven't reached the fruit, and not because they aren't on the path to begin with, and still have wrong view?

    In fact, faith followers and dhamma followers are also noble disciples, so what's said in the Arrow Sutta applies to them too. [They have transcended the plane of puthujjanas (for some reason translated as "untrue person" here), and are guaranteed to realize stream entry in this life](https://suttacentral.net/sn25.1/en/sujato).

    >Just like the baby calf who had just been born, but, urged on by its mother’s lowing, still managed to cross the Ganges to safety are the bhikkhus who are Dhamma-followers and faith-followers. They too, having breasted Māra’s stream, will safely cross over to the far shore. 

    —MN 34

    They haven't simply "made sense" of the Dhamma.

    Besides, no matter what their individual views are, every Buddhist will have come across other Buddhists who, from that person's point of view, hold egregious views about the Dhamma and yet are convinced that it's all straight from the Suttas and that they're at least on the path to stream entry. From that alone, you can see that it's an awful criterion.

    And the moment someone becomes a teacher, they've turned their backs on the possibility that their views may be wrong.

    So this approach would be for the great harm of both the teacher and the students.

### Another yoniso manisikara question...

So it was thinking. What is the existential manifestation of yoniso manisikara? So I thought let's say I have the hinderance of remorse arise I have two smoke a cigarette or don't smoke and just endure it the way it's supposed to be endured (from the not personal point of view which can be bodily activity)... so sister medhini said in a video before that a non sensual thought is the thought of the danger of sensuality. As in the good thought is manifested negatively not as an object you can attend to.

So I was thinking yoniso may not be so different. 

Back to the example. A hinderance has arisen, I know if I cover it up il I won't address the issue I would just be putting my attention somewhere else( attending things unfit for attention) so instead I know the arisen hinderance and pressure to get rid of it I don't give in because I know this is not the escape. Then since trying to cover it up is not escape would restraint be the stepping outside while inside.

    Yes, that's right. It usually helps to make some effort to remind yourself about the danger in taking the bait, but at the end of the day, the "meat" of *yoniso manasikāra* is in the simple resolve not to perform the unwholesome action, while also not trying to remove the pressure if it has arisen. Hence, you're already practicing a degree of *yoniso manasikāra* if you really make sure to keep the precepts unbroken (without resorting to a calming technique), whereas figuring out all the details of how to practice it but not actually keeping the precepts would hardly bring you any closer.

### A Sotāpanna's Suffering

Hello everyone!

There was a certain passage in Keller's [recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1eylaun/i_am_a_puthujjana/) that got me interested in writing this post. It is this one:

>Bhante continued on to explain that this lack of suffering experienced by a sotāpanna is the exact same as that lack of suffering experienced by an arahant: that they **feel nothing**. Or, at least, that they feel nothing regarding any pressure coming from the first three fetters which, if we take the himalaya mountain/seven grains of sand analogy seriously, means they do truly feel effectively nothing. 

I am wondering how the statement that a *sekha* feels nothing can be squared with the description of Ānanda's grieving on account of the Buddha's imminent passing in the Mahāparinibbāna-sutta, DN 16:

>Then the Venerable Ānanda, entering the dwelling, leaned on the lintel and stood crying: 'And I am only a trainee, who still has his task (ahead), and there will be the final extinguishment of my teacher, who is one compassionate towards me.'

>*atha kho āyasmā ānando vihāraṃ pavisitvā kapisīsaṃ ālambitvā rodamāno aṭṭhāsi — “ahañca vatamhi sekho sakaraṇīyo, satthu ca me parinibbānaṃ bhavissati, yo mama anukampako”ti.*

Could someone who feels nothing become so visibly overcome with grief? Or should we interpret this as feeling nothing "regarding any pressure coming from the first three fetters"?

The analogy of "the seven stone fragments the size of mustard seeds" (*satta sāsapamattiyo pāsāṇasakkharā,* SN 56.59/60) compared to the Himālaya is actually about the *dukkha* of the seven more existences that remain for a *sotāpanna,* which the [sutta](https://suttacentral.net/sn56.60/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=sidebyside&reference=main&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin) explicitly states. That the term *sattakkattuparamatā* 'the fact of seven times at most' refers indeed to what is commonly called "rebirth" can perhaps best be seen from [AN 3.88](https://suttacentral.net/an3.88/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=sidebyside&reference=main&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin) and [AN 9.12](https://suttacentral.net/an9.12/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=sidebyside&reference=main&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin), referring to the (first type of) *sotāpanna*:

>Through the wearing away of three fetters, he is one of seven times at most. Having run on, having wandered on seven times at most towards gods and humans he makes an end to suffering.

>*so tiṇṇaṃ saṃyojanānaṃ parikkhayā sattakkhattuparamo hoti. sattakkhattuparamaṃ deve ca manusse ca sandhāvitvā saṃsaritvā dukkhassantaṃ karoti.*

Based on that, the simile is actually inadequate to be used for the suffering that still remains for a *sotāpanna* in their present existence.

Again, it is not my intention to be dismissive of anyone, or wanting to criticize for its own sake. Only I feel that these two points do not fully hold against the suttas.

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1ezf1p7/a_sotāpannas_suffering/ljntada/)** _2024-08-24 04:50:22:

    Based on that simile alone, yes, it might seem like a *sotāpanna* experiences largely the same suffering as a puthujjana, just that the amount of it is limited to the remainder of seven lives.

    But see the [Arrow Sutta](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=sn36.6), particularly the following lines:

    >In the same way, a learned noble disciple, when struck by unpleasant feeling, doesn’t sorrow, wail, lament, beat their breast or become muddled. They feel one feeling: one bodily, and none pertaining to the *citta*.  
    ...  
    If they feel a pleasant feeling, they feel it unyoked. If they feel an unpleasant feeling, they feel it unyoked. If they feel a neither-pleasant-nor-unpleasant feeling, they feel it unyoked.

    >This is called a learned noble disciple who is **unyoked from birth, old age, and death, from sorrows, lamentations, pains, dissatisfactions, and tribulations; who is unyoked from suffering, I say.**

    >...  
    One who understands and is learned **does not feel a feeling**  
    **of pleasure or unpleasure.**  
    This is the great distinction  
    between the wise and skilled, and the ordinary person.

    It's a grave but common mistake to think that a *puthujjana* can at times not experience the second arrow. The reality is that, as the Sutta says, whenever they experience displeasure, the second arrow is inevitably there.

    So, **in comparison** to one's *puthujjana* state (since you can only ever speak in relative terms; there is no unit of measurement for feelings), a *sotāpanna* feels effectively nothing, because that ever-present second arrow that was always 99% of all the suffering the *puthujjana* experienced is completely gone. The first arrow is nothing compared to that. And, as some Suttas say, Nibbāna is where nothing is felt, and *that* is pleasant. A *sotāpanna* abides in Nibbāna to the degree that they have realized the third noble truth.

    Of course, once you actually become a *sotāpanna,* the suffering that's left does feel excessive because now that's all you have, and that remainder would motivate you to strive further. But if you don't draw that clear distinction between the feelings of *puthujjana* and *sotāpanna*, you end up with the common case of a *puthujjana* who gained some special ["insight"](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn29#mn29:5.1-mn29:5.24) and now assumes himself to have the Right View, while in the end still being liable to the second arrow (though they may not notice it due to lack of self-transparency, and increased virtue, sense restraint, and commitment to Dhamma in general).

    It can be compared to someone who still experiences minor lingering symptoms from a deadly illness that they were already cured of. The fact of the matter is, even if at times the symptoms they experience are *more* intense and physically painful than those of a person who's still ill and may die at any moment from the disease, they will never be the felt the same way. The ill person's palpable symptoms may be less or even none, in fact, but the real pain they are perpetually subject to stems from the fact that they're trapped by and cannot escape that illness that will kill them sooner or later. The particular symptoms are just the cherry on the cake when they show up.

    It's also important to clarify that "not feeling anything" doesn't mean what people usually understand by that. There's lots of puthujjanas who "don't not feel anything", but out of sheer indolence, dullness, and apathy, which is emphatically not what Nibbāna is. "Not feeling anything" in this right sense is a result of the absence of ignorance, and not of becoming a lifeless rock. On many occasions, the Buddha himself alluded to how he experienced not just physical pleasure and pain, but also mental happiness and mental discomfort.

    And yes, adding just "seven grains" to the experience of an Arahant is enough to be able to cry like Ānanda, and to be overwhelmed with sexual desire like Vaṅgīsa. Still, experientially speaking, although it might look the same externally, that *is* effectively nothing compared to the suffering of a puthujjana. Even in those absolute rock-bottom moments, it's all just the first arrow.

    That sounds confusing and somewhat paradoxical, but it's not supposed to make sense from a *puthujjana's* perspective. If it does, and you're still a *puthujjana*, you should be concerned. The Dhamma is "beyond reasoning" (*atakkāvacara),* and can only be experienced by the wise for themselves.

    So, whichever way we wish to interpret the simile of the seven grains of sand, it's not seven more existences of more or less the same feelings that you know now as a *puthujjana. Sotāpannas* have only seven existences left not because of a cosmic decree, but because *internally*, that's how little potential for being is left in them (and it may be even less, since it's not that every sotāpanna has to have 7 more existences). So *both* the limited amount of reappearances in the future and the limited amount of suffering in the present are byproducts of the same internal development that makes them, from a *puthujjana*'s point of view, be free from suffering.

    >or it is an over interpretation to consider that the whole sutta applies to a stream enterer.

    You can take it that way, and risk the possibility that you will end up taking yourself as a stream-enterer when you actually aren't,[ thus automatically losing the chance to ever become one](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an5.152#an5.152:1.3-an5.152:1.4) unless you change your mind. Or, you can assume that the Buddha actually meant what he said, and realize that your current understanding underestimates the depth of what a *sotāpanna* is. You have nothing to lose from the latter option.

    The Buddha could've also been addressing this Sutta mainly at *puthujjanas,* in which case it is accurate to say that a *sotāpanna* has "gone beyond being". From the *puthujjana's* point of view, he has. Nobody has a detached, third-person point of view from which they can neatly lay out and investigate the characteristics of each noble attainment, because whatever you think about and imagine is always conceived within the confines of your present state.

    In order to become a *sotāpanna,* a *puthujjana* must be aiming at the complete cessation of being, and not at the amount of being that he imagines a *sotāpanna* still possesses. The latter is the surefire way to overestimation, while the former is what a heedful person who recognizes[ all being as perilous ](https://suttacentral.net/an1.316-332/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=main&notes=none&highlight=false&script=latin#an1.328_1.1)and all craving as suffering would be doing.

    Having set their sights on that *complete* cessation of being, they would along the way pass through the milestone of stream-entry. If they don't aim at that, they're not on the right path to begin with.

    >Could we say it refers to having become able to endure the pressure of *any* type of presently persisting feeling indefinitely, neither giving in, nor denying it?

    [Technically yes,](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.228/en/bodhi?lang=en) but it's easy for a well-instructed *puthujjana* to be convinced that he's already doing that, and thus it would not be the best description.

    Another way of explaining it conceptually is that it's because a noble disciple [is incapable of taking any *saṅkhāra* at all as permanent or pleasant, and any *dhamma* at all as self.](https://suttacentral.net/mn115/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=main&notes=none&highlight=false&script=latin#12.2) To that extent they're no longer liable to ignorance, and where there isn't ignorance, there is no contact/pressure, and thus no possibility for feeling (referring here to the *paṭiccasamuppāda* cessation formula). Put another way, none of the feelings that arise *can* be "his" even if he wants them to (including the intense feelings that accompany sorrow and crying), and to that extent, they don't pressure *him*.

    Despite their occasionally substantial "weight" and forcefulness, there is no sense of being confined or oppressed by those feelings, just as someone who finds himself in the worst of maximum security prisons, full of rapists and serial killers, while at the same time having the option to get out the second he wishes to. But he might've made good friends with *some* of the rapists and serial killers and be doing quite well overall, and so he may postpone his departure for quite a bit until something prompts him to finally leave. This is what the Arrow Sutta refers to with being "unyoked" or "unfettered" from feelings.

    The Arahant, however, has completely left the prison, and cut all ties with anything and anyone within it, and is thus incapable of ever re-entering it. It could be said that for him, there is not even the first arrow.

    Now, an important note to make is that a *puthujjana*, if he has a steady practice of virtue and sense restraint (based on a degree of *yoniso manasikāra* and not absorption/concentration), can also cease to be noticeably liable to the second arrow. But that's because those practices they have (rightly) become skilled in are able to keep the first arrow in check, in a semi-permanent manner (i.e., for as long as they don't become unvirtuous and unrestrained). In other words, they find themselves in a relatively agreeable prison, but at the end of the day, if they ever wanted to leave altogether, they can't.

    A *sotāpanna* cannot ever be touched by feelings in the same way again even if he were to totally give up the practice, make no effort to remember any of what he's understood, and fill his mind with nothing but mundane preoccupations for the remaining decades of his life (or eons in heavenly realms). He would naturally incline to keep the five precepts without even thinking about it, but everything else he can just throw out the window. That's why many *sotāpannas* in the Suttas could become quite heedless, to the point that, on top of not ordaining, they would continue to lead a normal householder's life and not be celibate.

    You're only truly free from the fetter of *sīlabbataparāmāsa* when you don't get affected by suffering any more even if you don't do any practice at all\*,\* not even restraining your senses, "enduring pressure on the right level", and not forgetting the context. Those are the right "*sīlabbata"*, but their only purpose is to create the basis for right understanding and thereby liberation to take root. They are not liberation themselves.

    That's also how only a *sotāpanna* can have an accurate sense of what an Arahant is: he has a perfectly concrete, internal reference point for a liberation that is perfectly *unconditioned*, whereas any liberation that a *puthujjana* may know is conditioned by him having to ***do*** something, even if it's the right things. Seeing that for himself, he would know exactly in what direction to go.

    A *sotāpanna* would continue to engage in the right practices only if he has interest in progressing further at the time, and if he doesn't do them, what he has developed cannot be undone. A (honest) *puthujjana* knows deep down that if he gives those (right) practices up for too long, he will eventually lose the temporary degree of peace that he gained.

    To come back to the analogy, the prisoner who knows he's able to escape no matter what doesn't need to perform any sort of mental exercise or remind himself about some aspect of the internal situation of the prison in order to not feel confined. That sense of confinement simply cannot arise.

    >It's hard to know for sure as there is room for controversy on the topic. 

    There really isn't. On the whole, the Suttas present a clear standard to judge what stream-entry is, but only if one realizes that it's not about fulfilling *one* of the criteria. Instead, the actual stream-enterer is the one who checks *all* the boxes the Suttas provide\*:\* complete faith in the Triple Gem, the four noble truths, the five faculties, the 7 grains of sand left, the freedom from the lower realms, the freedom from the second arrow, knowledge of *yoniso manasikāra* and the sign of the mind, the inability to take anything as permanent, suffering, or self, the destruction of the first three fetters, seeing for himself all the things mentioned in MN 9, etc. There's basically no room for ambiguity or controversy when you look at it that way, since whoever isn't really a *sotāpanna* will have to fail in at least *one* of the criteria (if they're self-honest).

    >So there is a lot of work left and that is all I need to know.  

    The topic is still important because if someone has any semblance of an idea that they already have Right View when they don't, they will not be questioning their understanding of practices like abandoning the hindrances deeply enough. They will simply continue to develop in line with their present insufficient understanding, and there is nothing that can rectify that except acknowledging that the understanding was inaccurate and backtracking all the way back to the beginning. And one of the things that could prompt them to do so would be realizing that they're still ultimately as liable to suffering as they were before, no matter what profound insights or transformative "experiences" they've had.

    >How is this not a blatant contradiction?

    There are many such "contradictions" in the Suttas, and what the presence of a contradiction indicates is that one's understanding should be revised. You're presented with several fingers, all of which are supposed to be pointing at the moon, even though they're pointing in wildly different directions. Once you arrive at the moon, you realize that all the fingers *were* actually pointing to it, and if you had decided to trust only one and not the others, you would've ended up going in a wrong direction and never arrived at the goal.

    In line with the Arrow Sutta, the noble disciple's body weeps, not his mind. The only way to accurately understand what that means is to become a noble disciple oneself.

    >How is that even possible? The way I understand it is that the first arrow are the feelings themselves - something we have no control over.

    We have no direct control of them, but with the complete cessation of ignorance, there is the cessation of feelings, in line with *paṭiccasamuppāda.* Even the six-sense base, where the first arrow arises, is said to cease in an Arahant.

    And yet, on many occasions, we see the Buddha implicitly or explicitly stating that an Arahant still has feelings, and he obviously still perceives sense objects. Again, if that doesn't make sense, it means one's understanding is deficient. One still hasn't even seen the actual moon that all the fingers are pointing to.

    >thus, ascribing this sutta to stream entry ends up redefining stream entry outside of what the buddha specifically teaches, and invalidating a number of other suttas, and damages the dispensation by spreading false dhamma.

    No, it shows that what one currently thinks the dispensation is actually isn't, and that those other Suttas that seem "invalidated" had in reality not been sufficiently understood. The Suttas get to decide what the dispensation is, not oneself.

    >The problem with such analogies is that they apply regardless of what is being talked about.

    Of course, but the Suttas are the reference point. The "moon" they are pointing to is the only one that matters (and it *is* one and the same moon, although that can only be taken on faith initially until it's seen for oneself).

    >The only way I can currently make sense of this, is to expand the notion of *body* to include *mano*. Thus, the *citta* is free, but the *body,* which includes *mano* still has those habits and pressures that were the result of past actions.

    Yes, I suppose I should've clarified that explicitly. That's explained in more detail in the comments to my translation of the Arrow Sutta that I linked above.

    The noble disciple being free from mental (*cetasika)* suffering doesn't mean he only feels the pain of physical sensations, as it's often interpreted. It applies to mental suffering in relation to *mano* as well, and *mano* is part of the body. MN 121 uses the phrase "this very six-sensed body dependent on life", but it's often mistranslated as "the six sense bases dependent on this body", presumably on the assumption that even though the Pāli is perfectly unambiguous, *mano* cannot be part of the body. A perfect example of taking one's views instead of the Suttas as the standard.

    This ties in with the inability of one accomplished in view to take any phenomenon as self, for which I provided a reference above. That of course extends to *mano*.

    >The Buddha is on record for identifying Ānanda's weeping as an expression of sorrow and lamentation (*soka* and *parideva*) when he says, "*alaṁ, ānanda, mā soci mā paridevi"* , which the two quotes above clearly show as belonging to the *cetasikā vedanā* and not to *mano,* i.e. not to the *kāyikā vedanā*.

    The Sutta does not say that all sorrow and lamentation must be *cetasika.* The starting point of everything that the Sutta talks about is that *an unpleasant feeling* has arisen, both for a *puthujjana* and for a noble disciple. It doesn't rule out the possibility that the arisen unpleasant feeling itself will be such that the noble disciple physically cries. It also explicitly says that the noble disciple ***is*** still "struck by an arrow", which would not be an accurate description for an Arahant.

    The main point is that they lack that additional "layer" of suffering that the *puthujjana* has, and "weeping, beating one's breast, etc." is a common template expression used in other Suttas to describe that same existential type of suffering. If it were to be taken literally, anyone who—due to sheer grit and strength of character and not supramundane wisdom—never cries and keeps it together in the midst of great adversity would be free from the second arrow, which is of course nonsensical.

    [AN 5.48](https://suttacentral.net/an5.48/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=main&notes=none&highlight=false&script=latin) is another Sutta that contrasts the *puthujjana* with the *ariyasāvaka*, and says that the latter has "pulled out the poisoned arrow of sorrow", and is "sorrowless, free of thorns" in the face of loss of someone who is dear, which to some people will sound like Arahant (and of course also contradicts the account of Ānanda crying if "sorrowing" is interpreted superficially). But then it goes on to say, he is one who "fully extinguishes himself" (*attānaṃyeva parinibbāpeti),* which means he *isn't* yet an Arahant.

    Similarly, even though AN 4.184 states that someone who's free from doubt about the True Dhamma would not fear death, SN 55.21 shows Mahānāma, [who was a noble disciple](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn14#mn14:4.2), being concerned about where he would end up in his next life, clearly still being afraid of death—"sorrowing", in a way—to the point where his mindfulness becomes muddled, just like Ven. Ānanda's. That's not because the Buddha overestimated Mahānāmas development, but because the first arrow is still there. Compared with the *puthujjana*, there's no fear there. Compared with the Arahant, there is.

    >Doesn't the formulation "if I would sorrow" show that they are still subject to these things, but have gained a perspective that can actually draw them out of them, or rather, by which they can pull them out?

    You could put it like that. But the fact remains that when you have the master key for the entire prison, you can never feel trapped again, no matter what happens.

    A *puthujjana* can find a way to reliably come out of the cell that works in every situation he encounters (often within his now unwittingly heavily controlled environment, and provided there is still access to a minimum degree of comfort and sensual pleasures) thus leading to the conviction that he's a noble disciple. That's how you can have Buddhist teachers who with the utmost confidence, not even trying to deceive, declare themselves to be free from the second arrow, and yet are later found to have been continually breaking the five precepts for years on end, hiding it to boot.

    But even an ordinary person who's become so skilled at avoiding suffering will unconsciously feel the uncertainty of not having truly understood the way out. Each time they come out of the cell, however often and quickly they manage to do so, it's because somebody else (an impermanent condition within the aggregates/six senses) was kind enough to unlock the door for them. They would only realize the weight of that uncertainty once they've already dropped it, but they won't be coming closer to doing so if they assume that what they currently know *is* the genuine escape.

    From the noble disciple's perspective, the fact that the escape is *guaranteed* and rooted in genuine right understanding of feelings means that, compared to what even the skilled *puthujjana* feels, that displeasure cannot be threatening even if he wants it to. Hence the following statement:

    >“Mendicants, suppose a person was to place down on Sineru, the king of mountains, seven pebbles the size of mung beans.

    >What do you think, mendicants? Which is more: the seven pebbles the size of mung beans, or Sineru, the king of mountains?”

    >“Sir, Sineru, the king of mountains, is certainly more. The seven pebbles the size of mung beans are tiny. Compared to Sineru, it’s not nearly a hundredth, a thousandth, or a hundred thousandth part.”

    >“In the same way, compared with the achievements of a noble disciple accomplished in view, the achievements of the ascetics, brahmins, and wanderers of other religions is not nearly a hundredth, a thousandth, or a hundred thousandth part. So great is the achievement of the person accomplished in view, so great is their direct knowledge.”

    —SN 13.11

    
    That is why the Buddha describes it the way he does in the Arrow Sutta, instead of saying that the noble disciple "does" something and *then* is not hit by suffering. But when speaking to noble disciples, he didn't fail to remind them that they still have work to do and that they should be diligent and continue practicing. 

    The Dhamma is *opanayika* and *ehipassika*: it's meant to primarily push ***you*** onwards. Providing a cohesive system of intellectual principles is a secondary goal (which from my perspective it also achieves). For certain people, the latter can serve as a vehicle for the former, but for others, excessive concern with intellectual clarity gets in the way of the primary goal.

    (P.S.: In line with this,  the Arrow Sutta clearly describes the way that the Buddha wants a *puthujjana* to think about the noble disciple, while the instances of Ven. Ānanda crying and whatnot were mainly narration, not teachings. Thus, what the Arrow Sutta says should be the north star for one's practice. Having arrived there, one can put oneself in Ānanda's shoes, while at the same time seeing that the *sallasutta's* description isn't inaccurate or a "white lie".)

    I've already laid out my stance in more than enough detail in this thread for anyone who is receptive to benefit from it.

    If it still seems unacceptable to you, I would encourage you to simply put the question aside for the time being and revisit it later, after having sincerely dedicated yourself to the training that the Suttas do unambiguously describe. And, to repeat the same heuristic argument I've used elsewhere when the point fails to get across, one has nothing to gain and everything to lose from settling for a watered-down interpretation of the nature of a noble disciple. That decision has very concrete repercussions; it's not just a theoretical matter.

    It's not that it occurs "at" *sotāpatti,* in the manner of a singular experience or event, [nor is it that cessation takes time to come about](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=sn22.81). It's not like an object sliding on a surface, which needs time to come to a stop (the Dhamma is *akālika*).

    Cessation is an *understanding* that a stream-enterer already partakes in (see MN 9 and MN 38), and the only way to comprehend the cessation of suffering, the third noble truth, is to comprehend the cessation of DO.

    Insights, in the broadest sense. "Knowing and seeing things as they are".

    Often people, after gaining some sort of groundbreaking insight, end up assuming that that's what the goal was, and that now they're *sotāpannas*. But a *puthujjana* will have many dozens of such transformative recognitions on the way to *sotāpatti.* Assuming he's practicing more or less rightly, on the basis of the Gradual Training and *yoniso manasikāra*, those insights are simply a sign that he might be going in the right direction.

    You need to be able to directly know that the first three fetters have worn away, without reference to any other criterion—without needing to *infer* that because you have this new insight that seems so profound and sounds like stream-entry, the first three fetters are broken. Only then is it the real deal.

    >Does this align with the "opanayika" aspect of the Dhamma you reference above?

    It mainly refers to instructions or descriptions themselves. An instruction is accurate if following it pushes a *puthujjana* to make right efforts in the direction of stream-entry, and a *sotāpanna* to keep striving for Arahantship. But an account of all the particular behaviors and mental tendencies that a *sotāpanna* or Arahant can or would tend to exhibit would be of little use in that regard, since all the practitioner can do with that is try to emulate the effect without getting any closer to the cause, or at least "undershoot" his striving for the cause.

    In theory, the complacency part could also be interpreted as referring to a noble disciple. But it wouldn't make much sense, since even the most complacent *sotāpanna* doesn't imagine sapwood to be heartwood—it's not like he's unaware that he's still not an Arahant. That can only really happen to a *puthujjana*, who is still able to deceive himself to a large degree.

    Also, a sotāpanna [can glorify himself and put others down](https://suttacentral.net/sn8.3/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=main&notes=none&highlight=false&script=latin), but not in relation to the Right View. It's inconceivable for the mind to exercise such coarse ownership while also recalling the right understanding of non-ownership it has gained.

    The following Sutta (MN 30) might give the impression that the last item is about someone who gets the Right View but doesn't strive further to attain jhānas and formless attainments. Apart from the fact that those are not better than the Right View in themselves (SN 13.11), as seen from the question that prompted it, it's clear that the discourse is in the context of members of other sects. Those people, instead of needing to outright accept or deny the knowledge-and-vision they may have gained, would be forced to acknowledge that there is more to be done anyway. They would start practicing jhāna within the Buddha's framework and, at some point, realize how what they previously thought was wisdom was inadequate.

    >So what’s the difference between an arahant and a sotapanna then?

    From the *puthujjana's* perspective, not much (hence the Arrow Sutta). But from the *sotāpanna's* perspective, the difference is very substantial. It's similar to how a 6-year-old wouldn't be able to fathom why a 50-year-old would call a 20-year-old a "kid," but the 20-year-old would have a very palpable sense that he still has a lot to learn.

    >the sutta you linked seems focused on the four knowledges in the context of the asavas

    There isn't any mention of the four knowledges there. It's quite clear that the Buddha is talking there about how an ordinary person would come to gain the *sotāpanna's* understanding: the timeless principle by which *āsavas* immediately cease.

    A sotāpanna's practice is precisely about repeatedly bringing about the cessation and non-arising of the *āsavas*. That's in fact what *yoniso manasikāra* is about, as stated in MN 2. All the components listed in that Sutta after the first section are to be practiced with the understanding of the cessation of the *āsavas* that the *sotāpanna* has acquired. That the *sotāpanna*, by virtue of being one, understands the cessation of the *āsavas*—as well as the cessation of ignorance—is also stated in MN 9. SN 12.3 explains the right *practice* as the cessation of DO.

    So, one way of explaining the distinction is that, for the Arahant, the *āsavas* are no longer liable to future arising.

    What does "otherwise rightly" mean here? The unskilled bhikkhu has subdued greed and distress *in regard to the world*, meaning he isn't having coarse sensual or averse thoughts. But, in a subtler sense, there are still defilements there (it clearly says "The defilements are not abandoned" in the unskilled bhikkhu), and thus he cannot be said to be meditating rightly. He's *trying* to do so, but he's not sufficiently clear about what "rightness" is, and he cannot be unless he picks up the sign of the mind.

### Rebirth, Kamma, and what is even the point?

Early on in my Buddhist practice, the teachings on non-self, rebirth, and kamma were something I easily accepted. Perhaps because I came from a non-religious background so did not have an opposing world view to counter those teachings.

But recently, the more I think about these things, it makes me wonder what is even the point of attaining enlightenment, and if enlightenment is even a reality. It's my understanding that kamma is an energy that moves through samsara and we are all basically manifestations of that, but are not real beings with souls. So, are we individual "packages" of kamma, or are we even less of actual beings than that? It makes me wonder, if I will not remember this life, because I do not remember past lives, and I can not conceive of or see my future lives, then what is even the point of working towards enlightenment?

I hear teachings from some monks and they're like, "do you really want to go through the pain of living and growing up and loss all over again?" - but this question does not really make sense because if I have a future life, it will seem then like it's my first go around. Can someone please help put this all into perspective, because I'm feeling a little bit lost in my confidence in the Buddha's teachings as of late. Especially over the last few days since coming to question my practice of meditation. I feel like that was a core part of my practice.

  
Also I'm watching this and it's bringing up a lot of questions

    >It's my understanding that kamma is an energy that moves through samsara and we are all basically manifestations of that, but are not real beings with souls. So, are we individual "packages" of kamma, or are we even less of actual beings than that?

    Most of the information you will find on rebirth and kamma doesn't accord with the Suttas.

    This sort of view is very common, and it gives people a sense that from their present position, with an untrained mind, they can already make sense of what the Buddha was pointing to with the teaching of *anattā*. But there is no mention of such a doctrine, or anything that resembles it, anywhere in the Suttas. It's certainly influenced by the Abhidhammic analysis of experience as an ever-flowing sequence of mental events, each one conditioned by previous ones, because of which "there is no real being there".

    In fact, whenever the Buddha would recount one of his previous lives, he would say ["I myself was such and such at that time"](https://suttacentral.net/dn17/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=main&notes=none&highlight=false&script=latin#2.14.3).

    The Dhamma is something that "can only be seen by the wise for themselves", and so it cannot be accurately conveyed through such theoretical, explanatory views that a scientist would "agree" with and that don't require any practice to comprehend.

    >It makes me wonder, if I will not remember this life, because I do not remember past lives, and I can not conceive of or see my future lives, then what is even the point of working towards enlightenment?

    If someone comes and tells you, "I'll beat you up tomorrow, and you'll forget what happened today as well as the beat-up itself, but you'll still have the bruises and broken bones the day after and beyond", is there any point in saying no? There is nothing more esoteric about going from one life to another than going from today to tomorrow. The only significant difference is the presence of memories of what came before, but as shown by the example I gave, the absence of memories doesn't allow you to pretend in good faith that what comes later is not your problem. The fruits of your actions will still have to be experienced, and they will still hurt just as much.

    If there were no rebirth, then indeed there would be point in enlightenment. It would just be a sensual goal of getting more pleasure and avoiding pain, for no particular reason, given that you could just end it all right now without having to bother with any practice.

    But if you realize that you can't possibly prove that there *isn't* rebirth, then, if you're concerned for your own welfare, the goal of liberating your mind from passion in this life does have a valid justification. If you don't do that, and you turn out to be wrong and there *is* rebirth, you're at the mercy of the workings of *kamma* that you can't even comprehend, and you may well not get another chance to rescue yourself for who knows how long. You can assume that you will lose all the experience and knowledge you gained in this life that allowed you to protect yourself from suffering to a great degree. So you can also safely assume that if this human world is anything to go by (and clearly it can be a lot worse if you look at animals), there's a high likelihood that it won't be a fun ride.

    >Do you really believe that there are no other alternatives in your wager except Buddhist rebirth?

    I'm not really talking about "Buddhist rebirth". If we take what the average Buddhist understands by rebirth, it's not even what the Suttas are talking about, since a lot of the notions and descriptions surrounding it have come later. The Suttas make little to no pronouncements on how rebirth "works", and even say that speculation regarding that is futile.

    What the Suttas do say is necessary to have is mundane right view, which simply boils down to acknowledging that there could be a next life, and that what you do in this life will have an effect on what you experience in the next, just as what you did yesterday affects your experience today. Rejecting *that* (which would also have to be based on faith and belief) is what is an obstacle to the practice. The proliferated notions of "reincarnation" and whatnot that people usually associate with rebirth *should* be put aside, and no effort should be put into defining how exactly rebirth "happens" (the Buddha himself refrained from that).

    And the main reason why it's important is not because "belief" does anything in itself, but that, as the Buddha said, someone who holds that this life is the only one is bound to engage in misconduct of body, speech, and mind. Sure, people can have worldly morals and restrain themselves to a reasonable degree, but there is no way that they will put anywhere near the amount of effort to go "against the grain" as is required to realize the Dhamma if they believe that they will no longer experience anything after death.

    In the beginning, it can simply be regarded as a case of taking the worst case scenario for granted, which in turn is the only way that you will feel the necessary sense of urgency. If you then practice and develop your mind sufficiently, you will be free whether there is rebirth or not. But by that point you would have already seen for yourself what the Buddha meant by "renewal of existence" ("rebirth" doesn't actually correspond to any term the Buddha actually used), and it would no longer be a matter of belief. You would see that it's something that literally *cannot stop* *of its own accord,* for which you and your craving alone are responsible, and which needs to be brought to an end through effort and discernment. It's not about some sort of collective cosmic process.

    People's notions of a collective saṃsāra that we are all traveling through together, and any other such fashionable ideas about rebirth they might have adopted, are *within* the here-and-now ongoing round of existence (*bhava*) that they're not any closer to understanding.

### Noting Meditation 

Greetings everyone. Would the Mahasi Sayadaw's meditation technique of mental noting experiences and phenomenon be considered a valid meditation within the framework of what the Buddha himself taught and said about meditation? If so, how? If not, why not? 

I am looking for guidance from the suttas, not so much other people's personal opinions or good or bad experiences with this particular method.

Another thing... I have been listening to talks put out by Hillside Hermitage regarding meditation. I have a rather consistent and solid meditation practice, but am now questioning the techniques and methods I use at times. What do the Noble Ones at Hillside Hermitage recommend as a way of meditation for lay people who keep 5 precepts and celibacy, sometimes all 8 precpets, and are focused on knowing intentions and restraining senses (at the level that sometimes I still mess up, but am constantly reflecting and trying to self correct)?

Thank you all for any input.

    Any type of meditation that promises itself to be right while one is a puthujjana is intrinsically wrong, whether it's noting, watching your breath, loving-kindness mantras, or even "choiceless awareness",  simply because it won't push you to become aware of your intentions, which is where craving, the defilements, and everything you actually need to understand lies. Your mind is still subject to greed, aversion, and delusion not because you don't spend enough time "noting" or because the noting hasn't given rise to some special fruition experience, but because you don't sufficiently recognize the degree to which your own intentions, including the intention to practice noting, as well as anything else you do, say, or think, is affected with those defilements.

    Instead, you need to operate with the assumption that your own intentions are hiding from you and are sabotaging your efforts for as long as you don't see them fully (i.e., don't yet have the Right View).

    >And how does a thoroughbred meditate? A fine thoroughbred, tied up by the feeding trough, doesn’t meditate: ‘Fodder, fodder!’ Why is that? Because it occurs to the fine thoroughbred tied up by the feeding trough: ‘What task will the horse trainer have me do today? How should I respond?’ Tied up by the feeding trough they don’t meditate: ‘Fodder, fodder!’ For that fine thoroughbred regards the use of the goad as a debt, a bond, a loss, a misfortune.

    When a desire arises to go somewhere, eat something, say something, imagine something, or to practice this or that technique, become aware of *that,* investigate whether it's unskillful (which the last one always is if your goal is to see the four noble truths), don't give in to it if it is, and remain on guard for anything else that might arise. If it's not unskillful, not against the precepts, and doesn't lead to the arising of further defilements internally, you can do it.

    [Whoever has purified their behavior has done it like this](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn61), and not through noting.

    >I don't understand why the intention to practice a meditation technique is unskillful and goes against seeing the goal of seeing the four noble truths.

    Because you understand the four noble truths by upgrading your very definitions of what skillfulness and unskillfulness are. [Only a stream-enterer understands that correctly](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn9#mn9:3.1-mn9:3.2), which means that until then, the goal is to understand that very broad principle, and not to take something you *currently* think is wholesome and just go wherever it takes you.

    The fact that greed and craving appear to be absent as you engage in these practices doesn't mean they are. We start with insufficient criteria as to what the defilements even are, and there is no way to reach real freedom if you underestimate the degree to which you are actually fettered.

    You should certainly dedicate time to contemplation of the Buddha's teaching, but a "technique" is something quite different. It carries with it the implication that "I just need to do this, and understanding will somehow arise.", which is complete wishful thinking. [Some *type* of understanding would no doubt arise](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an10.105), but not the right one, since the entire endeavor is based on an unquestioned ignorance (i.e., lack of sufficient clarity of what is skillful and unskillful).

    Doing a noting practice or any other technique is in a sense better than engaging in coarse unwholesome actions and thoughts, which is why it can feel calming for most people. But that doesn't mean it's *right* or that it's what the Buddha taught. And you most certainly don't need a technique to restrain your own mind. Quite the opposite: that crutch will actively prevent you from understanding the nature of intention, taking responsibility for it, and learning what proper restraint is.

    >We actually see the defilements in and during the practice and we note the defilements when they arise as we note everything else that arises (and ceases).

    That's exactly the issue. It carries the assumption that trying to see the defilements is enough to actually see them, which, again, is not the case unless you're a sotāpanna. It doesn't matter how hard an amateur tries to watch every bird that he encounters. Even if he gets to grab every single bird with his own hand and observes it up close, the fact that his knowledge is insufficient means he won't be able to classify them reliably. So if he goes through his entire life just doing that instead of questioning the very criteria he uses to recognize the birds, he will never become an actual expert. All he will have accomplished is making thousands of inaccurate judgments.

    >Another question I have is in regards to the claim that meditation is unskillful or inappropriate for someone before stream entry. Where exactly is that laid out in the suttas?

    In many places, among them the following:

    >“There are, bhikkhus, these two powers. What two? The power of reflection and the power of development. And what, bhikkhus, is the power of reflection? It’s when someone reflects: ‘Misconduct of body, speech, or thought has a bad result both right in the present experience and in the future.’ Reflecting like this, they give up misconduct by way of body, speech, and thought, and develop good conduct by way of body, speech, and thought, keeping themselves pure. This is called the power of reflection.

    >And what, bhikkhus, is the power of development \[*bhāvana*, the word usually translated as "meditation\]? In this context, the power of development i**s the power of the trainees** \[*sekha*, which means sotāpanna or higher\]. For relying on the power of a trainee, one gives up passion, aversion, and muddledness. Having given up passion, aversion, and muddledness \[[for which it's necessary to have understood them to begin with](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn9#mn9:3.1-mn9:3.2)\], one does not do anything unskillful; one does not engage in anything harmful. This is called the power of development. These are the two powers.”

    —AN 2.11 \[the next sutta defines the "power of development" as the seven awakening factors, and SN 47.30 mentions that these are *acquired* by the stream-enterer; they are absent before that\]

    >“This mind, bhikkhus, is radiant. \* But it is blemished by adventitious defilements. The unlearned ordinary person does not understand this as it is.  Therefore I say that for the unlearned ordinary person, **there is no development of the mind.**

    >“This mind, bhikkhus, is radiant. And it is freed from adventitious defilements. A learned noble disciple understands this as it is. Therefore I say that for the learned noble disciple, there is development of the mind.”

    —AN 1.51-52

    >“Well then, mendicant, you should purify the starting point of skillful qualities. What is the starting point of skillful qualities? Well purified virtue, **and correct view.** \[a stream-enterer is called "*diṭṭhisampanna",* one endowed with (right) view\] When your virtue is well purified and your view is correct, you should develop the four kinds of mindfulness meditation in three ways, depending on and grounded on virtue.

    —SN 47.3

    The Noble Eightfold Path, which of course includes "meditation" (right effort, right mindfulness, and right samādhi) is available only to a stream-enterer:

    >Sāriputta, they speak of ‘a stream-enterer’. What is a stream-enterer?”

    >“Bhante, anyone who possesses this noble eightfold path is called a stream-enterer, the venerable of such and such name and clan.”

    —SN 55.5

    >And isn't it the case that meditation can be a helpful aid on the path leading to stream entry?

    That's an agreeable modern view, but nowhere in the Suttas is that stated. You can't cultivate or develop (the literal meaning of bhāvana) something further unless you have it in the first place. In this case, right effort and right mindfulness, both of which are absent unless there is right view.

    Also, the Buddha is simply never seen teaching mindfulness and meditation to beginner laypeople in the Suttas, as is contemporarily done. Not even to newly ordained monks, it seems (AN 5.114). He is only seen teaching it to noble ones, lay or ordained, and in some rare cases, to people who were already very developed in virtue, renunciation, and restraint. In fact, many Suttas state that sense restraint is the *precursor* to meditation (SN 46.6 is one of the most explicit examples), so if anything, the meditation part is what's optional, and the sense restraint is what's not negotiable.

    >If this is the case, does that mean everything someone engages in before stream entry is unskillful?

    From the ultimate point of view, everything they do will be affected with craving and ignorance. But of course, things will be less so than others. For example, keeping the precepts is less ignorant and unskillful than not keeping them. Being sense restrained is less ignorant and unskilful than not being so. Working their way "from the inside out" in that way ([the "Gradual Training"](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn107)) a *puthujjana* would eventually get to understand skillfulness and gain the ability to develop it further, thereby no longer being a *puthujjana*.

    >Are mundane activities like cleaning the house, going to work, etc unskillful if someone is not seeing their intention behind doing these things correctly?

    It depends on the intention. But whenever someone isn't aware of their intentions, as a rule of thumb the action will be unskillful. All it takes for unwholesome tendencies to set it is to let your guard down. You'll quickly find yourself doing things for which there isn't even a real practical purpose out of a craving for pleasure or distraction.

    But the main concern initially should be to become permanently established in the eight precepts. There may be subtler unwholesome actions that can be filtered out later, but if you're trying to restrain yourself from cleaning the house but still from time to time indulge in music,  video games, and sexual intercourse, that's like trying to filter out sand before you've filtered out large rocks.

    >the techniques are just skillful means of developing certain conditions in the mind that are more favorable for insight.

    Assuming, again, that one can trust one's initial understanding of what skillfulness is. However far back you may want to take it, the adherence to *any* pre-defined technique or method, regardless of its specifics (including our "method", in fact, if the person assumes that they're already practicing it properly) means that a certain foundational assumptions and notions are not being questioned, and it is only by questioning *that* foundation someone would have a chance of attaining the Right View. Not doing so entails an underestimation of just how profound ignorance is.

    >I invite the Venerables to be a bit more cognizant of this fact so that they can be more charitable in their criticisms.

    I know very well that we often over-simplify these methods when we discuss them. But that's not because we're not familiar with the specifics. It's because it's not the specifics that matter, but rather the very general picture. It doesn't matter what Ven. Mahasi Sayadaw or anybody else makes their method or technique about, and there is no amount of adding or taking away from the particular instructions that would make them correct. The fact is that they're (implicitly) encouraging complacency with certain parts of your present understanding that fall within wrong view, e.g., the assumption that the conditions that an absorption-style practice create are in any way favorable for insight, and the assumption that mindfulness is about observing things more closely.

    >Perhaps in near-ideal conditions, such as physically renouncing the world and such (like the Venerables), this is great advice (and even so, I wouldn't definitely rule out the usefulness of techniques), but for the vast majority of people life is just too chaotic.

    Laypeople need to make their life less chaotic first (i.e., start keeping the five precepts and be celibate at least, and reduce their involvement with unsuitable environments, activities, and people as much as possible) before they can even hope to start practicing meditation. That's why the Buddha didn't teach meditation to laypeople unless they were noble disciples already.

    >Lay life has its own "gradual training"

    The defilements don't know whether you wear robes or jeans, so this is very inaccurate. There are is also no mention of such a thing in the Suttas. Laypeople, unless they were celibate, were those who had decided that they would not fulfill the Gradual Training in this life, and not those for whom a different training had been prescribed.

    >Most important is that, as stated before, techniques and the like are not incompatible with the teachings of the Venerables. To the contrary, they might very well be appropriate (and even necessary in a lay setting), if you understand that they won't magically enlighten you, but that they will teach the mind certain skills that are useful for further development.

    Our teaching boils down to questioning what one assumes to be useful and not useful until one's view is actually correct, and only then worrying about "developing" things (and this is what the Suttas also say, as I've written in one of the replies below).

    That's still grasping at straws, in the end. The point is, there's still the assumption that your criteria and views are already accurate enough to discriminate what is what, and that whatever you're noting is really what you need to be aware of, and not something else that's also in your experience there and then.

    That's actually another highly gratuitous but unnoticed assumption that's implied. The idea that you can reduce your present experience to one clearly defined thing that can be accurately described by a single label, which is not the case. By putting the emphasis on what's being noted, which by definition won't be what really matters, everything else gets overlooked. Like the wild colt in AN 11.9 which I quoted above.

    >But if the practice is not taken up at all, then how can one hope to ever improve?

    You do have to try to improve in the skill of reigning the bad habits of your own mind. But that doesn't happen through a meditation technique, but through the Gradual Training, of which meditation proper (sitting down in solitude having made mindfulness one's priority) is found at a very late stage only. 

    Keeping the precepts and restraining your senses will bring you immeasurably closer to learning how to relate to your mind in the right way than any modern technique, and that's what the Buddha always taught. In fact, [right samādhi is born out of sense restraint,](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.97/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=main&notes=none&highlight=false&script=latin) so while it may not seem like it due to the accumulation of modern assumptions about what meditation is, practicing sense restraint is practicing meditation, while a meditation technique is a *failure* of sense restraint. You get engrossed in the details of specific sense objects, because of which you overlook other aspects of your experience.

    >Even the contemplation of intentions would not be accurate and precise at first, but through effort and practice, improvement will be made. Why would you say that contemplating intentions and meditation practice can not be developed in tandem, but rather that one needs to be mastered to a certain level before beginning the next?

    Developing both in tandem would imply a view that, on some level, meditation is about something other than seeing and restraining your intentions. It would imply that you see it more as two separate exercises rather than the same exercise performed at a higher difficulty, [which is how the Buddha saw it.](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn107#mn107:2.1-mn107:3.1)

    >Would you be able to recommend some other practice I can undertake daily that would aid me to get further on the path?

    You can strive to become accomplished in all the steps of the Gradual Training that lead up to meditation. Each of them, starting with the 8 precepts, must become a matter of permanent lifestyle, and not of occasional greater striving. That's what will uncover and familiarize you with your own defilements, not an observation technique.

    >Another thing that my mind considers is that IF meditation has been helpful to me (which I could list ways in which it has) - then how is it skillful to abandon something that has benefited me?

    In the same way as lying and killing living beings could've been very helpful for one previously, but upon taking on the precepts, one would give up any benefit that came from it, in exchange for a much more profound type of benefit that may not be immediately tangible.

    When it comes to meditation, your mind and life changed for the better probably because you gave up certain unskillful things *as a side effect of the meditation,* as happens for many people. So just give up the meditation technique itself, but don't return to the unskillful things you used to do when you didn't meditate. Then focus on finding other, more subtle unskillful things that you still do, strive to restrain those without the crutch of a technique, and your mind and life will change for the better even more eventually, even if at the time it doesn't feel good.

    >I am suggesting the possibility of using a technique and at the same time keep questioning assumptions and notions.

    You can question *some* assumptions, but not all of them and not *from the ground up*, for as long as you keep using the technique. I can be paying careful attention to the process of baking a cake, making sure to question all my assumptions about what a good cake is supposed to be like, and yet I won't be questioning whether I should be baking a cake at all, whether I should even be cooking, or whether I should even go to whatever event the cake is intended for.

    >the techniques are just a part of the whole system.

    Yes, and the whole system is predicated on unsound premises (most of the time stemming from the Commentaries and Abhidhamma) from scratch. So again, the technique itself could be something completely different; that's not what really matters. It's the assumptions behind it, i.e., the system itself.

    >So are you saying that a mind that has practiced concentration (nose tip-style), for example, 2hrs a day, for a year, is not in any conceivable way better equipped for insight?

    Not on account of the concentration practice, no, and not the right type of insight. If they have stopped engaging in unskillful actions by body, speech, and mind and begun to practice sense restraint, they are better equipped *to that degree alone*. But it's unlikely that they would not have entrenched views and expectations that will be an obstacle if they're engaging in the technique, so even if their lust and aversion have reduced circumstantially somewhat, their delusion and ignorance have increased.

    [Ignorance and wrong view are the entry point to the wrong path, culminating in wrong liberation](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an10.105), so it would actually be better for someone not to have gained those circumstantial cognitive and behavioral improvements if that means they won't have acquired more wrong views than they started with.

    >So in the mean time why don't consider some techniques that will help to start deconditioning the mind from lifelong habits?

    The answer to this is the same. The lifelong habit that's at the core of all others is ignorance and wrong view, and that one is being strengthened at the expense of all the others. If the Buddha's teaching were extinct and the only two options were either a completely ordinary life or a life devoted to meditation techniques, the latter would be better. But that isn't the case yet.

    >Just as an example consider the attention span (which in the near future might well be non-existant). Consider the degree in which people today are detached from their bodies.

    This is a good example of unquestioned assumptions that are only fed further by the practice of a technique. A short attention span is a very tangential symptom of defilements, and doesn't need to be addressed directly. Being able to concentrate on one thing for a long period of time does not imply a pure and tamed mind. A sniper can focus on his target for days on end, and yet his mind is more defiled than that of the most scatterbrained person with ADHD who doesn't break the precepts.

    >Consider the amount of mental illnesses, traumas and conditions that were just unthinkable 100 years ago (let alone 2600).

    All of that is due to the decrease in people's general virtue and the degeneration of values, not because of the decrease in attention span—a side effect that is way down the hierarchy of importance compared to many others. So the solution is still to take on the precepts and sense restraint, and to stop giving in to and proliferating one’s desires like an animal. Not a meditation technique.

    >Don't you think that these conditions are considerably more complex, so that certain compromises for skillful use of certain techniques are appropriate in the "lay path"?

    Practicing the Dhamma is harder now than it was before, yes. But the solution is to try harder to bring oneself to where it is, being even more careful about making compromises than laypeople back in the day were, rather than watering down the Dhamma so that one can access it without having to make significant changes to one's life first.

    >How can I ever manage to stick with that intention knowing how much pain it's going to cause?

    By [clarifying your liability to suffering](https://suttacentral.net/sn3.25/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=main&notes=none&highlight=false&script=latin), fostering a sense of urgency, and getting your mind to recognize that [the pain that comes from not doing it](https://suttacentral.net/an4.115/en/thanissaro?lang=en&reference=main&highlight=false)—not necessarily in the near future, but when sickness, aging, loss, and death come—will be much worse. A drug addict needs to feel sufficiently dissatisfied with his current state and where it's leading him in order to be able to endure the pains of withdrawal.

    And that's one of the many shortcomings of contemporary meditation approaches. They're generally not rooted in the sense of urgency that the Suttas so often emphasize is indispensable. People who are content with them rarely if ever regard stream entry[ as a matter of life and death](https://suttacentral.net/sn56.35/en/bodhi?lang=en&reference=main&highlight=false), not even realizing the precarious situation that they find themselves in, as victims to the inevitability of the loss of everything that's dear to them due to their proliferated attachments.

    That's why it's not uncommon for the practice to become compartmentalized from the other aspects of their daily life, which happen to be precisely where they make their minds even wilder and less capable of enduring loss and disappointment. In many cases, the goal of the meditation is simply to "minimize" suffering and increase happiness as much as possible, but you don't need a fully awakened Buddha and his Dhamma to achieve that. That's already the goal of every mundane pursuit, sensual ones in particular.

    >Do you have any advice on how to determine what is gradual vs going too quickly or slowly when it comes to sense restraint?

    You just make sure that you follow the [Gradual Training](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gBSOK_8fXA) in the order that the Buddha prescribed it. Get your mind used to keeping the 8 precepts first and foremost (or the first five if you still break them sometimes), unbroken and *unconditionally*, not just when you feel inspired. Don't force yourself to sit in an empty room for 6 hours a day and give in to no unwholesome intentions whatsoever straight off the bat (you won't succeed because you don't even see your intentions clearly).

    >And... do I need to sort out my intentions first in order to be successful with this kind of practice?

    The Gradual Training follows the sequence that it does precisely because it's about becoming aware of your intentions on subsequently more refined levels. Right now, you may not be fully clear about the full subtlety of what thoughts are rooted in craving and what thoughts aren't, but you know for sure that breaking a precept by body or speech involves more craving than not doing so. So you restrain your craving on that level, and once you become proficient, you are ready to move on to the next stage of sense restraint, which already starts to reign in some of the coarsest unwholesome mental actions.

    Yes, I'm aware of that Sutta. It's quite possible for a puthujjana to reach a point where they've dialed in the previous aspects of the Gradual Training (at least as far as they can tell) and yet still don't have the Right View. At that stage, they can take on the *satipaṭṭhānas* as a practice, but the person teaching would have to judge where the listener currently stands. If they have the usual tendency most of us start with today, of assuming that their practice of *satipaṭṭhāna* starts out being already correct, then it would be counterproductive to approve of that. 

    But if they have the attitude of, as it says there, practicing that *so that they can get to understand the body as it is* (which implies the authentic admission that they still don't), it would be beneficial provided they've reined in all the other things that cloud the mind through virtue and restraint. Provided they keep questioning their understanding at the root level and don't just take it for granted, they would gain the Right View once they rightly understand the *satipaṭṭhānas.*

    >the noting technique is helping me to see more clearly than if I weren't using it at all

    Nobody can deny that. The problem is that the sort of intention you really need to see to get the Right View—the "root" passion, aversion, and delusion acting as a foundation for everything else—is in the very act of trusting in and performing the technique. Whatever the technique reveals to you will not be able to override the fact that all of it is born out of a more general unwholesome intention of delusion.

    >are indicative of the understanding of a noble disciple, who is endowed with *ariyakanta*-*sīla*. Could we perhaps take this passage as referring to someone who is on the path towards stream entry, but has still not accomplished ethical discipline fully?

    The *dhammanusāri* and *saddhānusāri* are also noble disciples, [irreversibly established in the path to Nibbāna](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn34#mn34:10.1-mn34:10.2),  and [also possessing the five faculties including wisdom](https://suttacentral.net/sn48.12/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=sidebyside&reference=main&notes=none&highlight=false&script=latin), but they haven't yet fulfilled the four factors of stream-entry and abandoned the first three fetters completely. That's what some Suttas refer to as[ "the sure path in regard to beneficial qualities".](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an5.152)

    Case in point is [Sarakāni, the noble disciple who was an alcoholic](https://suttacentral.net/sn55.24/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=sidebyside&reference=main&notes=none&highlight=false&script=latin).

    Now of course, the caveat is that anyone can say "I have great faith in the Dhamma or "I have a good ntellectual grasp of it", but that doesn't at all mean that what they have faith or an intellectual grasp of is correct, especially nowadays that there are so many mutually contradictory teachings, all which get to pass as "Dhamma". And even if they do have good faith/reasoning of the "right" Dhamma externally, it doesn't mean that internally they interpret it properly.

    In other words, *sotāpattimagga* is already an extraordinary achievement that only a limited minority of people would get to, even if all the Dhamma instruction in the world was perfectly in line with the Buddha's.

    Edit: Also, the expression "of bad virtue" (*dussīla)* could be referring to an actual sotāpanna who doesn't break the five precepts, but still engages in sensuality externally and isn't celibate. That would actually fit better with the context of AN 10.75, which explicitly mentions celibacy.

But in order to use that criterion properly, one must keep in mind that one's interpretation of the Suttas can and often will be inaccurate, and so it's only the broad strokes that you'll be able to ascertain for sure. For example, whether they teach, at least implicitly, that it's remotely possible to have *samādhi* or *jhānas* without a lifestyle of permanent virtue and sense restraint. Even if "virtue" here means only five precepts (though it's actually 8, or at least 5 with celibacy), this criterion already disqualifies the majority of modern teachers, even in the Early Buddhism scene.

    Also, do they need to bend the Suttas in order to support their narrative, and implement "patchwork" ideas that the Suttas never even mention (the concept of mind-moments and experience consisting of a "flux" of events, the idea that someone can meet with roadblocks in their practice due to  "energy blockages", past *kamma*, or lack of familiarity with a methodical technique, and not because their act out of craving in their daily life, etc.)? [True Dhamma must be free from patchwork,](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn22#mn22:42.1-mn22:42.2) and must not require the use of mental gymnastics and carry the implication that the Buddha forgot to mention things that were actually very important. This means operating with the basic premise that the Buddha was the unsurpassed teacher, and if something was in any way relevant, he already said it with the degree of detail that was necessary.

    In the rare event that somebody passes that test, they may be someone whose teaching *is* in line with the Dhamma at least as far as you can currently tell, but who may be overestimating themselves and setting the bar for what constitutes liberation too low ([which happened even in the Buddha's time ](https://suttacentral.net/mn105/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=sidebyside&reference=main&notes=none&highlight=false&script=latin)when there wasn't any counterfeit Dhamma, so of course it can happen now). But at the very least, in following that teaching you wouldn't be completely wasting your time, since it would emphasize the right things and lead to *some* taming of the mind.

    The next filter would be to scrutinize them personally to see whether any passion, aversion, or delusion is found in them, as described in MN 95. For that, you'd ideally need to visit them and get to know them. Someone who sees the Dhamma wouldn't just be able to explain it very well, but they would also personally free from any qualities that go against it.   
      
    [And if two teachers seem to be teaching largely the same thing but one of them lives in remote forest dwellings while the other one doesn't, the former is the safer bet.](https://suttacentral.net/mn150/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=main&notes=none&highlight=false&script=latin)

    And the final criteria would be, if both teachers are forest dwellers, whose teaching is subtler, more profound, and requires more dedication, time, perseverance, and effort to realize, and which appears to be more accessible, more lenient, easier to understand, and more compatible with[ things that are not in line with the Dhamma.](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an8.53) The former would be the way to go in every case. Out of any two paths, the one that is subtler, harder to comprehend, and goes more "against the grain" will always be closer to the Noble Eightfold Path. The Buddha didn't even feel inclined towards revealing it initially, being sure that nobody else in this world could possibly understand such a profound teaching.

    But, at the end of the day, especially now that there are *undeniably* counterfeits (if you get 10 USD bills with 10 different colors, and meanwhile [all real bills are supposed to have one and only one color](https://suttacentral.net/mn104/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=main&notes=none&highlight=false&script=latin#5.2), either all of them are fake, or only one of them is genuine) and the Saṅgha is already as fragmented as it can be, there is no foolproof way to tell. You can at most decrease your changes of going wrong, albeit by an immense margin. But again, if a teacher at least emphasizes what the Suttas emphasize (virtue, restraint, renunciation, and not meditation techniques, contrived mystical or new-age concepts, or poetic ideas) you won't be completely wasting your time.

    >which, as the suttas indicate, and you and Ajahn Ñāṇamoli constantly emphasize, implies unbroken *sīla* and sense restraint.

    Not necessarily sense restraint, though. That's part of the indispensable *training* for *sotāpatti* and for any attainment higher than that.

    A *sotāpanna* would keep at least the five precepts, but they can end up living more laxly than is required to make significant further progress, like basically all incelibate noble disciples in the Suttas, [including devas](http://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn37).

### When is it Upekkha and when is it laziness? 

 I've been trying to develop Upekkha, but very often remaining equanimous to certain things has a flavor of just being lazy or of the "it's going to be fine anyway" wrong view. How can I tell the difference between Upekkha and just wishful thinking that everything will be fine? 

 Thank you all!

    > How can I tell the difference between Upekkha and just wishful thinking that everything will be fine? 

    By not trying to "do" what you now think upekkha is, and instead focusing on developing virtue, sense restraint, awareness of your intentions, and becoming a sotāpanna first. That may be a more disquieting endeavor compared to your current idea of equanimity, but is in reality much closer to upekkha.

    Any equanimity you have not based on those prerequisites will be wishful thinking. It will be the equanimity based on the household life and not on renunciation, as the Buddha says in MN 137.

    The key is that, in all three cases, he abides "unflooded" (*anavassuta),* which means his mind isn't touched by any of those arisen feelings.

    But yes, any intellectual understanding of that (the cessation of contact) will be a misconceiving to some extent. It needs to be realized.

### Restraint and discipline is tiring me?

I've since forever felt this resistance to restraint in my daily life. No matter what it is, "something" starts to feel bad after I've restrained myself for a while. Sometimes, it's to the point that I've felt that I'll die of a heart attack or something.

For example, I'm studying or working on something, and for this, I need to sit on a chair for long hours, with full attentiveness. Let's say at least for four or five hours. I'll naturally start getting restless after half an hour, feeling anxious, etc., so I might have to get up and "walk it off".  This clearly sucks because it's taking me away from deep work, not to mention trapping me with a bad habit of giving in to pressure.

Let's not even talk about other escapes like sexuality, social media, etc. I might be able to ward off for a while, but then I start getting tired from this. Finally, after a point of time, they can easily overpower me.

So starting today, what I can do to improve? How can I stand against the pull of ANY distraction, no matter how tired I feel, which I will invariably face again tomorrow?

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1esyjg6/restraint_and_discipline_is_tiring_me/licut4d/)** _2024-08-16 04:28:10:

    You shouldn't be worrying about something as minute as an intention to get up and walk if you still break the 8 precepts from time to time. If you do, it's almost guaranteed that you'll be acting from a place of adhering to an arbitrary observance (which is basically what self-mortification is), instead of actually seeing an unwholesome intention and restraining it. That's why[ the Buddha instructed people to train gradually](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gBSOK_8fXA) instead of trying to restrain every single unskillful intention right off the bat, which is not possible because you start being able to see only the very coarsest ones, and the subtler ones will be a complete hit-or-miss.

    So what you can do starting today to improve is determine to dial in the very first step: never breaking the 8 precepts again (and that might take a while).  Do your best with all the rest, but don't expect it to be anywhere near perfect before you are accomplished in basic virtue.

### Enduring the pressure correctly

Let's say, as a really simple example, that I am sitting down and not engaging with anything else on an external level.  Just sitting still, that's it.  And then, I have a really strong urge to stand up.  I'm using this example because it's so simple, this could equally apply to more coarse situations like an urge to smoke cigarettes.

In this situation, I am guaranteed to be experiencing an unpleasant SENSATION of pressure.  I am also probably going to have thoughts ringing out that are trying to push me towards action in one direction or another.  Now, this all kind of reminds me of an example I read on here recently, where Venerable Nanavira was speaking about his experience quitting cigarettes.  He mentions how, after quitting, he quickly found himself thinking "I know I can stick to my resolve not to smoke again, but I really need to smoke another cigarette to be sure this is the right way to go."  Similarly, I often find myself in a situation like this, where a pressure is occurring, I know that I just need to not follow the obvious direction it is trying to take me, and that's all that I need to be *doing.*  Hence, if I just keep sitting down and that's  my only external action, in the case where the urge is to stand up, then I can kind of rest easy knowing that I'm legitimately enduring the pressure correctly.

Now here's where it gets confusing to me. Sometimes, I experience a more ambiguous type of pressure, it doesn't have clear directionality, but it's just saying that I need to do something\*.\*  There are two questions that I have about this:

1. Is it true to say that the perceived directionality is because of thinking and pondering related to the pressure?  As in, I am connecting two unconnected domains, and believing that the thoughts related to the pressure are actually related to it, when they actually aren't?  For instance, if you have an itch, your natural inclination is to scratch it.  But what if your natural inclination was to jump up and down, thinking that was the best solution -- you'd never even thought of scratching in the first place, just jumping.  It's the same itch, but "acting out" or going with the grain seems to take two different forms depending on your perception of it, which is formed by thought.
2. Experientially, is it true that I should just remain aware of the whole experience, not even just the pressure, but certainly not without the pressure I know is there, and not do anything else?  It seems like that is ultimately the best thing I can do when I'm under pressure to act out of unwholesome.  I keep finding myself feeling so overwhelmed because I'm not sure whether I'm just implicitly acting out by having xyz thoughts, or what even directly constitutes acting out at all.  This is especially difficult when I consider point 1, which posits that there may be no real directionality at all, so "acting out" would simply mean doing anything with the intention to distract yourself from the pressure.  
3. One thing I have contemplated for a while is that, given that the entire body(1) (and hence, my body(2) experience as a whole -- using the terminology bhante Anigha used in his Yoniso Manasikhara essay, where body(1) is the more fundamental object in the world) is subject to death and thus directly unownable, it is possible that no thinking and pondering, no sensations, nothing on that body(2) level can actually be my action on an immediate level, my action is something that comes *after* that.  But does it have to be volitional?  On what level do I *choose* to make this or that action, what is the threshold?  So is it just that assumption or ayoniso attention that turns natural thinking and pondering into the *act* of thinking and pondering?  Or is it that, since you implicitly can say no to thoughts, can turn your direction elsewhere, you are acting simply by experiencing them?  Without understanding the line of action more clearly, I'm having a lot of trouble enduring the hindrances, even though I see how terrible and often unbearable the pressure of sensuality actually is.  It really is exactly like racketeering, it's honestly very horrific because pretty much every single thing I habitually "want" to do has this exact same dynamic, this exact same pressure underlying it.  It's like my world is made of sharp stones.

To rephrase what I said above - when I'm met with an unpleasant abiding, I know that it's wrong to act towards ignoring it or trying to get rid of it.  What happens is that since I don't understand the line between acting and not acting with enough clarity, my ability to endure without actually acting chips away as the perception that I am implicitly acting out due to the arising of phenomena grows stronger.  If I had to guess, I would say that perhaps I just need to endure that too, and I'm still not acting out until I make a conscious choice.  But I could easily be wrong.

    It sounds like you're severely overthinking things and are not realizing that you've already gone down the rabbit hole of restlessness and doubt. Even if the ideas you arrive at are theoretically correct, they won't be so *internally* because they're coming through a mind of doubt.

    What you should do is not try to stop feeling the pressure or stop thinking, but see the whole barrage of doubts, uncertainties, and questions that present themselves as being of the utmost importance as *one thing* that's trying to bait you away from the right context, and then let that pressure endure for as long as it wants without going out to welcome it *or* fight with it at any point. [Like a tortoise that draws its limbs into its shell when the jackal comes to eat it.](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.240/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=none&notes=none&highlight=false&script=latin)

### Logic behind restraint and non-restraint

I've heard multiple times that giving into craving further perpetuates it. Why is that the case? I understand that intuitively through empirical observations, but there's still a sense of doubt with regards to it. Also, is abstinence supposed to naturally ward off the craving? Similarly, why?

Say there's a pleasant prospect present, the recognition of that prospect is felt unpleasantly and there is resistance towards it naturally; i.e., there is a sense of "I want to go towards that thing" either physically or mentally. What is right endurance here? What makes that endurance "right" as opposed to other kinds of endurances?

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1elmlvg/logic_behind_restraint_and_nonrestraint/lgxqglf/)** _2024-08-07 13:36:44:

    >Also, is abstinence supposed to naturally ward off the craving? Similarly, why?

    Not in itself, because in the end abstinence always pertains only to specific things. You can move your craving away from specific things simply by abstaining from them, but that's not the Dhamma yet, that's just virtue, and craving would still linger on a deeper level that may not be blatantly reflected by your actions.

    What abstinence does is "contain" craving, which is the stepping stone for discerning it, and only once you discern it can you truly destroy it. If you live perfectly restrained but assume that's all you need to do, you won't be looking further for the actual *root* of those things that you abstain from.

    >Say there's a pleasant prospect present, the recognition of that prospect is felt unpleasantly and there is resistance towards it naturally; i.e., there is a sense of "I want to go towards that thing" either physically or mentally. What is right endurance here? What makes that endurance "right" as opposed to other kinds of endurances?

    Endurance becomes "right" when it's done from the understanding that the way you feel is not the issue, but rather the impulse to *act* out of the way you feel. The rightness or wrongness is not determined by what you do.

    So for example, the severe fasting some ascetics in the Buddha's time did is not in itself wrong. The problem is that more often than not the view behind it is that you’ve developed your mind when you no longer perceive the hunger and discomfort anymore, almost like some sort of soldier.

    But the person practicing right endurance sees the problem as the fact that their mind is affected by (= wants to act out of) the physical and emotional unpleasantness of abstinence, as opposed to whether the abstinence itself is unpleasant. So if someone is abstaining from some unwholesome action and is in terrible emotional distress on account of it, there is no problem at all for as long as they're not doing anything by body, speech, or mind to alleviate that discomfort (which includes telling themselves to "endure it" with the hope that it will subside).

    And that's the type of endurance that develops your mind so that nothing can ever overpower it, without needing to manage the way you feel about anything. In other words, it's not about *not being challenged* by things, but about not craving no matter how intense the challenge is. The former can be achieved through sheer willpower, the latter can only ever arise from wisdom.

    >“Suppose, friend, there was a stone pillar eight meters long. Four meters would be below ground and four meters above ground. If a violent rainstorm should then arrive from the east, it would not shake it or make it quake, wobble, and tremble; if a violent rainstorm should then arrive from the west … from the north … from the south, it would not shake it or make it quake, wobble, and tremble. For what reason? Because the stone pillar is deep in the ground and is securely planted. So too, friend, when a bhikkhu is thus perfectly liberated in mind, even if powerful forms cognizable by the eye come into range of the eye … Even if powerful phenomena cognizable by the mind come into range of the mind, they do not obsess his mind; his mind is not at all affected. It remains steady, attained to imperturbability, and he recognizes its vanishing.”  
    —AN 9.26

    \[Note the subtle difference from "no powerful forms, etc. come into range”, which is what people tend to subconsciously expect\].

    And that's also how the Dhamma is "timeless" (*akālika)*: you need time to change the way you feel, whereas right endurance is always presently achievable no matter how you feel.

### Am I practicing the right way?

My practice is to be relaxed and at ease with the right attitude and awareness of what is happening. The attitude I am talking about is the one that allows me to tolerate what is occurring in the present moment without any aversion to it or strong desire. I try to develop this type of awareness constantly. I also develop this awareness by asking questions.

I have noticed that developing this awareness allows me to let go of sensuality more (for example, I have noticed less interest in sexuality). I have also noticed that in situations where I have contact with other people I behave better. For example, quite recently I had a situation when I was talking to a family member who said something that upset me and I noticed this growing aversion. I did not react with aggression to this stimulus, but I behaved in a calm way.

Is it worth continuing this practice if there are results in improving morality and peace?

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1elckwf/am_i_practicing_the_right_way/lgxiwx1/)** _2024-08-07 12:49:28:

    >My practice is to be relaxed and at ease with the right attitude and awareness of what is happening. The attitude I am talking about is the one that allows me to tolerate what is occurring in the present moment without any aversion to it or strong desire.

    If that attitude automatically makes you keep the precepts and not act on sensual, averse, or distracting intentions, then it could be along the right lines. But if you are able to maintain that type of awareness while also acting in such ways in your day-to-day life, it’s for that very reason not the right type of awareness. The Buddha taught "awareness" and meditation[ with restrained conduct as a non-negotiable prerequisite.](https://suttacentral.net/sn47.3/en/bodhi?lang=en&reference=none&highlight=false)

    Ultimately, however, the goal should be to refine and improve your definition of what the "right attitude" is, and not assume that you already have it. That's how you progress towards the Right View.

    Quite often, the Buddha said that one who understands the five aggregates/six senses as suffering becomes fully liberated, i.e., one who sees the first truth also realizes all others at least to the necessary degree. 

    The Pāli Suttas ultimately summarize the first noble truth as the five assumed aggregates. If the first truth is taken in a more superficial sense, along the lines of "we are subject to loss, pain, and misfortune", then one could argue that won't automatically lead to seeing the others. But then it'd be a stretch to call it a *noble* truth, as many people see that even without the Dhamma. 

    >It is interesting how He had to explain each truth **separately** and they were set forth separately.

    The fact that they can be separated in *explanation* (which is why they were made into four) doesn't mean that one can understand suffering as it really is without also understanding its cessation, and vice versa. The explanation of each individual one sheds light on all the others.

    >I wonder, is it possible that both ideas (*immediate vs gradual understanding*) are both true in different circusmtances?

    It's not a question of immediate vs gradual. It's the fact that to the degree that a person sees any of the truths (which can and usually would take a long time) they also see all the others. Most people will end up needing more explanation than just one truth, but that's because they don't fully see what the explanation was pointing to right away.

### Step by step?

As I currently understand what you are teaching about the gradual training, it is necessary to go step by step in the correct order so as not to unconsciously engage in dukkha management. What I am having trouble understanding is how moderation in eating comes after sense restraint, since isn't immoderate eating (with sensuality at least) tainted with "grasping at the signs and features"? Or is this stage mainly to purify the other unskillful motives for eating (bulking up, beautification)? Also, if lack of accomplishment in virtue basically includes acting on \*any\* unskillful motives through body or speech, wouldn't improper eating already be filtered out through that? Or if not then, through sense restraint? What am I missing?

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1ec6a9u/step_by_step/lezt2vf/)** _2024-07-26 06:10:37:

    The entire gradual training should be understood as a refinement of the same principle of being able to see unwholesome impulses and not acting out of them.

    In the case of moderation in eating, how to eat with the right attitude would become apparent if you're already skilled in sense restraint, because by then you would have learned that the problem is not the signs and features themselves (in this case the pleasant tastes and experiences related to food) but the "grasping" at those. You can make sense of that in theory, but before sense restraint has been developed, there would be a subconscious tendency to deny the signs and features instead of simply not grasping at them, failing to see where the danger actually lies, and that safety has to be found amidst that which is dangerous (the simile of the deer herd in MN 25).

    Regarding the second question, in theory yes, but in practice no. Someone who's advanced would be able to see the whole sequence of stages as a unity and would no longer think of them individually, but a person who's just starting out with virtue won't be able to see the subsequent aspects with sufficient accuracy to purify them reliably. They can surely try, but it's likely that they'll end up denying things most of the time. Hence the need to go step by step.

    So one should think of "purity" in relative terms, in relation to which stage they're at. For a person who's at the stage of virtue, their body and speech being restrained, to whichever extent they are aware of that, counts as "purity". Once that becomes the norm, they can begin to look for the subtler impurities that are still found within that, which would be lack of sense restraint, and at point they will see clearly for themselves how to address that as opposed to just blindly following an external instruction to do this instead of that.

    You are able to work at any of the "stages" only when you see that the unwholesome intentions on that respective level cannot arise by accident, and that it's always you who lets them in. Whenever you try to work beyond where you're presently at, it will tend to feel like you're fighting against something that imposes itself over you outside your control because you still can't see your own intentions on that deeper level, and so even if you're precisely following the right instruction on paper, it will devolve into a mechanical management method done without real understanding. The widespread misconception that the hindrances are particular thoughts that come to you against your will and require absorption on a meditation object for dispelling is based on an insufficient development of the prerequisites for abandoning the hindrances.

    >is the measure for completion is one’s own mind’s response to that? I.e. being able to abide in non-remorse,

    Yes, you are no longer *liable* to remorse at least to that extent, because now you're clear as to where the faults and transgressions come from, and that it's fully on you and your intentions, not on the specifics of an external standard (which you start with, but the goal is to see deeper than that).

    >Because it seems like the actual specifics of one’s precepts will have to vary based on what strata of society one finds oneself in and what is considered proper or improper based on the standards of the society,

    The specifics of one's external precepts will vary, but greed, aversion, and delusion are the same for everyone, and they arise internally. So, whether a layperson or a monk, the internal situation must be the same: that they have discerned how to ensure that no present action is accompanied by an unwholesome mental state, regardless of their different circumstances ([sexual activity cannot be wholesome, however](http://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn22)). Sometimes, either of them will have to exceed their prescribed standard in order to accomplish that, sometimes not. But again, they would no longer be thinking in terms of external guidelines and instead in terms of their own intentions. That's how the Saṅgha operated without any rules for many years.

    >At the end of sense restraint description too, the suttas describe one feeling blameless happiness. And similarly with completion of the five hindrances stage. So then is the whole of the GT is just a successive surmounting of the previous stage using the same principle you mentioned above (being able to see unwholesome without acting on it) even through the four jhānas and beyond, with the standard of completion being internal in each case as opposed to an external authority?

    Yes, it's the same principle of blameless happiness that [extends all the way to Arahantship as well.](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an3.63#an3.63:10.2-an3.63:10.13) Realizing that suffering and defilement cannot possibly come to you by accident, due to some external condition, or because something in your mind happened "too fast for you to catch it".

    It's more likely that a person who still puts the emphasis on those things still has a ways to go before actually becoming accomplished in virtue (i.e., having the necessary degree of discernment of their own intentions and of how they determine the character of their actions) even if they keep the rules impeccably. *That's why* they would still be mistakenly seeing those things as relevant to the practice, and not by accident.

### Questions on Jhāna

Is it not theoretically possible that one could attain jhāna without having gone through the gradual training (e.g. Prince Siddhartha as a young boy, or various devatas)? As such would it be legitimately jhāna but (not being rooted in the complete gradual training and achieved, say, through meditation techniques) simply more dependent on certain conditions (birth in heaven, being on a meditation retreat) and therefore less useful for total release. Or in your view is anyone who attains such a state not truly secluded from unwholesome states and therefore not in jhāna even though they might think they are? In other words, is it possible that using the gradual training as the basis for samādhi is not the only way to reach jhāna but simply the way the Buddha taught it for the sake of permanent freedom? Thank for taking the time.

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1ec693c/questions_on_jhāna/lezrn2r/)** _2024-07-26 05:56:18:

    It's possible to attain jhāna without being permanently established in renunciation and the gradual training. But the nature of the jhāna itself would be no different, and so it can never be achieved through a meditation technique, which by definition goes in the opposite direction. 

    Somebody can be doing the right things for a while without fully understanding why they're right, i.e. not breaking the precepts, living restrained, seeing sensuality as unsatisfactory, and regarding their experience through a broader context in the right way without denying it or absorbing themselves into some separate object. Because of all this, their minds would be to an extent "separating" from sense objects, and they could have a one-off experience of jhāna. But one experience of jhāna doesn't magically do anything in itself; jhānas are[ just pleasant abidings here and now as the Buddha said](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn8#mn8:4.1-mn8:4.5). 

    *Proficiency* in jhāna or being able to attain it repeatedly is what reveals that a person sees the signs of their mind and comprehends the nature of wholesome and unwholesome to a great degree. Consequently, they would need very little instruction to get the right view, which is nothing other than that same understanding being fully cemented in all its implications. The Bodhisatta had jhāna as a child once, and it's clear that he didn't fully understand how to get it again.

    No absorption practice can ever develop that, and if you look closely, they always depend on a wrong assumption about what the problem is: "These *objects* are the cause of my sensuality, aversion, etc., and therefore I must replace them until they no longer arise". There is a wrong view about what craving and the three poisons are right off the bat, and the culmination of wrong view is wrong samadhi (AN 10.105). So it actively takes you away from the middle way.

    >So in those cases like the Bodhisatta it’s fair to say that at that time due to past kamma and (at the very least) lack of unwholesome input from present kamma *secluded* them from Wrong View, sensuality and the rest of the unwholesome domain.

    Yes, but past kamma in the sense of his mind not being as defiled and immersed in unwholesome states, and not in the sense of "meditation skills" that have nothing to do with the defilements carrying over from a past life. And it cannot have been an accident; he *needs* to have been [practicing sense restraint](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=sn35.97) correctly, and [seeing the danger in sensuality](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an6.73) for jhāna to come about. Jhāna is when the senses have been temporarily tamed, and that doesn't just happen out of the blue.

    >But without having necessarily “fulfilled”Right View and perhaps other prerequisites, their experiences however genuine the jhāna might be, don’t count has having “fulfilled” Right Samādhi?

    Correct. At that time, he didn't understand that he was practicing in line with the middle way, and how and why that path led to the complete end of suffering.

    >Whereas those who practice an absorption meditation technique wouldn’t even count as secluded from Wrong View?

    Someone who enters jhāna doesn’t necessarily have right view to the full extent. But they do have enough discernment of what is wholesome and what is unwholesome as far as the hindrances go to have engaged in right effort for a period of time. An absorption technique attempts to bypass that need for discernment, and assumes that keeping your mind fixed on the object is intrinsically wholesome when it very much isn't. It's actually a lack of sense restraint: getting immersed in the details and particularities of an object.

### How difficult is it for a sotapanna to reach sakadagami or anagami?

[deleted]

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1e9is7j/how_difficult_is_it_for_a_sotapanna_to_reach/lehpm87/)** _2024-07-23 03:41:49:

    >sotapanna may be likely to be attainable within a few months

    If it's the real deal, it will take much longer for a monk, let alone a layperson. 

    How long it takes depends on 1) how much "dust" the person has in their eyes (accumulation of defilements and wrong views) and 2) the quality, not just the intensity, of effort they put in to not act out of those defilements, and to leave no stone unturned when questioning their wrong views. For most of us today, both of these metrics aren't very good, and for a layperson, the second one will almost always be less than optimal.

    An "experience" you get after practicing intensively for months is not what makes you a *sotāpanna*. Having sufficiently trained yourself to stop overlooking the sign of your mind/your intentions, having abandoned *all* of your wrong views, and having developed unshakable faith in the Triple Gem and spotless virtue that is not clung to is what does (the four aspects of *sotāpatti* often listed in the Suttas). The fruit of stream entry is the result of *you* having done that work beforehand, for as long as it had to be done depending on your starting point (that you wouldn't be able to gauge except in hindsight), as opposed to "The Experience" being what "transforms" you.

    The same applies for higher attainments.

    >“Mendicants, a farmer has three urgent duties. What three? A farmer swiftly makes sure the field is well ploughed and tilled. Next they swiftly plant seeds in season. When the time is right, they swiftly irrigate or drain the field. These are the three urgent duties of a farmer. That farmer has no special power or ability to say: ‘Let the crops germinate today! Let them flower tomorrow! Let them ripen the day after!’ But there comes a time when that farmer’s crops germinate, flower, and ripen as the seasons change.

    >

    >In the same way, a mendicant has three urgent duties. What three? Undertaking the training in the higher virtue, the higher mind, and the higher wisdom. These are the three urgent duties of a mendicant. That mendicant has no special power or ability to say: ‘Let my mind be freed from defilements by not grasping today! Or tomorrow! Or the day after!’ But there comes a time—as that mendicant trains in the higher virtue, the higher mind, and the higher wisdom—that their mind is freed from defilements by not grasping.

    >

    >So you should train like this: ‘We will have keen enthusiasm for undertaking the training in the higher virtue, the higher mind, and the higher wisdom.’ That’s how you should train.”  
    —AN 3.92

    >  
    Suppose there was a hen with eight or ten or twelve eggs. And she properly sat on them to keep them warm and incubated. Even if that hen doesn’t wish: ‘If only my chicks could break out of the eggshell with their claws and beak and hatch safely!’ Still they can break out and hatch safely. Why is that? Because that chicken with eight or ten or twelve eggs properly sat on them to keep them warm and incubated.  
      
    In the same way, even though a bhikkhu who is committed to development might not wish: ‘If only my mind was liberated from the influxes through non-assumption!’ Even so, his mind is liberated from the influxes through non-assumption. Why is that? You should say: ‘Because of development’. Development in what? Development in the four establishments of recollection, the four right efforts, the four bases of spiritual ability, the five faculties, the five powers, the seven awakening factors, and the noble eightfold path.

    >Suppose a carpenter or his apprentice sees the marks of his fingers and thumb on the handle of his adze. He doesn’t know how much of the handle was worn away today, how much yesterday, and how much previously. He just knows ‘it’s worn away’ once it’s already worn away.

### What does "self" mean?

The average secular or atheistic westerner understands that we're made of components, and that the body regulates itself, they know and agree that we're a bunch of chemicals that can be altered with drugs as many take antidepressants, yet they still believe in a self. So what does self actually mean, both in the real world and suttas?

Does self in the suttas mean having *absolute control*? Because I think most don't think we have absolute control over our bodies/mind, hence people talk about intrusive thoughts, or getting dementia, or some other condition where control is lost.

Does it mean having *partial control*? I think most people believe in this, that if we eat the right foods we can prevent diseases, so we have a partial control over our bodies. But does no-self mean believing we don't have partial control?

Or is it more nuanced? Control over that process which selects and acts on thoughts which are deemed non-intrusive, aka intentions. I.e. intrusive thoughts are not me, but that process that accepts thoughts and turns them into action, is me.

 Maybe it specifically has to do with control over feelings? Perhaps  self means control over mental suffering and feelings? That if one indulges in something pleasant, bad feelings which are "mine" can be eliminated, and good feelings which are "mine" can be arisen. I.e. "I am" feeling bored, therefore if I eat a snack, I will feel pleasant, and no longer bored.  So this is a level of confidence of control over feelings, and eliminating suffering like boredom. 

Then again, self cannot mean control because the dhamma is about removing suffering, so we do have control, or is no-self simply control without a label "self", in which case what does "self" mean then?



Is there anything else that demonstrates a self? What does self really mean?

My clearest most rational definition is that I don't choose to suffer, therefore suffering is no-self. Anything that I choose that doesn't increase suffering can be self/no-self doesn't matter how you define it, but suffering is **always** no-self, as I never wish for it. Therefore to me, suffering is no-self. Hence dukkha *in* anicca, anatta *in* dukkha.

So if someone insists that they have a self, all I have to ask is "do you get bored? Do you suffer?", if they say yes then I ask them "why do you choose to suffer?"

"I am" feeling bored, therefore if I eat a snack, I will feel pleasant, and no longer bored. So this is a level of confidence of control over feelings, and eliminating suffering like boredom.

    Yes, the assumption is most acutely reflected in the attitude towards feelings. Acts of sensuality are the coarsest manifestations of that, but it doesn't end there. Even if you're not specifically doing anything at all, there will still be the tacit assumption that you *could* exert ultimate control over the aggregates if you tried. So that's why sitting down, stopping all activity, and pretending you have no control over your experience doesn't really fix the issue. [You first remove the clearly unwholesome activities](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an3.101), not everything at once.

    The state of affairs is more like the aggregates present you with options, and you can only choose one among those. You can't choose an option that wasn't already available. You can walk because your legs are functional, but you can no longer do so if your legs are amputated. Likewise, you can think and imagine because you have a functional mind that depends on physical factors. So there *is* control, but it's secondary, and secondary control is insufficient to justify a sense of self and ownership.

    >Then again, self cannot mean control because the dhamma is about removing suffering, so we do have control, or is no-self simply control without a label "self", in which case what does "self" mean then?

    Removing suffering doesn't mean removing unpleasant feeling, which would require control. You remove Suffering (Dukkha with capital D) by recognizing the assumption of control as just that—an assumption. And then the aggregates remain as they were, but you no longer Suffer amidst their inherent unpleasantness and unreliability. And that safety is reliable because it doesn't depend on the aggregates doing what you want them to do, as any other safety does, nor does it require you to "slip out" of the aggregates (which is impossible). [Like the deer who learn how not to take the bait even though they still live in the hunting ground.](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn25#mn25:5.25-mn25:6.29)

    >My clearest most rational definition is that I don't choose to suffer, therefore suffering is no-self.

    Yes, but you can't approach it from an impersonal perspective like that. You have to see that if you are suffering, it's because you are unwittingly taking something as self (as in *paṭiccasamuppāda,* if there is sorrow, lamentation, etc., it *has* to be because there is ignorance at the root ). The statement that suffering is not-self only becomes experientially true when you're no longer affected by it, i.e., displeasure is no longer suffering even though it's still there.

### New site for suttas + epubs for Ven. Akincano's and Bhante Anigha's writings

I've been working on a new site to read the read the suttas that I thought I'd share here. It started out just as a place where I could read translations from both Bhikkhu Bodhi and Thanissaro, who were my preferred translators at the time, but since then Bhante Anigha started sharing his excellent translations, so I've them as well. 

I'm also making it a place for resources, so I've compiled all of Venerable Akincano's articles from path press and all of Bhante Anigha's articles from the HH website, and turned them both into ebooks that you can download or read directly on the site with a built in e-reader.

Still a work in progress with a lot more to come, but I figured I'd share it here since others might find the ebooks or suttas useful.

The main site is: [https://abuddhistview.com/](https://abuddhistview.com/)  
and the books can be found at: [https://abuddhistview.com/books](https://abuddhistview.com/books)

Let me know if there's anything specific you'd find helpful. I'll be adding quite a few more books in the near future - audio and ebook

    Nice work. It looks like you're not pulling my translations directly from the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/bkhpanigha/hh-suttas)? I notice some Suttas contain typos and translations of terms that I've edited recently.

    You would also need the HTML file for text structure, and the root file if you want to add Pāli. The available_suttas.json file lists the file paths of all these for each individual Sutta.

### Satipatthana - internal, external, both internal and external.

Friends,

I first read about the Satipatthana Sutta in the seminal work of Ven. Analayo "Satipatthana - The Direct Path to Realization". As for every element of the sutta, Analayo dissects the *interna/external/both* component of the refrain over several pages, and with plenty of references and footnotes. Below is a quick summary:

First, he refers to the Abhidhamma and the commentaries:

>According to the Abhidhamma and the commentarial interpretation, “internal” and “external” satipatthãna encompasses phenomena arising in oneself and in others.

> \[…\]

>in the Satipatthãna Saÿyutta the Buddha introduced these three modes of attention – internal, external, and both – separately as a “threefold way of developing satipatthãna” \[…\] a discourse in the Bojjhaúga Saÿyutta points out that both internal and external sati can act as an awakening factor.

Then into specific Suttas:

>In the Sãmagãma Sutta, for example, the same two terms are used when countering various unwholesome qualities and unskilful forms of behaviour, whether these occur in oneself (ajjhatta) or in others (bahiddhã).

> \[...\] And \[...\]

> in the Janavasabha Sutta, in a context directly related to satipatthãna, “external” explicitly refers to the bodies, feelings, etc. of others. This passage carries considerable weight in relation to the present discussion, since it is the only discourse to provide additional information on the nature of “external” satipatthãna.

After an overview of other, more modern interpretations, he concludes:

>In summary, although alternative ways of understanding internal and external satipatthãna have their practical value, to understand “internal” as referring to oneself and “external” as referring to others offers a practicable form of contemplation which can moreover claim support from the discourses, the Abhidhamma, and the commentaries.

In one of the few posts when this Sutta was discussed in this subreddit (yes, I have read all the posts !!), u/Bhikkhu_Anigha writes the following about the topic ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/176rj53/comment/k4wnyjy/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)):

>\[...\] it's not, as generally interpreted, about contemplating external things like people as opposed to internal ones, which I've seen leads some to think that reflecting on worldly phenomena contributes to enlightenment.

Obviously, I am very keen to find out what Bhikkhu Anigha's interpretation is - unfortunately, he does not elaborate in that post, and I could not find any elsewhere (of course, I might have missed it.)

Also - why the "both internal and external", as expressed multiple times in the refrain? I mean, one can contemplate "internally", or "externally" (whatever their definition), but why add the "both" as a separate method in and all of itself?  As it is often pointed out, the fact that some phrases or words are repeated multiple times in a sutta, it is an indication of the importance the Buddha placed on those instructions, and, as a natural implication, they should be understood.

As always, I am very grateful for any elucidation, May you all be well.

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1e79wsy/satipatthana_internal_external_both_internal_and/le1kiq0/)** _2024-07-20 05:29:54:

    I hadn't considered the passage in DN18. However, it doesn't actually say that one is mindful externally as a *practice*. It says that one gives rise to knowledge and vision of the body, feelings, etc. of others externally as a result of practice.

    The more useful way of interpreting it is that *ajjhattaṃ* means "implicitly", *bahiddhā* means "explicitly". Or, "peripheral" and "actual".

    So, at certain times, you need to be making effort to explicitly think about the body, feelings, etc.; at other times the recollection is "behind" your direct thinking and attention, by itself. This internal aspect becomes most palpable in *samādhi* (and becoming established in virtue is the most basic form of it), and it's why prior to jhānas the Suttas so often state that the mind [becomes established, settled and composed internally](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=sn35.246#sn35.246:3.13-sn35.246:3.14) (this was the central point of my [most recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/theravada/comments/1e2sv0t/on_thinking_about_jhāna_by_ven_thanissaro/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)). It's also how an Arahant is always mindful effortlessly, despite it being as impossible as before to keep their attention fixed on a particular object forever.

    And sometimes, when the recollection is already implicit in your experience whether you think about it or not, you do make further effort to think about it. You are mindful internally and externally. 

    The *ajjhattaṃ* aspect can be regarded as your internal sense bases (six-sensed body) being in themselves mindful regarding whatever arises for them. Everything manifests already within the context. *Bahiddhā* corresponds to how you'd be paying attention to a specific thought or idea, which is always external. But in the right way, of course: you're thinking of the body within the body (or body concurrently with the body), i.e., the body as a context, and not as an ordinary sense object. 

    Also, meditation methods and techniques in this sense remain perpetually "external" (thus always revolving around observation of specific things), but the relief and usefulness of *sammāsamadhi* or temporary liberation is precisely in how the external aspect [no longer requires maintenance](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn19#mn19:12.1-mn19:12.4), thus giving one a glimpse of the way permanent liberation works.

### A Note on Etymology (and Semantics, I guess)

I like to take a few comments in the other thread as an occasion of saying something about the place of etymology, word-derivation, and semantics in understanding the meaning of (Pāli) words. 

There is a growing trend to misapply etymology in order to justify idiosyncratic readings and understandings of Pāli terms and even to construct far reaching doctrinal arguments based on it, which is hazardous. Bhante Anīgha‘s [foreword](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/) to his *sutta* adaptations may serve as an example: 

>On this site, Bhikkhu Sujato’s copyright-free translations have been adapted to create **a work that rigorously aims to convey the meaning of significant Pāli terms drawing solely on their etymology—which is generally unambiguous—**and eschewing commentarial and later baggage that is often present even in most Pāli dictionaries. \[...\] This approach aims to maintain a clear distinction between translation and interpretation, which is often blurred.

Needless to say, this post is not directed in anyway against Bhante or wants to discredit his adaptations, but simply wants to clarify the proper place of etymology when it comes to interpret Pāli words. 

It is sometimes believed, normally only by beginners and amateurs of Pāli, that the etymology of a Pāli word is the direct path to its true and original meaning. This is a misconception. Originally, granted, that is what [etymology](https://www.etymonline.com/word/etymology) wanted to be, resting on a general human belief that what is older and original must by that also be more true and genuine, and that what comes later tends to be degenerate and false. This is why  arguments referring to etymology appear superficially impressive and convincing to non-experts. 

However, referring to etymology in order to provide the 'true meaning' of a word is a fallacy arising mainly from not knowing what etymology actually is and does today, how it is done properly, and what its necessary limitations are. The misconception also arises from not understanding correctly how meaning in general is constructed within languages. Etymology also more often than not doesn't tell us much about the synchronic meaning and usage of a word. Take the etymology of the word '[understand](https://www.etymonline.com/search?q=understand)' in English, for example. Or, to take a Pāli example, how much does the root of the Pāli word *dhamma* (S. *dharman*)*, dhṛ* 'hold', tell us about the manifold senses, shades, nuances and usages of that term?

Today, etymology is the study of the origin and evolution of a word's semantic meaning across history. It comprises fields such as word formation, diachronic development of form, and diachronic and synchronic meaning, i.e. how word meaning changes over time and what a word means at a specific time or time period. It is thus mainly about how the sense of a word changes over time. Etymology is historical and because of that more often than not speculative and tentative and necessarily ever more limited the further we go back in history, simply due to the limitations of textual sources. It does have a place in learning what a word means, yes, but that place is only advisory and never decisive. 

What determines the meaning of a word at a certain point in time, i.e. its synchronic meaning, is that word's position in a context, its usage, and that context is always interpreted by the translator. That context is hierarchically structured according to phrase, sentence, passage, text, textual corpus and eventually the whole socio-cultural historical environment in which that textual corpus was produced and stood. When it comes to an ancient language, even one as well attested to as Pāli, we run into obvious necessary limitations in reconstructing that context. 

Taking that into account shows the absurdity of [apodictic](https://www.etymonline.com/search?q=apodictic) pronouncements about the meaning of Pāli words solely based on their etymology. The line between translation and interpretation cannot be blurred, because it doesn't exist. Every translation of a text is an interpretation and hence there cannot be "one right translation". 

Bhante writes: 

>Terms and expressions of doctrinal and practical significance found in the early Suttas are sometimes misrepresented in existing translations. 

Yes, indeed. Only the attempt to rely solely on etymology in order to rectify this state of affairs is unsound and far to simplistic. 

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1e71ewd/a_note_on_etymology_and_semantics_i_guess/ldx6y1m/)** _2024-07-19 12:46:18:

    There certainly is room for different renderings of many Pāli words. I wouldn't take great issue with someone rendering the word *dosa* as either aversion, resistance, or ill will. Translating *saṅkhāra* as fabrication, volitional formation, activity, concoction, etc., or *pīti* as rapture, joy, gladness, bliss, etc., could all be reasonably justified, even though some of them may not fit my personal preference.

    Etymology certainly does not give us one and only one option in most cases, and I often find myself making changes. Moments ago I replaced "spiritual colleague" with "fellow renunciate" for *sabrahmacāri*. I also still haven't found a satisfactory rendering for very elementary terms like *kusala*, and have changed my mind several times.

    What etymology gives us is a rough fence that the translation of a word should not end up outside of. I am not claiming to have found the one and only right spot within the fence, and I don't think there *can* be such a thing simply because English and Pāli are two completely different languages, and I am certainly biasing certain options within the fence based on what I think is best.

    But what I do claim is that things like ["love" for *adosa*](https://suttacentral.net/mn9/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=main&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin#7.1) lie way outside the fence to be acceptable. Translating *teneva pītipāmojjena vihātabbaṃ ahorattānusikkhinā kusalesu dhammesu* as “Then they should *meditate* with rapture and joy, training day and night in skillful qualities” gives a significantly different impression than “Then they should dwell/live/abide...” which all do fall within the range of *viharati*. Just to give some examples.

    I haven't yet found a collection of translations by a single author where such stark deviations do not occur at least sometimes, and that gap is what I hope to fill. I also wouldn't be opposed to changing any of my chosen English renderings if someone were to prove to me that it does not fit either the Pāli word itself well, or its usage in other Suttas I may not have considered.

    I am also well aware that in many cases, a Pāli passage alone does not enforce a particular interpretation, but taking not only etymology but also many different Suttas on the same topic into account certainly shaves off a whole lot of potential misinterpretations that the vast majority of modern teachings heavily rely on. Once those are off the table, it's up to the individual to judge the positive assertions I make about what the right interpretation is, but the space is a lot more narrow than is generally thought if we take as many Suttas into account as possible, and make sure not to casually assume that the Buddha said things he didn't mean, or meant things he didn't ever say.

    >This approach aims to maintain a clear distinction between translation and interpretation, which is often blurred.

    I can acknowledge that this is poorly worded, and sounds as if I'm claiming that I am not interpreting the texts *at all*.

    (Edit: It's also possible that I've been using the term "etymology" wrong, in which case I'm happy to be corrected. What I consider when translating is a word's root, what that root is said to mean in an compendium of roots such as [this](https://discourse.suttacentral.net/t/pali-roots-from-the-saddaniti/2471), what Pāli and Sanskrit dictionaries as well as other translators say, and last but certainly not least, the various occurrences of the word/phrase in different contexts across the Vinaya and Nikāyas, which in rare cases does not immediately follow from its derivation, e.g. *nirodha* .This alone leaves me with a list of possible renderings that are very semantically close almost every time, from which I then pick what I think fits best, though I may change my mind to one of the other options later on.)

    >With "dead" or historic languages we obviously can't rely on that and apart from context and usage we can only take into account retrospective reconstruction.

    I agree, and with the other points too.

    Although, again, I would argue that, not always but in many important cases, translators overstep the boundaries of what even that ultimately approximate retrospective reconstruction allows for, and there often doesn't seem to be any objective argument behind it, but more just a tacit assumption that the Suttas should fit the conceptual framework they personally approach the Dhamma with, and not the other way around. To quote Ven. Ñāṇavīra's maxim, which I've always adhered to both for personal practice and translation work:

    >It was, and is, my attitude towards the Suttas that, if I find anything in them that is against my own view, ***they are right, and I am wrong***\*.\* I have no reason to regret having adopted this attitude.

    Or, as MN 70 puts it:

    >'Monks, a faithful disciple, who proceeds having plunged into the Teacher's advice, does so in accordance with this: "The Blessed One is the teacher, I am the disciple. The Blessed One knows. I do not know."' 

    Not having this attitude automatically means the translator will unwittingly allow themselves to interpret the text way beyond the theoretical minimum in order to accommodate their personal interpretation, subconsciously overlooking or diminishing the importance of passages that contradict it. Even if they can find a justification for it after the fact, through linguistics, the commentaries, or what it seems to them that other Suttas are saying, still they aren't treating the text with due respect from the outset, and this inevitably affects the final result. Since this is the case most of the time, I doubt we even have a "vanilla" set of English translations that is, or at least attempts to be, uncompromisingly faithful to the retrospective knowledge of Pāli that we do have, putting aside whether that knowledge is entirely correct or not. Bhikkhu Bodhi's come close, but they're not freely accessible, and he does tend to resort to the commentarial gloss sometimes even though the Sutta perfectly speaks for itself.

    On the other hand, having that mindset makes translation work a lot more personal and demanding of courage and self-honesty. But making it personal in that way is, if done properly, the closest one can get to taking oneself out of the picture, ironically (that doesn't mean scholars will have any interest in the final product of course). It's just that it's not pleasant at all to perpetually acknowledge that there is nothing you can take for granted about your understanding, and to be ready to *completely* revise your views from the bottom up at a moment's notice, no matter how much sense they made before. But it's the only way to gain supramundane benefit from the Suttas and, I dare say, to gain even a mostly accurate mundane overview of their message. This faith and radical humility is indispensable for the utterance of another to be able to cut through the mass of ignorance and wrong views that impedes not only attainments, but also an accurate intellectual grasp of the Suttas.

    I should perhaps also clarify that when I make "apodictic" statements about what the Suttas are actually saying, those are not meant to have any scholarly or objective value. Those are directed at people who are already at least somewhat receptive to the points I make and are willing to look at their own experience in that light. They're not meant to persuade academics who keep the Dhamma at arms length, practitioners who are already fully convinced that their chosen interpretation or tradition aligns with the early texts, or people who don't care much about that in the first place, and more about feeling calm and peaceful in the short term by whichever means or combination of means happen to work for them (which is fine as long as they're honest with themselves).

### Kusala Citta vs. Sukha Vedana

As Ajahn often instructs, the overaching mood that one is under the influence of, is a close approximation to what the citta is at the time. In what way does one then distinguish a 'gladdened mind' or an 'elated mind' ; from a pleasant feeling.

Since both *Citta* as well as *Vedana* are peripheral, and structurally precede dhammas, is it possible to tell them apart, and/or is it even necessary; since the *working principle* of the practice is to restrain from acting on the basis of *either one* (regardless of being able to tell them apart).

Thank you.

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1e6434y/kusala_citta_vs_sukha_vedana/ldw3bfi/)** _2024-07-19 06:19:08:

    The most important difference would be that you can have a pleasant feeling accompanied by an unwholesome *citta*, since there can be a context or mood of valuing sensuality accompanying that feeling. Similarly, there can be unpleasant feeling with a wholesome *citta* that values renunciation (the pain of renunciation, as it's called in some Suttas).

    So, basically, *citta* would be along the lines of what you are valuing and inclining towards, aside from the way you currently happen to feel.

### Asking for help

Hello everyone,

I'm in my mid 20s with a stable job and low income. I'm considering advancing my career. The existential pressure I am currently feeling is hard to handle as I also maintain a consideration that I could just up and leave to go to a monastery. My attachments are preventing me from doing so currently. I take the 5 precepts and want to be celibate, but struggle to commit to the decision. I feel overwhelmed due to my mind going back and forth on and on in trying to make a decision about developing my career by undertaking further studying (as I'm unable to commit to renunciation fully) or just to make further effort to go to a monastery.

Leaving to go to a monastery could just be a cop out for putting effort to ensure I can look after myself in the world and fend for myself (I currently live with my mum and step dad.)

I have this constant background noise regarding decision this every day and have had it for a while. Does anyone have any advice?

    >Leaving to go to a monastery could just be a cop out for putting effort to ensure I can look after myself in the world and fend for myself (I currently live with my mum and step dad.)

    It could, but that doesn't mean staying at home and continuing to pursue a career is better automatically. You could improve the context that you're approaching monastery life with, and realize that it's actually going to be harder than anything you might try in lay life, but infinitely more fruitful if you use it wisely. Then it will no longer present itself as a cop out, and if you truly value freedom from suffering, you would see it as the ideal choice.

    And then even if you stay at home, you would be tailoring your life to fit those values as much as possible, instead of thinking you're justified in maintaining conditions that are not conducive to taming the mind because you won't ordain after all.

    It's not a necessity per se. It's possible that you'd be able to keep the precepts in the more tailored environment of the monastery better than at home. Even though that would indicate a less than ideal degree of self-sufficiency and determination initially, it doesn't inherently block you from developing your mind to the same extent in the end.

### On Withstanding the Defilements

Hello everyone,

I've been engaging with the teachings of Ajahn Nyanamoli and HH on and off for the past years, finding them sometimes more, sometimes less convincing and useful.

The recent upload on YouTube, "Withstanding the Defilements" got me interested in writing this post.

I take a summary of the talk that was approved by the channel in the comments as a starting point:

>"Phenomena arise on their own. You can not stop that. If annoyance arises within me, the unpleasant feeling of annoyance itself is not the problem. The problem is if I start dwelling on that arisen feeling. If I start getting worked up about it. The problem is if I lash out at someone next to me due to my aversion to that arisen annoyance." - ToKiniAndy

Phenomena here includes the defilements, "some form of greed, hatred and delusion", as mentioned in the quote of a question to Ajahn Chah at the beginning. So, the way to properly deal with arisen defilements of greed, hatred and delusion (or however one wants to render *rāga*, *dosa*, *moha*) is to fortify the mind through virtue and sense restraint and not act out of or based on those arisen defilements in any way, simply letting them endure as the arisen phenomena they always already were. This is safety, this is the "island that no flood can overwhelm". If you don't go towards the waves, you don't wet yourself.

However, it seems that the teaching of "enduring arisen defilements" is contradicted by several passages in the suttas. Take, e.g., the following section of MN 2 on "detriments to be gotten rid of through dispelling" (*āsavā vinodanā pahātabbā*):

>... Here, monks, reflecting properly, a monk **does not endure (*****nādhivāseti*****)** an arisen thought of sensuality, **he gets rid of it, dispells it, makes an end to it (*****byantīkaroti*****), eradicates it (*****anabhāvaṃ gameti*****, lit. causes it do go to non-existence).** A monk **does not endure (*****nādhivāseti*****)** an arisen thought of ill-will ... an arisen thought of cruelty ... variously arisen bad, unwholesome things, **he gets rid of them, dispells them, makes an end to them (*****byantīkaroti*****), eradicates them (*****anabhāvaṃ gameti*****, lit. causes it do go to non-existence).**

"Detriments to be gotten rid of through enduring", *āsavā adhivāsanā pahātabbā*, are mentioned earlier on. Defilements are not listed here, but various painful bodily experiences.

Consider also the following (SN 38.3):

>Those for whom, friend, greed ... hatred ... delusion ... is gotten rid of, with it's root cut, made like the site of a (previous) palm tree, **made non-existent (*****anabhāvaṅ*****-*****kato*****), not liable to arise (again) in the future (*****āyatiṃ anuppādadhammo),*** they are blessed (*sugatā*) in the world.

This is about the arahant. If the Buddha had meant that defilements are to be endured or withstood infinitely without acting out of them, he could have simply said so. Terms like *adhivāsanā*, *adhivāseti*, *khanti*, *khamo*, *khamati* are definetly used in the texts in senses of '(patiently) enduring, (fore-)bearing etc.', but they seem not to be employed positively when it comes to defilements. After all, *dukkhanirodha*, the third noble truth, is called the "**remainderless fading away and cessation** of craving" (*taṇhāya asesa-virāga-nirodho,* cp. SN 56.11), not simply the non-acting out of it.

What are your thoughts on this? If I should have misrepresented Ajahn Nyanamoli's teachings here, I would be glad to be corrected.

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1e5i0zr/on_withstanding_the_defilements/ldq668j/)** _2024-07-18 04:51:21:

    The confusion stems from conflating unwholesome thoughts (*vitakka*) and the perceptions and feelings that accompany them. Saying that you should "endure" the former would be like saying you should endure breaking the precepts, which is silly. But trying to "obliterate" the latter is also silly, because they're not in your control to begin with, and by trying to get rid of them you'll be acting out of craving there and then. It's like smashing all bottles of alcohol you encounter so as to not break the fifth precept.

    Instead, you "starve" the craving by enduring the perceptions and feelings, and enduring them means you won't be doing unwholesome actions by body. speech, or thought.

    >"**remainderless fading away and cessation** of craving

    And that's what leads to this, whereas if you're only concerned with suppressing and avoiding the entire picture and not just the part you're responsible for (the intentional thoughts), you're not addressing craving at its root, but merely concealing the triggers for it.

    And the Suttas do speak about "enduring" in this way. See SN 35.228, SN 35.247, MN 4, Thag 1.21, Thag 2.36, and the first line of the Ovāda Pātimokkha for a few examples.

    >doesn’t this directly implicate the use of a technique like loving kindness mindfulness to remove thoughts of aversion?

    Quite the opposite. You remove thoughts of aversion in the same way you drop something with your hand, because they are *choices*. A thought of aversion is a choice to *do* something on the mental level in response to displeasure that arose. The displeasure is not unwholesome in itself, which is why we clearly see the Buddha being displeased with certain people on many occasions. Loving kindness techniques operate through the view that displeasure itself is the problem, and so they're not actually training the mind so that it can have *limitless* mettā, i.e. that friendliness remains no matter how unpleasantly a certain person or experience is felt. They help you not react by removing the challenging stimulus altogether.

    >When you speak of "intentional thoughts", do you mean something different from the thoughts Ajahn is speaking about above?

    No, we're saying the same thing in different words. You can clearly see the unwholesome thoughts he's referring to are things that arise on their own and you're not responsible for. That's what I'm referring to when mentioning perceptions and feelings that exert pressure over you on their own, and that when *vitakka* (i.e., intentional giving in to those) is there, you should immediately "obliterate" it. This is what he refers to when he writes "you're responsible for your acceptance of them, for delighting and acting out of them". So if you use his description, when you read the Buddha talking about obliterating unwholesome thoughts in the Suttas, it would be "obliterate your acceptance of/delight in them".

    >The thing is, if we are responsible for the arising of unwholesome thoughts (which you say, Bhante, although Ajahn Nyanamoli seems to say the opposite) - i.e., if they arise simultaneously with unpleasant feelings and perceptions - ending the thought effectively ends the accompanying pressuring feeling as well.

    No. If it feels like that, you're probably overshooting the mark in your definition of what a "thought" is,  and are suppressing the entire perception and experience instead of just your defiled volition (your "acceptance of the thought" in AN's way of describing it).

    >In this regard, let's also consider the following *sutta* (SN 35.96):

    The term *saṅkappa* makes it quite clear that it's talking about an intentional engagement. AN 6.63 talks about how sensuality is not the agreeable objects of the five senses, but one's passionate intention (*saṅkapparāga*) in relation to them. So you can have objects that *would* arouse sensual intentions present in your experience, still being felt pleasantly as before, but without a passionate intention. And this is exactly how the Buddha[ describes the first jhāna.](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an9.42#an9.42:3.2-an9.42:4.5)

    The way I'm describing it is meant to be more strictly in line with the Suttas, but it might be causing more confusion, so just stick to Ajahn Nyanamoli's description. Think of it like not accepting a gift that someone presents to you. You don't need to destroy the gift, you just need to not accept it even if it's left there for years. And nothing bad or unwholesome can possibly take place for as long as your hands stay off the gift.

    [This talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igC9gzKZV6o) might also be helpful.

    >They are about restraint. However, these are not references to *enduring unwholesome thoughts or withstanding defilements.* The *dhammā* spoken of here are on the same level as agreeable/disagreeable sights, sounds etc., and are not a problem in themselves.

    Correct. Ajahn Nyanamoli uses phrases like "withstanding defilements" precisely because people generally have a wrong understanding of what *dhammas* are, for example. Saying it that way pushes people to consider that part of what they regard as an unwholesome thought is actually part of the *dhamma* itself, such as the pressure it exerts. Hence the Buddha's comparison with withstanding a tide.

    The downside is that for some who have a tendency to get caught up in semantics, it sounds to them like they should "endure" things that they're fully responsible for, and that's not what is meant.

    I mentioned SN 35.247 because it describes tying down the six sense bases *while they continue to pull*. It doesn't say that you stop them from pulling.

    >Regarding Thg 1.21, that one simply reads:  

    I read "nāhaṃ bhayassa bhāyāmi" as "I am not afraid of fear", which fits better with the third line. Point being, you are truly beyond fear when you can withstand the tide and pressure of fear that comes on its own, not when you suppress it or manage it.

    >Here patience seems indeed to mean bearing and not acting out of ones angry thoughts when it comes to living with others.

    Sure, you can take it that way, but still the principle is the same. You can't prevent yourself from being displeased by what others do, and the Buddha himself clearly was on many occasions. But if you think destroying unwholesome thoughts means not feeling that displeasure anymore, your peaceful mind will be depending on something that's actually not in your control, i.e. your own feelings. If instead you see that the unwholesomeness is in your action, even mental, in relation to what you feel, then you can develop true imperturbability. That's what's described by the simile of the mountain in AN 6.55, where even mental phenomena can be forceful and intense, but the mind of an Arahant does not tremble in face of even that which is so close and "internal".

    >So, phrasings like "withstanding defilements" or "enduring unwholesome thoughts" are rather meant didactically

    Yes, and in fact the are cases where the Suttas themselves border on that. There's the example of AN 3.121, which is actually more explicit than all the other ones I mentioned above, where purity of mind (*mano*) is defined as knowing that the hindrances are present while they are present, and this is synonymous with withstanding them. This is analogous to the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta*'s* instruction of knowing passionate mind as passionate mind, etc.

    The right type of "knowing" (*yoniso manasikāra)* in itself closes off the possibility of tolerating unwholesome things, since that can only happen when you lose perspective and become tunnel-visioned, as it were.

    >Understanding the practice as intentionally not welcoming thoughts that we understood as dangerous, makes it more clear why Buddha spoke in terms of "manly effort", "heedfulness", "striving", and "achieving the unachieved."

    Indeed. If it were about the arising of thoughts in itself, you could break free from sensuality accidentally or circumstantially. In the same way, you could get trapped by it again accidentally even though you were perfectly diligent in your practice.

### My circumstances, and ordination. Gratefully asking for advice.

I am a psychology graduate living in the UK. Have gone through abuse most of my life and only gotten my freedom 2.5 years ago. Originally wanted to go into a career of mental health. Had an on-off secular meditation practice of 7 years. Used to be nostril-watcher but changed as I had to cultivate better behaviours to overcome trauma.

I stumbled upon HH a year ago by accident. I was starting to get into buddhism due to an ego death experience on mushrooms and curiosity into the concept of nibbana and the spiritual life. I was planning to join the army as an unconventional route into the mental health field (developing leadership skills, tolerating high amounts of stress, cultivating and teaching emotional intelligence to soldiers etc.).

As I started watching HH videos, I started to gain knowledge in buddhism and was considering becoming a monk after 5 years into the army. Then I watched more videos and recognised that pursuing the spiritual path is the most important thing I can do in my life. My background, purpose, everything, this is exactly what I want and need to do.

I contacted my therapist who helped me overcome lots of my trauma and told her about my decision. What then started was a strange but unique arrangement, I started talking to her again, paying for her time to start watching HH videos so I could practise my learning by teaching her the concepts and finding holes in my knowledge whereby she would ask questions I couldn't answer. Over time she started to understand buddhism more and its implications, understands my urge to ordain and the sheer weighted difference between the dhamma and psychotherapy. I have tried to talk about the dhamma to friends but even the slightest claim that circumstances might not be the cause of suffering has severely upset them, so I have nobody else to talk to who is not psychologically minded besides my trusted therapist, who, thankfully is starting to understand the 'context' of suffering vs the content. She is providing me with that middle ground - not an uninstructed person with no knowledge of the mind where I have to start from scratch, but western-orientated enough to push me to properly understand the concepts enough to teach. I have yet to find any other mental health professional who grasps not-self mundanely. She comments that despite being a beginner in learning she gets that the stuff we discuss are things most people could not comprehend, whether monk or layperson, and would be terrified to explore.

My learning arrangement might be strange but it works for now as I try to organise myself.

I plan to ordain, roughly in the first few months of next year. I've read previous posts but I'm still lost...

The advantages of my situation is that upon telling my family they were incredibly supportive. I am indeed half thai so my mother is already obsessed with turning my ordination into an extravaganza purely for thai culture. I have lots of money in savings so can afford to quit my job at the start of next year for more seclusion in my laylife, and need not worry about emergency funds.

Problem is, with my mother being so toxic and me being a survivor of filial piety, I feel like her support is going to be simultaneously a major help and obstruction. She already wants to sort out my visa, but I'm worried she will try to push me to go to a crap monastery.

I understand that picking out monasteries in general is picking the least worse out of the bunch, and my post is asking about whether my heritage will help me or whether I should consider Sri Lanka. I'm wondering whether I should quit my job early so I can have enough free time to obtain the right view. I'm wondering whether if I go to a thai monastery where they confiscate my phone, would I be allowed to bring physical books and even printed papers of HH video transcripts (if I'm that desperate)? Do the bad monasteries allow you to study any material or do you literally just chant and polish floors?

My brother thinks I should ordain in a UK monastery as he knows how awful thai ones can be. Was wondering if anyone has experience with english monasteries or heard of what they are like?

Some people have recommended a partially renounced lay lifestyle before considering ordination but I'm not sure why that it is and would appreciate everyone's perspective on this.

Thank you for reading, sorry for the long post, I appreciate any comments or pointers in the right direction.

    >My brother thinks I should ordain in a UK monastery as he knows how awful thai ones can be.

    That may not work. Apparently, you can get in trouble at English Ajahn Chah monasteries to the point of being denied ordination simply due to expressing interest in HH, even if you're polite and well-behaved.

    The sheer amount of monasteries in Thailand means that at least a few should be good enough, even if most of them are inadequate for various reasons. All you really need is a place where the Vinaya is kept, you have some free time in seclusion and are not overburdened with duties and activities, and you won't get punished just for having a different view than the seniors as long as you're otherwise a good monk. It's not a dealbreaker if you lose internet access for as long as you don't get in trouble for using the "wrong" Dhamma resources.

    >I want to show gratitude, but I don't want to create a tense situation out of having to say thank you.

    You can just do that without explicitly mentioning HH, which, depending on who exactly it is, might make them just become cold and avoidant for no good reason. If you really want to, you could just mention that you've begun to take the Suttas more seriously, since that's literally all there is to it.

    >Even the smallest of structures has to be intolerant to some extent.

    Sure, but there are levels to it. Guests with different views who visit Samaṇadīpa are still treated amicably like everybody else. If there are disagreements, they're discussed without reserve, and it's not made personal or spiteful, even though there is certainly no sugarcoating. But if you mention liking HH in one of these monasteries, you'll probably start receiving cold shoulders (at least from what I've heard; I haven't been there).

    >And once you are in, it seems much harder to stay open to radically different approaches to thing.

    Yes, unfortunately it seems to be quite cult-like. From what I've been told by various sources, you can get asked to disrobe, or to forget about returning, if you ever want to move to a place that's not officially part of the tradition. And even if you get permission, you might get asked to return from time to time to provide "proof" of your loyalty.

    And yes, I'm sure a good portion of the monks there are great people. But I imagine most of them eventually end up believing the outright false rumors they hear about the things Ajahn Nyanamoli and others who've "deserted" supposedly did while they were there (I heard some myself back in Sri Lanka), and so become biased against his teachings on an unfounded basis. Because, sure, no matter how reasonable someone's arguments sound, you'd be right to be skeptical of their teachings if they also were known to act in unwholesome ways,

    I suppose there might also be a track record of obnoxious HH "followers" and "Ñāṇavīrists" who visit these places and *do* go around displaying arrogance, spite, and foolish recalcitrance.

    >a life in a Western Ajahn Chah monastery is still a much superior choice to any regular lay life

    I'd say it largely depends on which monastery. Even putting aside the whole subject of views, at some of them you may find yourself spending more time in company than as a layperson but now having genuinely no say in it, owing to meaningless but mandatory activities. And not that much more withdrawn from sensuality, the opposite sex, and worldly affairs, either.

    Not sure if it's "widely known", but it definitely would be in UK monasteries because Ajahn Nyanamoli ordained there.

### Path Press recommended reading

I'm interested in reading the writings of Ajahn Nyanamoli Thero, but I've heard 'Meanings,' in particular, can be quite challenging. Is this true? If so, are there any other books on the Path Press Publications website that can help me understand 'Meanings' or any of his other books better?

I already have some context from the YouTube videos, I just wanted something in book format.

Thanks in advance for any recommendations! I really appreciate the help.

    You'll be much closer to understanding Meanings the way it's supposed to be understood—as descriptions of the way out of suffering that are directly applicable to your own experience—if you've been earnestly putting into practice what is said in Dhamma Within Reach, The Only Way to Jhāna, the Dhamma talks, and of course the Suttas. Limited intelligence is not the real obstacle. 

    The more rigorous style of Clearing the Path by Ven. Ñāṇavīra can help point out how various fashionable doctrines and notions are actually not canonical, so it can be useful for those with prior experience with Buddhist teachings and somewhat of an intellectual bent. For those who are totally new, it's probably not strictly essential.

    I also had gotten interested in his writings early on since he's renowed as a Sutta expert, but was disappointed to find that he's basically just reading the Mahayānist (and Commentarial Theravādin) views—of "Ultimate Non-Conceptual Reality" hidden behind the illusory conventional reality, and that language and concepts induce ignorance—into the Suttas in often roundabout and long-winded ways. He also taught Mahāsi-style noting meditation and "bare awareness" as the means to see through the supposed illusion.

    Perhaps it can be useful if you take it as a brief exercise in pinpointing where the fallacies in his views lie, and why they're not what the Buddha taught (SN 22.94).

### Some assistance with understanding the “extent” of defilements?

It is my understanding that defilements are maintained by ignorance, so understanding them – their “extent” or entire domain – results in their abandonment right there and then. We cannot understand something and be ignorant of it at the same time. The mind infected with greed is actively maintaining its infection through ignorance of that activity. Seeing the sign of the mind infected with greed means recognizing that greediness is a detrimental overlay, something inflicted on experience by the assumed ownership of the untamed citta’s inclination toward a sense object. The Right View includes the recognition of how defilements cannot defile the mind without the false belief that they can. Until the full extent of defilements is recognized, any recognition of a defilement will disguise the defilement that underlies that recognition as its background and context. For example, even our attempt to peripherally apprehend the mind of greed may be done with aversion because we cannot discern what is simultaneously present. 

Am I misunderstanding anything? Because it isn’t clear to me why a sotapanna cannot be defiled by the defilements. Does that mean that the way they relate to their underlying tendencies is fundamentally different from how a worldling regards the defilements? Or is there such a thing as lapses in the Right View based on those tendencies? 

Thanks in advance to anyone who takes the time to reply.

    >Until the full extent of defilements is recognized, any recognition of a defilement will disguise the defilement that underlies that recognition as its background and context. For example, even our attempt to peripherally apprehend the mind of greed may be done with aversion because we cannot discern what is simultaneously present.

    It’s true that initially one cannot see the full extent of defilements, but it’s not like you then get to see it by trying extra hard to do so. You simply train according to what you can presently recognize; the Gradual Training is the refinement of restraining defilements, and that's why it follows a certain order. Diligence in not yielding to the unwholesome tendencies that are now discernible (which initially would be the obvious breaking of the precepts) *on its own* broadens the mind so that less blatant aspects are gradually uncovered. You can’t manually "dig up" the defilements, but what you can do is renounce the acts that covered them up.

    >Does that mean that the way they relate to their underlying tendencies is fundamentally different from how a worldling regards the defilements?

    Yes. It means that they *will* become aware of the underlying tendencies if they try. They will not overlook them if they don’t want to. On the other hand, a *puthujjana* has a high likelihood of unwittingly covering up their own greed, aversion, and delusion through secondary alibis such as their views, tradition, textual authority, devotion to a method or a teacher, sense of duty, etc. (even if they’re theoretically well-founded) because they lack self-honesty and don’t sufficiently see their own mind, nor the fact that that’s where all wholesome or unwholesome takes place and the rest is secondary. A *puthujjana* will tend to put their views and preferred observances/practices first and the need to see the present defilements second, tacitly assuming that these will somehow take care of their defilements by themselves (a salient characteristic of meditation techniques). In contrast, for a *sotāpanna* the priority has been flipped: the Right View is precisely *about* prioritizing the craving that is concretely seen at any given time, and no external crutches, psychologizing, or uncertainty of any kind are involved, which is why their practice would remain even after their memory is completely wiped in a new life.

    >Or is there such a thing as lapses in the Right View based on those tendencies?

    The diligence informed by the Right View can lapse, but not the Right View itself. And again, there is a difference in that if and when the sotāpanna is diligent, even if it’s only once in a blue moon, they are unquestionably moving in the right direction, whereas a puthujjana can be diligent 24/7 in a way that creates more harm than good because of their wrong view. Hence, “sotāpanna”[ literally means](https://suttacentral.net/sn55.5/en/sujato?lang=en) one who has entered the stream (the Noble Eightfold Path) that now "carries" them to Nibbāna.

    > Is that a fair way to describe their situation?

    In essence, yes. Intentional or careless lapsing is rooted in the same for puthujjana and sotāpanna: not wanting to go against the grain. But for a sotāpanna the lapsing has of course much less dire consequences.

    A puthujjana has an additional type of lapsing that sotāpanna hasn't, which is falling back into wrong views and expectations that they had temporarily overcome, and the likelihood of that occurring shoots up each time they act unwholesomely. Defilements nourish ignorance, and ignorance nourishes defilements.

### On “Thinking about Jhāna” by Ven. Thanissaro

I discovered [this recent writing](https://www.dhammatalks.org/books/HeartFlowing/06-thinking-about-jhana.html) by Ven. Ṭhānissaro that attempts to disprove some of the points I made in my essay about the jhānas (not sure if deliberately), and so I decided to address the main remarks made there because it serves as an opportunity to better articulate and expand upon the essence of what I originally wrote. It’s not necessary to be familiar with the original essay to comprehend the following.

>The longstanding habit of translating jhāna as “absorption” has been called into question, largely because the verb jhāyati is often translated in a more generic way as “meditate.” From this, it’s been argued that, because the verb has a generic meaning, the noun should, too.

>But even if we ignore the argument’s weak logic, we can note that its starting point—the persistent habit of translating jhāyati as “meditate”—is itself questionable. There’s nothing in the suttas to indicate that jhāyati, used in a positive sense in the context of meditation, means anything other than specifically, “do jhāna.”

A number of instances indicate that it does have a generic meaning. In the account of [MN 36](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn36#mn36:21.2) of the bodhisatta's period of austerities, it's said that he thought to himself at one point: *“yannūnāhaṃ appāṇakaṃ jhānaṃ jhāyeyyaṃ”*. This expression uses both the noun *jhāna* and the verb *jhāyati* in a context that most certainly does not refer to the standard four jhānas, since at that time he had not yet acknowledged those states as the way to enlightenment. “Appāṇaka jhāna” cannot refer to the fourth jhāna, also evidenced by how he had clearly not reached the genuine cessation of breathing, but was rather holding his breath as a form of austerity. Similarly, in DN 19, the brahmin Mahāgovinda thinks: *“yannūnāhaṃ karuṇaṃ jhānaṃ jhāyeyyaṃ”*, and we know from the Suttas that even though the four brahmavihāras are a form of *samādhi* that can fulfill the same purpose as the four jhānas, they’re not the same.

In AN 11.9, *jhāyati* is used in a generic sense throughout, and there it certainly does not refer to the jhānas only, since the formless dimensions are mentioned (which are not jhānas; they’re misclassified as such by the Commentaries, not the Suttas). Similarly, MN 108 states that the Buddha “did not praise all *jhāna*”, which there is no reason to interpret as meaning that he does not approve of some “types” of the four jhānas (a concept that, as we shall see, is unfounded). It means he does not approve of all types of meditation, for the lack of a better word.

>Second, even though the suttas do devote a lot of space to the practice of using thought to abandon unskillful qualities and to develop skillful qualities, that doesn’t mean that such a practice should be called jhāna. The actual fact of the matter, as we will see, is that the suttas describe this practice as a step prior to jhāna (DN 2; AN 10:99), and not as jhāna itself.

There is some truth to this. We see in MN 19 that the Buddha had to go a step further than mere wholesome thinking in order to enter the first jhāna, and we see the exact same situation implied in [AN 3.121](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an3.121). There is a point where only wholesome thoughts are left, but the mind is not yet fully appeased. However, “composing the mind internally” does not mean becoming absorbed or immersed, but the complete opposite. Demonstrating this is the main purpose of this writing.

>Fourth, and most graphically, the fact that doing jhāna would involve, not thinking, but actual absorption in physical and mental sensations, is shown in the similes we’ve quoted above: The meditator is said to pervade the body with feelings of pleasure to the point where, in the third jhāna, nothing in the body is unpervaded, and then moving on to a state in which the body is filled with a pure bright awareness. It’s hard to interpret this simply as a process of thinking, and not to see it as a state of full-body absorption in bodily and mental sensations.

Pervading the body with the pleasure of jhāna is indeed not a matter of ordinary thinking, but it’s a stretch to assume that it therefore must be the result of immersion in physical sensations. It’s neither.

Firstly, any sensation at all (which should not be confused with feeling or *vedanā*), no matter how internal it is, has to fall within the external sense field of tactile phenomena (i.e., the fifth string of sensuality). This is evidenced by how the Buddha chose to describe the 6 internal sense bases as “void, empty, and hollow”, comparing them to an empty village that gets attacked by bandits (the six external sense bases). If the 5th internal sense base could be outlined by certain sensations, it would have a specific substance defining it, and thus it wouldn’t be “void”.

The designation “whole body” in the jhāna similes of the bathman, etc., should not be interpreted as primarily spatial, in which case the instruction to pervade the whole body will be misunderstood as some sort of body scan exercise, as it often is. The body is a phenomenological totality that can only be approached as a unity, so even if one suffuses every single pore and internal point where sensations of touch are felt with pleasant energies, that’s still not the whole body. The sum of its parts does not equal the whole. That totality is also what one becomes increasingly separated from in the jhāna progression, which is why one gets to relate to it more and more equanimously, culminating in the fourth jhāna where the mind has separated itself from the most foundational aspect of the body, which is breathing. The totality of the body is not in itself spatial; [it is that because of which the world, including space, is there to begin with](https://suttacentral.net/sn2.26/en/sujato).

Now, in the case of the first jhāna which is the most pivotal, we need only look at the [standard description](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=dn2#dn2:69.1-dn2:74.4) of the practice that precedes it to see what *pītisukha* is supposed to result from: the relief of no longer being liable to the mental burden of the five hindrances. The mind disentangles and becomes separated from the pull of unwholesome states once they’ve been sufficiently seen as troublesome and unwanted, and it’s even said that the joy arises when one *considers* their absence—a mental, reflective affair—and not that the pleasure arises at the bodily level first. And, as the same description says further on, which occurs over fifty times in the Nikāyas, it’s when the mind is already joyous that the body calms down. Not the other way around.

One who has not clearly seen with right understanding the unsatisfactoriness and peril of sensuality is said to be incapable of entering the first jhāna (AN 6.73), as this is the tool for giving rise to *pītisukha*. If the origin of *pītisukha* were bodily, we would expect the Buddha to say that one can’t attain the first jhāna if one doesn’t know how to work with bodily sensations, and there is nothing in the texts to indicate this. Pervading the body with rapture and pleasure comes *after* the attainment of jhāna, not before.

We should also note that being “not of the flesh” (*nirāmisa*) is one of the five characteristics of *sammāsamādhi* (AN 5.27). There certainly is physical rapture in the jhānas, but, again, it is a *symptom* of the mind having successfully transcended the hindrances. Bodily pleasure is a palpable proxy for a mind properly detached from unwholesome states; it’s not beneficial in and of itself, and it’s unjustified to assume that because certain pleasant physical sensations in a meditative state don’t arise based on outside objects or people, they automatically cannot fall within the five cords of sensual pleasure, and that delight in them is thus not unskillful. Unskillfulness depends solely on one’s attitude, and not on the characteristics of a given experience.

The pleasure of jhāna arises and intensifies *because* one is cultivating a dispassionate and disinterested attitude in regard to the entire domain of the body. The suffering and burden of craving that was there before has been lifted ([hence the Buddha’s comparison with relief from debt, illness, etc.](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=dn2#dn2:69.1-dn2:74.2)), and this relief has an acute and substantial physical counterpart. If gaining more pleasure becomes the main goal, the dispassion that was the source the relief is no longer the priority, and you’ve fallen back to the five hindrances, or never surmounted them.

The simile of the bathman kneading the bath powder to the perfect moisture points to the fact that if you begin to internally *relish* the pleasure of the first jhāna, it’s too wet. If the pleasure is not there, it’s too dry, and it shows that mentally you’re not sustaining the perspective that keeps the mind detached from the hindrances. The middle point is where the mind is indifferent to the pleasure, and yet it’s doing everything right for it to manifest, i.e., regarding desire for any bodily experience as the taking on a burdensome debt.

Consider also how in AN 6.63, sensuality is defined as passionate intention (*saṅkapparāga*) for the likeable and agreeable objects of the five senses: the pleasant bodily sensations (“touches cognizable by the body”) that do factually arise in jhāna are not magically exempted from this, and if the mind is thirsting after those, it’s not withdrawn from sensuality. Conversely, to reiterate, it also means that the presence of agreeable bodily sensations in jhāna does not *intrinsically* make it sensual, because if it is true jhāna, the mind will not be passionately inclining towards them.

This is why it wasn’t immediately obvious to the Buddha that the pleasure of jhāna should not be feared. He would’ve been apprehensive of the physical pleasure in and of itself, overlooking the fact that the attitude of the mind towards it is different from that of any other pleasure (i.e., thirsting for more). Those who enter the first jhāna are already said to be “hungerless, extinguished, crossed over, and gone beyond in that respect” (*nicchāta nibbutā tiṇṇā pāraṅgatā tadaṅgena*, AN 9.33. See also AN 9.47 and other repetitions in that chapter that compare all of the jhānas to Nibbāna). The notion that there can be hungering after the pleasure of the first jhāna—where all such unskillful resolves have already ceased *without remainder* as per MN 78—and that it can even become tiresome eventually, blatantly contradicts the Suttas.

>What’s more, the suttas frequently describe the fourth jhāna as the basis for developing such psychic powers as the ability to read minds and to recollect past lifetimes. This would be impossible if the fourth jhāna were simply a thinking process of abandoning unskillful qualities and developing skillful ones. But it would be entirely possible that these psychic powers could develop from a still, full-body awareness.

It’s much less reasonable to expect absorption to result in psychic powers. Zooming *out* of experience, which is what *sammāsamādhi* is about, rather than zooming further and further *into* it, is what allows the mind to wield power over what it’s now fully detached from, and to no longer be limited by concerns of the present to the point where it can remember previous lives. It also guarantees that those aren't hallucinations, which easily result from absorption.

>So given that the one-pointed oblivious definition of jhāna requires that the Buddha was either devious or incompetent in his teachings—using “body” to mean not-body, and “thinking” to mean not-thinking—we have to reject that definition of what jhāna entails.

This is correct. But the distinction between absorption in one fine point and in whole-body pleasure is not at all fundamental. There is no reason to assume the latter is any more conducive to the right kind of knowledge and vision than the former, and, as we’ve already seen, the latter can easily fall within the scope of sensuality, while the former drifts more into the domain of delusion.

>In other words, we have to assume that vitakka and vicāra have the same meaning both in the first jhāna and in the stage prior to it. This means that the difference between the first jhāna and the stage prior to it is not a matter of thinking and not thinking. As we’ll see, it’s more a matter of what you’re thinking about and why.

>In the second stage, the first jhāna, you engage in enough vitakka and vicāra focused on the theme of your concentration to maximize the pleasure and rapture you can gain from staying with that theme and to spread that pleasure and rapture throughout the body.

The implication here seems to be that even though *vitakka* and *vicāra* are the same, in jhāna they are limited to a specific topic, and this is not the case. It is said in AN 4.77 that the “range of one in jhāna” (*jhāyissa jhānavisayo*) is one of the four inconceivables. This refers to the fact that even in the first jhāna there are no constraints as to the specifics of where the mind moves (in this case through *vitakkavicāra*). The mind has achieved the first stage of *limitlessness*. There is no fixed answer to the question “What is someone in the first jhāna thinking about?”, and yet the mind is undoubtedly unified and undistracted [*within* what used to distract it](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an9.42#an9.42:3.1-an9.42:4.2).

We even see [from the Buddha’s own account](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an3.63) that changing postures during jhāna practice poses no difficulty. [AN 4.12](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an4.12) explains why this is the case, showing also that the body can be calm and undisturbed even during movement. As already explained, this is because this physical calm is a byproduct of the right mental attitude that’s been cultivated long enough. It’s stated as well that one who cannot bear all of the five senses, not just the tactile faculty, would not be able to enter upon right samādhi (AN 5.113). If we look carefully, we find that most approaches to meditation revolve around cocooning the mind away from the five senses well beyond what the Suttas say is necessary, which is physical seclusion with virtue established beforehand. It’s only the degree of the cocooning, what’s happening within it, and the narrative behind it that can vary. Whether you enclose the mind in a tiny vial or in a larger gallon-sized jug, you are still *limiting* it, and this is the opposite of what the Buddha encourages:

>“Sandha, meditate like a thoroughbred, not like a wild colt.

>And how does a wild colt meditate? A wild colt, tied up by the feeding trough, meditates: ‘Fodder, fodder!’ Why is that? Because it doesn’t occur to the wild colt tied up by the feeding trough: ‘What task will the horse trainer have me do today? How should I respond?’ Tied up by the feeding trough it meditates: ‘Fodder, fodder!’

>In the same way, take a certain untrained person who has gone to the forest, the root of a tree, or an empty hut... They meditate relying on earth, water, fire, and air. They meditate relying on the extent of infinite space, infinite consciousness, nothingness, or neither-perception-nor-non-perception. *They meditate relying on this world or the other world. They meditate relying on what is seen, heard, thought, cognized, attained, sought, or explored by the mental faculty.* That’s how an untrained person meditates.

>And how does a thoroughbred meditate? *A fine thoroughbred, tied up by the feeding trough, doesn’t meditate: ‘Fodder, fodder!’* Why is that? Because it occurs to the fine thoroughbred tied up by the feeding trough: ‘What task will the horse trainer have me do today? How should I respond?’ >Tied up by the feeding trough they don’t meditate: ‘Fodder, fodder!’ For that fine thoroughbred regards the use of the goad as a debt, a bond, a loss, a misfortune.

>In the same way, take a certain fine thoroughbred person who has gone to the forest, the root of a tree, or an empty hut …They don’t meditate relying on earth, water, fire, and air. They don’t meditate relying on the extent of infinite space, infinite consciousness, nothingness, or neither-perception-nor-non-perception. They don’t meditate relying on this world or the other world. They don’t meditate relying on what is seen, heard, thought, cognized, attained, sought, or explored by the mental faculty. Yet they do meditate.

>When a fine thoroughbred meditates like this, the gods together with Indra, Brahmā, and the Progenitor worship them from afar:

>‘Homage to you, O thoroughbred! Homage to you, supreme among men! We don’t understand what your meditation relies on.’” —AN 11.9

>Bhikkhus, being judicious and recollected, develop limitless *samādhi*. —AN 5.27

>When he sees a sight with the eye, if it’s agreeable he doesn’t harbor passion for it, if it’s disagreeable he’s not averse to it. He lives with recollection of the body established and with a limitless mind. And he understands as it is the liberation by mind and liberation by understanding where those bad, detrimental qualities cease without remainder. —MN 38

To shed more light on this matter, let’s take a closer look at [MN 19](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn19). There’s one subtle and often overlooked qualification that occurs there regarding the type of thinking the Buddha used to discern the danger in unwholesome states, and which he concluded would bar his mind from fully calming down:

>“Still, thinking and pondering along with it (*anuvitakkayato anuvicārayato*) for too long would tire my body. And when the body is tired, the mind is bothered. And when the mind is bothered, it’s far from composure. So I established, settled, unified, and composed my mind internally. Why is that? So that my mind would not be bothered.”

The *anu-* prefix, added to both *vitakka* and *vicāra*, means “along with”. What this indicates is that even though those thoughts were skillful, they were still a form of the mind going “with the grain”—the five hindrances were still subtly in control. That striving was not something he could’ve skipped, however, but now that it has served its purpose, he goes on to “compose his mind internally”. It’s easy to assume that this means he simply shrunk the scope of *vitakkavicāra* and went on to limit it to something more specific such as the breath or thoughts of a particular subject. But this is not what the Sutta itself goes on to describe:

>“Suppose it’s the last month of summer, when all the crops have been gathered within a village, and a cowherd must take care of the cattle. While at the root of a tree or in the open, he need only remember that the cattle are there. *In the same way, I needed only to remember that those phenomena were there.* My effort was roused up and steadfast, my recollection was established and lucid, my body was calm and unperturbed, and my mind was composed and collected. Quite disjoined from sensuality, disjoined from detrimental phenomena, with thinking and with pondering, with joy and comfort born of separation, I abided having entered upon the first jhāna.”

Note the comparison with the cattle being left to roam around and the cowherd no longer needing to constantly control them like before. The Buddha chose his similes carefully. This alludes to how, once coarse unskillful states have been reined in through active effort of contemplation, *vitakkavicāra* can now be left to roam freely as long as one is able to maintain recollection (*sati*) over those phenomena. This is how *vitakkavicāra* in the first jhāna is not constricted within any singular subject even though the mind is definitely unified. When mindfulness becomes imperturbable, the content of thoughts no longer matters, since it was not their content that induced the hindrances, but rather the lack of separation (*viveka*) from that content, and that separation is precisely what mindfulness creates—a vantage point, as it were. This is spelled out more explicitly in Madhyama Āgama 102, the Chinese parallel to MN 19, where the following description comes in place of the first jhāna:

>Let me rather keep my mind in check within, continuously dwelling in inner tranquility, unified, having attained concentration, so that my mind will not be troubled. Thereafter I kept my mind in check within, continuously dwelling in inner tranquility, unified, having attained concentration, and my mind was no longer troubled. \[If\] a thought without sensual desire (ill will ... cruelty ...) arose in me, I further \[allowed\] thoughts to arise that were inclined toward the Dharma and in accordance with the Dharma. Why was that? \[Because\] I did not see that countless evil and unwholesome states would arise because of \[such thoughts\]. It is as in the last month of autumn, when the entire harvest has been collected, a cowherd boy sets the cows free in the uncultivated fields and is mindful of them, thinking, “My cows are there in the herd.” Why is that? Because the cowherd boy does not see that he would be scolded, beaten, or imprisoned for any trespassing. For this reason he is mindful of them thus, “My cows are there in the herd.”

The general nature of all thinking—the recognition that a thought is always a *dhamma* regardless of its content—is the place of unification of mind (*cittekaggatā*). To bring up AN 5.27 again, this is the other essential quality of proper *samādhi* that is not fulfilled by absorption: nothing needs to be held back, excluded, or controlled, and instead everything has been unified within the same overarching theme.

Furthermore, absorption of any kind by definition cannot qualify as “composing the mind internally”, since anything that one can absorb oneself in will be a sight, sound, smell, taste, tactile object, or mental image, and these are all *external* (the six external sense fields). And if we carefully consider what *sati* is even in ordinary situations, we will see that in a sense it is already not bound to any specific sense object, and *samādhi* is of course nothing but a solid and imperturbable mindfulness:

Imagine you’re driving and are about to enter a highway that has speed limit, and you want to be mindful not to exceed it. How do you go about this? Where is the quality of minfulness there? Is it in intently paying attention to every muscle in your leg lengthening and contracting as you operate the pedals, implying that if you stop doing that, you will exceed the speed limit? Or is it a broader awareness at the back of your mind that would remain even when you’re focused on something else, such as talking with the passenger or listening to the radio? Sure enough, you may from time to time focus your attention on the speed meter and adjust your pressure on the gas pedal or hit the brakes, but all of this would be a *result* of being mindful not to exceed the speed limit. And you can’t pin this mindfulness down to some specific sense object because, even when your focus is taken by something else, it’s still there. And it will remain there, at the back of your mind without needing to actively refresh it, for as long as you don’t get overly captivated by any particular thing, mental or physical, within the field of experience. If we also consider the nature of what a memory (another translation for *sati*) is, we’ll see that it’s something that *contexualizes* something else that we directly perceive with our senses.

Similarly, when the Buddha says that upon composing his mind internally he needed only to be mindful that those phenomena were there, it means that he simply needed to *not* allow his attention to become narrowed by anything in particular, like the cowherd doesn’t need to chase after any individual cow anymore and can instead leisurely sit at the root of a tree, keeping sight of the whole herd from afar without forgetting about it altogether. Not by coincidence, this is also the [principle of sense restraint](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn38#mn38:35.1-mn38:35.9), which is said to give rise to joy (SN 35.94, SN 35.97).

The reason why even though he had purified his mind from coarse unskillful thoughts it was still not at peace is that disturbance is due to “taking up” (*upadhi*), and particular unwholesome thoughts are only a secondary byproduct of this. So, even if you stop all deliberate defiled acts of body, speech, and thought and volitionally think only skillful thoughts, the taking up of some aspects of your experience will still be there, and this can only be remedied by a sufficient degree of mindfulness (in the proper sense explained here: a background recognition that expands the mind beyond particularities). Thus it is said that the first jhāna is born [out of being detached (*viveka*) from *upadhi* or taking up](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn64#mn64:9.2).

As seen from AN 9.34, the pleasure of each jhāna is determined by the extent of affliction that it respectively transcends. The relief is determined by the old burden, which previously used to be “everything”. From the previous point of view, it can be said that nothing is felt because the mind now abides disconnected, looking down from above at what *used* to be everything, and *that* is pleasant. It’s not a new pleasure generated from scratch that steals the show from what was there before, and in this Sutta this is said to be the principle behind the pleasure of Nibbāna. In the same way as not feeling the burden of the five aggregates and not being confined by them while the five aggregates are there is the pleasure of Nibbāna for an Arahant, [no longer feeling the burden of lust for the five cords of sensual pleasure and not being confined by them while they’re still perceived](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an9.42) is the pleasure of the first jhāna (ditto for the others) and this is why even this can be sufficient to attain Arahantship if there is sufficient wisdom. Mindfulness in the proper sense is what enables all of this.

>‘Sensual pleasures in the present and in the future, sensual perceptions in the present and in the future; both of these are Māra’s domain, Māra’s realm, and Māra’s territory. They conduce to bad, unskillful qualities such as longing, ill will, and impulsivity. And they create an obstacle for a noble disciple training here. Why don’t I abide with an *abundant, expanded mind, having surmounted the world and stabilized the mind*? Then I will have no more bad, unskillful qualities such as longing, ill will, and impulsivity. And by giving them up my mind will be *boundless, limitless,* and well developed.’ —MN 106

(...)

>From that, it’s been further argued that because the suttas devote more space to the practice of using thought to abandon unskillful qualities and to develop skillful qualities than it does to absorptive practices like mindfulness of breathing, that kind of thought most deserves to be called right concentration.

There are no “absorptive practices” in the Suttas, and Ānāpānasati is no exception. This becomes clear enough if we, having put aside all the baggage of modern interpretations, carefully consider what *sati* is to begin with as above, and why the Buddha might have chosen that term instead of something more in line with the idea of absorption.

The breath serves as particularly suitable anchor that *prevents* absorption, since it perpetually and inevitably underlies every moment of our experience. No matter how captivated you become in an object of your attention, whether physical or mental, all you need to restore the overview of the totality of your present experience is remember that you’re breathing—that sits “at the bottom” of everything else. At the basic level, this enables the mind to regain perspective over the ongoing movements of *vitakkavicāra*; it doesn’t *replace* them. It allows for discernment of *paṭiccasamuppāda* or [simultaneous inter-dependence](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=sn12.67#sn12.67:7.2-sn12.67:7.4) too, which is said to be the cornerstone of the Dhamma: it becomes clear that you can only have even the most personal and dear of thoughts and perceptions because you continue to breathe, which is in itself not a guarantee.

If, however, you turn the breath into a preoccupation of its own to focus on, the entire purpose of it is lost. You are no longer mindful in the right sense, and your mind is now constricted again, by something else. The point is to achieve balance, where neither the breath nor particular thoughts and sense objects are allowed to take the mind’s full focus, and this is what keeps it expanded. This aligns with the general principle of mindfulness of the body, which is said to be [like a strong post that keeps any of the six senses from dragging all of the others into their respective domains, while also making the mind limitless](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.247/en/sujato?lang=en). Similarly, the final result of *ānāpānasati* is that the six senses “sit down” and no longer pull towards or away from disagreeable objects **which are still there**, and not that some or all of the senses fall asleep. Mindfulness of breathing is therefore something that one can maintain one’s whole waking life if one is diligent, as instructed in SN 47.20. If it has been fully developed, it would [effortlessly remain up until one’s last breath](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn62#mn62:30.2). If the breath were meant to be an object of focus, this would be unrealistic, and would seriously hamper one’s ability to function.

There are several other tangible examples in the Suttas that illustrate the general nature of *sati*, and how no absorption or concentration involved or associated with it. Among them are [AN 6.19 ](https://suttacentral.net/an6.19/en/sujato?lang=en)and [AN 6.26](https://suttacentral.net/an6.26/en/sujato), and both of these tie in with AN 11.9 quoted above, where right meditation is said to be the opposite direction of intent observation and mechanical repetition. AN 6.26 even contains the same phrase found at the beginning of the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta, and it is clear that none of those recollections are things that one can fixate one’s attention on in the way the *satipaṭṭhānas* are typically practiced. In SN 3.13, it's not hard to see that for the king practicing mindfulness meant keeping a broader perspective while eating.

The sensible, unbiased conclusion is not that the Buddha taught a different type of mindfulness that is so different from the general standard that it deserves a different name altogether, but that absorptive practices are simply a misinterpretation enabled by the ambiguity of the texts, a failure even by respected scholars to take the entire canon into account and try to extract a single, internally coherent message from it—[which ought to be possible according to the Buddha himself](https://suttacentral.net/mn104/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=main&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin#5.2)—and perhaps most strongly by people’s natural tendency to lose perspective of what matters whenever something happens to feel good.

Moreover, increased powers of observation and focus, which is what absorptive practices develop, is not what allows for full understanding of the five aggregates. In fact, whenever you become absorbed in anything, you *forget* the form, feeling, perceptions, intentions, and consciousness that are the basis of that experience you are now immersed in, and that unseen basis is where the sense of self finds footing, not in what you observe in front of you. For example, if you allow yourself to become fixated on what you’re seeing, that automatically feeds into the tacit assumption that you *are* your eyes, i.e. form. If, on the other hand, you don’t focus too much on anything specific while sights are there, it becomes possible to consider how your eyes are also objects in the world, and that there is nothing ultimately preventing those eyes from deteriorating to the point where you’d lose your eyesight. The same applies of course for all the other sense bases.

This is how impermanence and the grave error of taking things as “mine” becomes revealed at the fundamental level. This will not happen through any perceptions, no matter how detailed, extraordinary, or refined, that are gleaned through direct observation (which, knowingly or not, only further maintains the tacit assumption of a separate “observer” behind the observation). And, in line with the above points, it is this same sense of being the center of experience that generates the burden of the five hindrances, so it’s wrong to think that observation is inadequate only in the context of *vipassanā* and not *samatha*.

We can thus begin to see how exactly the jhānas support understanding and intrinsically slant the mind towards Nibbāna and letting go in a much more profound way than soothing it through almost arbitrary means: the more one abides in the mere first jhāna, the more one is familiarizing the mind from a way of regarding things in which it is no longer the agent behind the senses. No matter the strength of one’s willpower to renounce sensual pleasures, until one is able to gain that separation from the senses and becomes used to it to the point where it becomes much more pleasant than wallowing in sensual preoccupations, one is liable to succumb to the pull of the five cords of sensuality. This is the true meaning of [this famous statement](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn14#mn14:4.2-mn14:4.3).

Finally, a few remarks on the so called “Jhāna Wars” that are prevalent these days:

One of the major culprits of this debate is that people assume that almost any pleasant meditative experience can be called jhāna, and this is taking things the wrong way round. Jhāna is the most refined aspect of the Middle Way, to the point that all the previous seven factors of the path are said to be its requisites (MN 117). Any given meditative state is either in line with that Middle Way, in which case it deserves to be called jhāna, or not, in which case it’s wrong samādhi. One of the most representative explanations of this middle way is found in [MN 134](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn134) (and is said there to be fundamental to the spiritual life): one does not nurture longing for any item of the five aggregates that hasn’t yet arisen, nor does one become complacent with those that are present. As SN 1.1 puts it: you don’t push forward, but you don’t stand still either.

If you’re trying to get the pleasure of jhāna to arise and the current discomfort to cease (e.g., by focusing on something more pleasant like the breath), justifying that as a “wholesome craving”, [you are longing for the future](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn134#mn134:8-13.4-mn134:8-13.5). If, on the other hand, you throw your hands up with the view that there is nothing to attain, don’t strive to free the mind from hindrances, and let your mind go wherever it wants in choiceless awareness, [you allow yourself to be dragged along by presently arisen phenomena](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn134#mn134:8-13.9-mn134:8-13.10). This means that there is by definition only one “real” set of jhānas forming the 8th factor of the Noble Path, and only one way to achieve them: neither pushing forward, nor standing still, completely and to the full extent. This is why every true jhāna is always categorically wholesome.

What every approach to jhāna that gets compared in the ongoing debate does is arbitrarily justify some forms of pushing forward and some forms of standing still, meaning that craving is still there even if only subtly. The attained pleasure is not born of the temporary cessation of craving and appropriation, making it a temporary liberation of mind, and a way of [“touching the deathless element with the body”](https://suttacentral.net/an6.46/en/thanissaro?lang=en&reference=none&highlight=false”), but simply a way of successfully gratifying one’s craving with something comparatively less detrimental than external pleasures. It is also not in line with the first factor of the path, right view, which recognizes that what you feel (*vedanā*, pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral) at any given time is not the problem, but rather the simultaneously present craving to change what you feel in one way or the other.

How, then, do you then go by the middle? Mindfulness: you establish your mind in a broader context that will prevent you from being carried away by what is present, but, at the same time, since it exists in a different plane than thoughts and perceptions of the five senses, does not require replacing or interfering with them. Establishing and protecting that context requires effort, so it’s not a matter of total letting go to the point of negligence, but it’s not a strained effort either because any kind of strain only comes when you try to control the specifics of your present experience instead of your context towards it.

The right, balanced practice is not something you get to subjectively decide; it is predetermined by the nature and workings of experience itself. This is why the Buddha said the Dhamma is an ancient path that he discovered; he didn’t create or devise his own idiosyncratic Middle Way, and neither can anybody else.

The fact that the practice of jhāna is fundamentally about aligning oneself with the unchanging principle of the middle path and of right mindfulness, and not about the pleasure that secondarily results from it, can be seen from the otherwise inexplicable statements in [this chapter](https://suttacentral.net/an1.394-574/en/sujato?lang=en) of the Aṅguttara Nikāya. There it’s said that any form of contextualizing one’s experience taught by the Buddha, many having nothing directly to do with jhāna, would make one “not devoid of jhāna” if practiced even for a fingersnap, and the pleasure of jhāna will obviously not come in a fingersnap for anyone initially. The statement only holds if any of these practices is done properly, i.e., with the right mindfulness that contextualizes things instead of pushing them away and replacing them.

From what’s been said so far, it can also become clear why in the Buddha’s outline of the training (MN 107), jhāna comes up only at a late stage, and the first task is always virtue to develop virtue. He even said that for one who lacks virtue, the vital condition for samādhi is destroyed (AN 5.24).

Proper virtue is the most rudimentary application of the Middle Way. It’s not only about keeping the training rules externally unbroken, but also, paradoxically at first glance, about not clinging to them (MN 48). In other words, the attitude with which one keeps the precepts also needs to be rightly tuned: consistently saying “no” to all forms of misconduct without thereby saying “yes” to one’s saying no. You will inevitably have to cling to your virtue at first to make it spotless. But the goal is to be able to keep it perfectly without clinging to it. Otherwise, as the Suttas explicitly say, it won’t be the kind of virtue that can evolve into *samādhi*.

Lastly, it must be emphasized that the actual Sutta jhānas are not "lite jhānas". They are much more profound and transcendental, but in a different sense, than the most intensely fixed states of absorption regarded as jhāna today. Their profundity is owing to the subtlety, nuance, and quasi-paradoxical nature of the Middle Way: how, in the midst of ample movement, the mind can be still. In the midst of mundanity, the mind is established in the supramundane, and this is why they inevitably carry over to one’s normal life even if one doesn’t want them to.

    [This except from an old talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nz9a1dYdN0), in light of what was said here, serves to illustrate how the jhānas are ***already*** “an island that no flood can overwhelm” (temporarily of course), which is why they're said to be the way to “touch the deathless element with the body” (AN 6.46).

    >“Bhikkhus, the uninstructed worldling speaks of ‘the ocean, the ocean.’ But that is not the ocean in the Noble One’s Discipline; that is only a great mass of water, a great expanse of water.

    >“The eye, bhikkhus, is the ocean for a person; its tide consists of forms. One who withstands that tide consisting of forms is said to have crossed the ocean of the eye with its waves, whirlpools, sharks, and demons. Crossed over, gone beyond, the brahmin stands on high ground.

    >“The ear, bhikkhus, is the ocean for a person…. The mind is the ocean for a person; its tide consists of mental phenomena. One who withstands that tide consisting of mental phenomena is said to have crossed the ocean of the mind with its waves, whirlpools, sharks, and demons. Crossed over, gone beyond, the brahmin stands on high ground.”  
    —SN 35.228

    As pleasant as it may be, a state where the tides disappear from view is of no help in understanding how to properly withstand them.

    But it is perfectly self-explanatory why it is beneficial to frequently abide in a state where not being affected by the tides ***is*** what’s pleasant.

    Outside of samādhi, the body does feel the pull of agreeable and disagreeable sense objects, but for one who fully understands the deathless with the mind (not a mystical state outside of the aggregates, but rather the ever-present possibility to not crave amidst what incites craving, i.e., "withstand the tide"), that's a non-issue, because the mind is where the whole mass of suffering exists. An agitated body is just an insignificant nuisance in comparison, and that's why an Arahant doesn't *need* to protect their samādhi anymore ([MN 107](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn107#mn107:11.2), SN 16.5, SN 17.30). 

    For a noble one, who knows how direct their mind to the deathless or "cessation" with the mind, the body eventually follows along, i.e. jhānas (AN 9.33). The body itself (the six senses as a unitary whole, not a collection of sensations) ceases to experience the pull of the things that used to pull it while they're still present (SN 35.247, SN 35.97), and that relief results in a very physical joy, ease, "rapture", etc., which is just a byproduct and a further substantiation of the same mental understanding. This is always temporary, but abiding in it repeatedly is how a noble disciple's understanding of the deathless eventually reaches fulfillment, and samādhi becomes just a nice-to-have.

### Citta "being-in-relation-to" phenomena

Dear Bhante Anigha,

I was reading your recent essay "Unyoked from biology" and I had a question on footnote #11, regarding Citta

>And this is why the *citta,* despite this special status, cannot rightly be considered a “soul”, a “self”, or “mine”. In order to be so, it would need to be able to stand on its own feet and not be liable to change, but its very defining trait is that of “being-in-relation-to” other phenomena that are inherently impermanent and bound for destruction, after which there could not be a *citta* in relation to them.

How should this be understood in reference to 'Mano pubbangama dhamma'. Since the mind is the forerunner of all phenomena, does this not imply that it is the phenomena that are 'in-relation-to' the Citta rather than the other way ?

Also, wouldn't 'Citto pubbangama dhamma' be a more accurate phrase to describe the relationship? Or is this verse just an example of where mano and citta are used synonymously.

Thanks in advance for your clarification 🙏

    >Or is this verse just an example of where mano and citta are used synonymously.

    It is. The verse refers to the fact that taking an external point of view to your own experience is impossible; every phenomenon you can conceivably cognize has to exist with your mano as basis, both as a mere sense base (as you wouldn't be able to see sights without your eyes) and also in the sense of citta (there cannot *not* be an attitude of greed or non-greed, aversion or non-aversion, and delusion or non-delusion in relation to every phenomenon, and that attitude also precedes them and is more general than them). There is no "outside" to this, not even in the farthest corners of the universe.

    >So in that sense, the attitude 'precedes' the phenomena; but not in a temporal sense.

    Yes, I didn't mean it temporally. And which determines which depends on which point of view you take. So if you're looking at an arisen thing, the attitude towards it is the counterpart that it cannot not exist without. But if then you start regarding that background attitude as some sort of higher privileged entity, you see that there could be no background attitude without something to harbor an attitude in regard to. So neither of the two can rightly be called the master of the other one, and that's the point of *paṭiccasamuppāda*.

### Is Painful Practice Avoidable?



- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1dr20h8/is_painful_practice_avoidable/lbbqaph/)** _2024-07-02 18:49:01 *(in reply to a comment not included)*:

    >In simple terms, the more you've been wanting things to be a certain particular way, the more there'll be displeasure on account of how things actually are.

    It’s like the displeasure of withdrawal from an addiction. If you were used to 100mg of caffeine per day, quitting will not be as unpleasant as for someone who was taking 1000mg (and equally, you will realize the extent of your addiction *only when you try to quit*; before that point, you will always tend to underestimate it).

    But ultimately yes, the whole point of the Dhamma is that displeasure is not suffering in itself, so the fact that you might experience that pain is an issue only to the extent that you don't see the Dhamma. 

    And it doesn’t say that unpleasant practice = slow practice; they are two separate variables. If your faculties—with faith being the basis of all the others—allow you to steadily keep and further develop the context that displeasure is not suffering, you can still reach liberation just as quickly, or even more so, than someone whose addiction was not as strong. You’re not “atoning for your past sins” through renunciation, which was [the view of the Jains.](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn14#mn14:17.4-mn14:17.9)

### For Ven. Anigha.  What is Pali/Sanskrit term for "Context"?

Venerable Anigha,  (or anyone who knows).

I am not 100% certain that I get all the subleties of the frequently used teaching of a "context" in HH videos and teachings.

Is there a pali or sanskrit word? Is there such a concept in the suttas,  Abhidhamma, *Abhidharma-kośa*, or commentaries (*translated to English*)?

Is it *avijñaptirūpa*?  If "context" isn't a conscious mental state, is it citta-viprayukta-saṃskāra?  Is "context" a specific prāpti  of Sabhāgatā of specific concept  of context?

Thank you!

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1dlg93a/for_ven_anigha_what_is_palisanskrit_term_for/l9pvnbp/)** _2024-06-22 04:00:14:

    There's more than one word that semantically corresponds to it, although it isn't a literal rendering of any particular word.

    All the derivatives of *anu + pass* (*anupassī* as in satipaṭṭhāna; *samanupassanā*; *samanupassati*) are the first that come to mind. A lot of the time that's interpreted as "observation", but you cannot "observe" the 4 Noble Truths in satipaṭṭhāna as the Buddha instructs in the way you would observe a chair. They are contexts.

    "Context" would also correspond to _saññā_ in some cases where it's not being strictly used as one of the aggregates. When the Buddha uses terms like _pahānasaññā, virāgasaññā_ and _sabbaloke anabhiratasaññā_, he's talking about contexts, just as when he says _anicce dukkha_, _anattasaññā_, etc.

### Can someone define the word “context” as used in the HH videos?

It seems as if the term is referring to a specific parameter of “context”, phenomenological, ethical, dhammic, etc., but each time I think I understand, I encounter a video that seems to have a different nuance to it. Any clarification will be appreciated. 

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1dlcxyq/can_someone_define_the_word_context_as_used_in/l9q30gl/)** _2024-06-22 05:08:56:

    When you're in the supermarket and there's a knowledge floating "at the back of your mind" that you're supposed to be back home by a certain time, that's a context. 

    When we refer to context, we refer to that overall "direction" of experience, not to something specific within that direction. And the reason why it's important is because it's that same direction—on a subtler but simultaneous plane to less fundamental contexts like the one above—that craving and all wholesome and unwholesome states are found. They are never found at the plane of, say, your visual perceptions of shapes and colors at the cleaning aisle of the supermarket.

    It sounds awfully trivial, but most people overlook that to one degree or another in the way they practice.

    >Venerable. So the context could be a general sense of stress, and more wider to that, a mental image of this or that person you remember doing this or that, or the mental image of an unpayed bill?

    No, as soon as you start specifying and describing, it's not the context anymore. It becomes a mental sense object at the foreground, and now another context is behind that (a desire to figure out what the context is, for example). 

    The context is what it is only for as long as you're not trying to "look" at it or describe it. Hence it's about learning to be peripherally aware of it without having to turn your attention to it.

    >In recognizing that context, one could then stand still in regard to it, and recollect the origin, the body, as that which comes first before any sense of self, and that it is subject to old age, disease and death.

    Even though this *sounds* right on paper, those thoughts about the body would still be foreground sense objects. The actual origin/context, the actual body, is peripheral to that and remains overlooked.

    The difficulty lies in that there are no alarms telling you that you're trying to attend to the context directly and thereby overlooking the actual context, so it's extremely easy to fall of the wagon while still thinking you're doing it properly. Hence the need to not take anything for granted and operate from the basic premise that mistakes could be occurring at any given time.

    >If I come to realize that negative feeling is present in the midst of acting out (mental or external) - is this not the moment to cease acting out by speech or body, and to endure not taking the bait of engaging further with the "inner" speech/monologue? To recognize unskillful thoughts and not give them the fuel of further engagement? And then simultaneously endure whatever feeling is left for as long as it is present without trying to think my way out of that general negative mood and negative feeling.

    I'm not sure if you mean to say you're using the negative feeling as a criterion for whether you're acting out or not. If that's the case, that's not the way to tell. You could be having a negative feeling on account of a skillful attitude. If anything, that’s most often going to be the case for as long as the mind is not cured from sensual addiction and the first three fetters because you’re going against the grain.

    Secondly, I assume you mean you stop the "inner" speech that's unskillful, not that you stop *all* inner speech as if that were the issue. Inner speech is just vitakkavicāra; it’s unskillful when the inner speech is driven by an attitude of passion or aversion. But that attitude endures on a completely separate, peripheral, and simultaneous domain to the content of the inner speech (like the above example of the enduring context while walking around in the supermarket), so you can't tell whether there is unskillfulness by looking at the latter, just as as you can't tell whether someone else has ill will or any other state internally purely from the way they act and talk. There is some overlap of course, but it’s *far* from total.

    >As I understand it, this is "finding the gateway" and then maintaining/guarding my recognition of presently enduring feeling.

    You find the gateway when you clearly see that simultaneous peripheral attitude that has nothing to do with the content of the inner dialogue itself. If there's still a faint unnoticed assumption that the gateway is guarded at the level of  specific thoughts, then that's not really the gateway.

    If you simply recognize the presence of, say, a depressed mood enduring simultaneously with depressed thoughts, and don’t do try to do anything else but keep the recognition of "with this, this is“, that would be closer to guarding the gateway. Proper *simultaneous* recognition of an enduring mood (body, etc.)—not a *replacement* of the previous thoughts with thoughts about the mood—would defuse the actual root of the unwholesomeness (ignorance/assumption, not seeing the principle of simultaneity) without any need to neither continue NOR stop the thoughts that were there. That's the Middle Way.

    >In recognizing this, I recognize non-self.

    Not necessarily, unless things are actually being seen as above. As I wrote, it’s very easy to be implementing exactly the same ideas on paper on two different occasions, and yet the actual body, mood, etc., is being overlooked on one of them and some subtle form of management is inadvertently taking place (without any "alarm" informing you), and you wouldn't be able to tell if you assumed that just by implementing those theoretically correct ideas you're implementing not-self. So it's better to always assume that you're most likely not recognizing not-self. You lose nothing by assuming that; it'll just help prevent complacency. When you actually recognize it, it won't matter at all whether you tell yourself that you recognize it.

    >Going back to the body from my earlier example...

    Ditto for all that follows.

### Clarification regarding HH descriptions of MN10

Note: I am posting this on request from Venerable Anigha, who will post his response at some point soon.  The perspective I outlined here is, after reading his response, obviously derived from more contemporary perspectives of anapanasati.  I think it's pretty easy to see how I built up this perspective regarding what Ajahn Nyanamoli is talking about, and Venerable Anigha does a great job of explaining why it is incorrect.  From my own experience, what I've outlined here more or less feels like juggling -- he brought up the simile of the mountain cow, and its relevance is quite obvious.  My perspective was obviously wrong somewhere, but without giving up the idea of "moving" from point A to B to C, etc, I don't think I would have ever come around to what is actually meant.  I think that this post -- and his response -- will be very useful for clearing up wrong notions about the practice of anapanasati, especially since I've dove pretty deep into the wrong pond.   With all that said, feel free to contribute your own thoughts about anything I've said, the only goal here is to learn and hopefully help others to connect the dots as well - I'm sure the perspective I've outlined here will be shared by some readers to varying extents (and to many, be obviously incorrect, in which case your input is especially encouraged).

In MN10, the sutta states: He trains like this: ‘I’ll breathe in calming the bodily activity.’ He trains like this: ‘I’ll breathe out calming the bodily activity.’

Now, in this video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI0GVhw0bgs&list=PLUPMn2PfEqIwuLnCiCoXvgcD89ZQj9TKi&index=2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI0GVhw0bgs&list=PLUPMn2PfEqIwuLnCiCoXvgcD89ZQj9TKi&index=2) \[Recollectedness of Breathing | Revisiting Anapanasati Meditation Practice\]

Ajahn seems to describe this as being recollected of the presence of calm in your present experience.

In this essay: [https://www.hillsidehermitage.org/notes-on-meditation/](https://www.hillsidehermitage.org/notes-on-meditation/)

It seems to be described more along the lines of -- while I know that I am breathing, I maintain an intention (through recollection) to calm the body through breathing.

In this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwRqWW79kFg&list=PLUPMn2PfEqIwuLnCiCoXvgcD89ZQj9TKi&index=6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwRqWW79kFg&list=PLUPMn2PfEqIwuLnCiCoXvgcD89ZQj9TKi&index=6) \[How to calm your mind\]

It seems to center around calming of your aversion to enduring the experience that arises within your recollected state of mind.

To me, the last point would be: as I know I am breathing, and phenomena are arising in the middle space between the breathing body and my abstract sense of self, seen in this way, they endure as they are, rather than becoming the center, or totality of your present awareness. And in this way, you endure these things as they have presented themselves, even if that is unpleasant. More or less, the act of turning away or ignoring does have some level of effect on your experience of a particular sense object or phenomena, and by not engaging with that, you are kind of tackling something you are averse to in its full-form, which is naturally unpleasant. So in the last video, he is talking about how to make THAT experience calm, it's not the same as the line "he trains... tranquilizing bodily formations."

So with all of this in mind, my interpretation of the sutta, in terms of the proper way to actually establish the recollection of calming (and make your body calm) would be this way, structurally:

* As you are aware of the totality of the situation
* And your primary point of recollection is that you must endure, not try to change that which arises
* You are aware of the phenomena of the breathing body enduring on its own, and you understand its significance as the basis of your experience from prior contemplation
* You establish the intention to calm your body with each breath.

So the full weight of your intentionality, which is the (only?) direct way we can control the body, is leaning the experience of breathing towards calming the body. That which arises within the experience as phenomena follow with the bodily response to calm, even if it doesn't necessarily feel "right." More or less, establishing and maintaining this recollection (in the structure I described) is the ultimate way to calm your body. In terms of our control, there is nothing more that can be done. And hence, your best bet is to maintain this recollection and keep at it, if you want to calm your physical body.

Is my interpretation accurate? I would say that it still kind of clashes with my understanding of what is described in \[Recollectedness of Breathing | Revisiting Anapanasati Meditation Practice\], but is the most concordant with my own experiences. Because we really do have a direct level of control, the point is just that the particulars of our experience MUST be arising due to more primary physical processes. Hence, "breath-watching," despite being legitimately the most refined type of sensuality (and so in a mundane sense, for the average worldly person, being quite a good and even elevated thing) is really just hiding from and maintaining your own liability to acting out of / appropriating disagreeable, on a more fundamental level. That type of practice essentially says "the problem is in the objects" when the problem is really craving and one's continued liability to it. For somebody with no interest in going beyond, the problem more or less is in the objects, since they don't want to face them or endure them, it's just all about feeling good right now and forever, all the time.

So this practice of calming the body is really just the healthiest way to establish the mind in terms of letting your body relax, it's more effective for calming than absorption (it has to be, if you can't go further than your intention) and doesn't require your direct sense of control in the domain of particular sense objects (another reason why it would have greater efficacy). Perhaps what was meant in the first video is that, as you are aware of calming, you are aware of calm as a phenomena. But the explanation seemed to be closer to: you attend to the calm, and disregard the not-calm. But I don't think this is what was meant.

So overall, it seems like we have two categories of "calming" 1) The sutta description, which refers to calming the body and its events - might also include attending to the presence of calm in the body, which I would take to mean being recollected of the fact that as you have this or that unpleasant experience arise, you simultaneously know that the majority of your body is totally calm, kind of putting the discomfort into a greater perspective. 2) Calming of endurance, which is a mental calming, not a bodily calming.

    If you're keen on approaching the right view by trying to understand how APS is properly practiced, I would strongly advise sticking to the instructions on the topic found in Ajahn Nyanamoli's two books. If they seem overly terse or somehow inadequate, it's only because they haven't been sufficiently understood, not because anything was omitted.

    >The knowledge of breathing in and out doesn’t require any special effort.

    The bottom line is that none of the 16 different possibilities of ānāpānasati practice should be regarded as fundamentally distinct or separate from the others. If you are doing the core of it properly, "recollected he breathes in; recollected he breathes out", you are doing all of them implicitly. In this case, simply enduring the hindrances properly on a mental level, making no direct effort to calm your body (which is always treading on thin ice for someone without the right view) is sufficient for all the bodily calm you really need, factually: the calm of your six senses ceasing to pull towards and away from their objects as in the simile of the six animals, which is exactly the same as you would get from any other form of sati whatsoever (and that is basically the first jhāna). Only once you truly have that (by which point you would've already gotten the right view long ago) can you go further and start emphasizing and "training" in any one of the sixteen aspects.

    So if there's a sense that you need to do "more" and then you act out of that, then right then and there the basic recollection of breathing is not properly established, for if it were it would prevent you from acting out of hindrances. It's like [the simile of the mountain cow](https://suttacentral.net/an9.35/en/sujato?lang=en) who falls between the two rocks because she didn't properly set her foot on the first and hastily went for the second one.

    If you were actually settled in the "basic" anapanasati, you would already be abiding in immaculate contentment [free from hindrances](https://suttacentral.net/sn54.6/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin), and you would take it further not because your mind *wants* you to like before, but because you rationally understand that it'll take you closer to Arahantship (and at that point you would see for yourself what that means, i.e. be at least a sotāpanna).

    >See your breath as something happening underneath whatever else is going on. “Underneath” because it will feel so from the point of view of whatever you are occupied with. “Underneath” because, although at the same time, it is “before”, it is more primordial and closer to the body.

    Be peripherally aware of breathing taking place “underneath” the desire to calm your body down, or anything else that wants you to get mentally engaged in one way or another, and simply sustain that no matter where your 5 senses and mind move.  See that and the breath as two completely unconnected, simultaneously enduring domains.\* There is no "...and then I go to step two".

    \* i.e., the knowledge that breathing is happening (which has nothing to do with sensations in your nostrils or anywhere else; you would still be able to know you're breathing even if all the tactile input was somehow cut off because it's an *action*) is present "underneath" bodily movements and vitakkavicāra about this or that; it should not be a *replacement* for that to any extent, in which case it automatically ceases to be *sati*. That's one of the main aspects where mainstream practices go astray.

### Why does HH and it's followers seem to be anti-meditation?

I am trying to understand if they are just critical of some types of meditation, or are against meditation practice as a whole.

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1djl80a/why_does_hh_and_its_followers_seem_to_be/l9f0qj5/)** _2024-06-20 04:27:20:

    It's not that we discourage "meditation" (if we define that as the practice of calming the mind) categorically before stream-entry. The point that in order to have any real chance of leading to the right view, such efforts need to be an *attempt to understand* what meditation is, whereas for most teachers and traditions meditation involves taking for granted one's current understanding of what the defilements are, how they need to be abandoned, and what the goal even is, and that's a big mistake. Therefore, no matter how many years of diligent effort and resulting insights and skills one acquires, one’s *fundamental view* has remained mostly unchanged, and that means one has hardly "moved" along the path at all. Attempting to practice meditation with the context that one still doesn't understand what meditation is what nobody wants to do—nobody wants to put in the work to really dial in their running form before they actually start packing on miles—but at the end of the day it's not optional unless you want to get injured (fall into wrong samādhi, wrong knowledge, and wrong liberation). A stream-enterer is one who [knows how to meditate properly](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an1.51-60#an1.51:1.1-an1.52:1.4) (and has [*acquired* the seven enlightenment factors](https://suttacentral.net/sn46.30/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin) and the [Noble Eightfold Path](https://suttacentral.net/sn55.5/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin)).

    The second element is that the Suttas always present meditation (abiding in seclusion in an attempt to abandon the five hindrances) as a very late stage for which certain prerequisites need to be fulfilled, and that's because it's simply a more refined and subtle development of the *same principle* as all the previous steps of the Gradual Training. So our point that people shouldn't even try to practice meditation unless they've fulfilled those previous steps is akin to saying that you shouldn't try to lift 100 pounds if you can't even lift 20 with good technique, and [should instead focus on mastering 10, then 20, etc.](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn107#mn107:2.1-mn107:2.12) (unless, again, you want to injure yourself).

    Even though many teachers do place emphasis on virtue and sense restraint, it's almost always as an *aid* to meditation, and in the final analysis the "meat" of the practice they teach is something that goes in a different direction altogether than the practice of restraint "off the cushion", no matter how much they may emphasize it. The fact that one could even *theoretically* succeed in such practices without being developed in the 8 precepts and sense restraint means it's not in line with what's taught in the Suttas. It means it’s a type of mental development that can coexist with the five hindrances, and at least from the Buddha's point of view such a thing cannot rightly be called meditation. In the same vein, meditation and the pursuit of sensual pleasures are in most traditions more like "north and west", whereas according to the Suttas [they're north and south](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an9.41#an9.41:7.1-an9.41:7.15), meaning they're mutually incompatible.

    Lastly, sometimes people think the critique is directed only at "pure samatha" practices, but such a thing does not even exist (Dhp 372, [AN 6.73](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an6.73#an6.73:1.4)), and the belief that it *could* in itself shows that one’s view of meditation is off even if one personally doesn't practice in that way.

    It seems like you're trying to rebut the point, but  the Sutta you quote actually supports it further.

    We all agree that purity of virtue is not the end goal. The point is that if someone rides the first chariot only halfway or 75% the way, whatever they hopped onto after that was not the second chariot they were actually meant to ride. And that's how it's regarded today generally: "just do your best with your virtue; at the end of the day the second and further chariots are available to you regardless".

    >(although this is also the description of the wakefulness/watchfulness step).

    Yes, that's what comes next. They would be having coarser manifestations of the five hindrances arising, e.g. *active* proliferation of thoughts about sensual pleasures and annoyances. So the task would be to not grasp those signs and features while they're presenting themselves, as described [here](https://www.hillsidehermitage.org/restraining-the-senses/).

    Once you become skilled at enduring those now mental signs and features without leaping on to them, i.e. you still have a hint of those images at the back of your mind but you're not "grabbing" them, just as you wouldn't grab something with your hand *while it's being offered to you*, and you have[ pervaded every moment of your day](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn107#mn107:7.1-mn107:7.2) with that kind of attitude, then you're in a position to address the five hindrances at their source.

    As AN 8.63 puts it: “When your mind is steady and well settled internally, and ***arisen*** bad, unskillful states don’t endure with a grip on your mind, then you should train like this: ‘I will develop the liberation of mind through friendliness. I’ll cultivate it, make it my vehicle and my basis, keep it up, consolidate it, and properly implement it.’ That’s how you should train.” (replace mettā with anything else from the Suttas).

    >Guarding the senses is so much of the path that it can be hard to differentiate it from the other steps, and this makes it all seem much less gradual.

    That's actually the very reason why it's a refinement of the same principle from beginning to end. At no point do you start doing "something else". Right sense restraint is [the source of peace](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.94/en/bodhi?lang=en).

### Precepts

[deleted]

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1diyxhp/precepts/l9aa9in/)** _2024-06-19 09:38:00:

    >Am I still making progress/merit by living this way? Is it possible to obtain right view without perfection of the precepts?

    You would make some progress and merit by taking on even one precept compared to none, but whether it's enough for the right view is a different question that cannot be answered except in hindsight, just like nobody can tell in advance whether cutting corners here and there in the construction of a building will still allow it to survive a future earthquake. All that can be said is that there are [guidelines](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn53#mn53:19.1-mn53:19.5) for proper construction laid down by experts, and that any deviation from that entails a gamble.

    Based on what you say, the main reason is not wanting to upset those around you, but it could be that that itself becomes an obstruction to stream entry although it's not as coarse as doing those acts out of pure individual desire (assuming you truly have 0 interest and passion for them internally, which is not a given). Even then, it would still very much partake in the five hindrances, and they are precisely what obstructs the realization of the Dhamma, perpetuating the wrong tacit assumption that unpleasant feeling (e.g., of others being upset with you owing to your practice) is suffering in itself.

### Questions on the yoniso manasikāra essay

>The puthujjana lacks even the correct understanding of what yoniso manasikāra is - ayoniso manasikāra is the very reason for his self-view.

>Before that \[attaining the right view\], the effort is to learn what yoniso manasikāra is, and keep taking one's present understanding of it with a pinch of salt.

>The goal of yoniso attention is to see that whole \_this\_, one's entire world, as within, as being fully dependent on, secondary to, simultaneously originated from (paṭiccasamuppanna) another \*this\*. This will automatically prevent you from assuming yourself as the origin, the owner, the master of this experience - of this attention. It will truly prevent assuming as yours anything that you can attend to.

I have read the essay several times. Yet, I am not sure I have understood it properly...

A) Can the practical instructions for the development of right mindfulness and attention given in the essays peripherical awareness and yoniso manasikaara be resumed as follows: *The anchor (as presented in the peripherical awareness essay) is the pivot post use to keep attention at the proper distance in order to see simultaneously the anchor, the experience, and the womb of the experience (those three elements remain ungrasped, not over attended, and so kind of unfocused)?*

B) In terms of the essays yoniso manasikaara and peripherical awareness, if the anchor were the breath and the womb the body: how one should understand and develop "sampajañña"?

C) When one has overattended an object, due to begin interested in it, then one has stepped into ayoniso attention. Once this is realized, should one trace back the sequence of attentions and experiences that leaded into this overattention, or just regain the yoniso attention and keep going?

D) As I understood, there are different layers and elements of ones experience, and thus different layers of wombs, some more general (that include all the experience), some more concrete (like a womb of one mental object of the whole experience).

>Now, the question arises: what exactly is that broader phenomenon that one must discern in regard to one's attention, so that attention itself will be seen as "not mine".

>The four satipaṭṭhānas are four general aspects that can be interchangeably discerned as the "womb" (yoni) or "container" of this experience as a whole, so that I can no longer assume that experience as within me. The most practical example would be in terms of the body.

In order to practice and develop yoniso, is it better to stick for long to one of the most generals wombs - the body - as a fixed context, or is it convenient to attend to a wider range of general-and-concrete wombs depending on what experience is going on?

pd: the footnote 11 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5\_57craC) is incorrect link

    >A) Can the practical instructions for the development of right mindfulness and attention given in the essays peripherical awareness and yoniso manasikaara be resumed as follows: *The anchor (as presented in the peripherical awareness essay) is the pivot post use to keep attention at the proper distance in order to see simultaneously the anchor, the experience, and the womb of the experience (those three elements remain ungrasped, not over attended, and so kind of unfocused)?*

    You're not trying to see three things simultaneously, nor even two. It's more like peripheral awareness allows you to see the full picture of your *one* present experience, and without it you would immediately become immersed in particular sense objects and preoccupations, and being immersed (*avijjā*) is the root of passion and aversion.

    >B) In terms of the essays yoniso manasikaara and peripherical awareness, if the anchor were the breath and the womb the body: how one should understand and develop "sampajañña"?

    "The anchor" and "the womb" are not two different things.

    >C) When one has overattended an object, due to begin interested in it, then one has stepped into ayoniso attention. Once this is realized, should one trace back the sequence of attentions and experiences that leaded into this overattention, or just regain the yoniso attention and keep going?

    Unequivocally the latter. You can’t "trace back the sequence of attentions" accurately even if you try because experience is not a sequence to begin with, and by such attempts you would be severely misconceiving it.

    It sounds like you're over-complicating and over-rationalizing it. Think about it like this:

    The whole reason why the metaphor of an "anchor" is used is because you're not supposed to be constantly attending to it. A fisherman isn’t holding the anchor *and* the fishing rod at the same time.

    When you initially go into seclusion, you think for a moment about whichever context you feel inclined to use that day. Let’s say you're choose to be mindful of your posture. So you have to actually *attend* to the fact that you’re walking and clearly recognize that that is the background of your experience for this duration of time whether or not you think about it. That's setting up the anchor. Then you let your mind think about whatever—the fisherman forgets about the anchor, but obviously the anchor is still there. No matter how deeply you go into your thoughts, you have at least a tiny 1% of the recognition that you *are* walking while you’re thinking, and that recognition doesn't require active maintenance. You *have* to stop actively holding on to the anchor for it to actually do its job.

    At some point however, you will all of a sudden realize that you completely forgot about the fact that you were walking and lost even that 1% recognition, the anchor. ***Then*** you set it up again, and let it drift into the background once more ... until at some point the same thing happens. That’s all.

    And there’s a reason why virtue and withdrawal from sensuality need to be established as your default state *before* you even try to practice this. That will ensure that you can actually let your mind roam around within the anchor for a while without it instantaneously jumping back to sensuality and ill will, as it otherwise would. That's why the satipaṭṭhāna stock passage always says “\[he practices like this\] ***having subdued*** longing and upset in regard to the world”. Suttas like AN 8.63 and SN 46.6 point out that your mind needs to be "steadied internally" (as a result of virtue and sense restraint) *before* you engage in any mindfulness practice, not the other way around as people usually take it (which is where "concentration" comes in—a contrived artifice to work around the prerequisites not being met).

    Another way of looking at it that would be more palpably connected to the abandoning of defilements what's described in [SN 35.246](http://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=sn35.246), but the principle is exactly same. The caretake beats the ox *when it wanders into the crops*, not constantly. 

    Edit: (And just to repeat, forget about trying to "catch" the moment when you lost the anchor. It simply doesn't work like that; the realization that you lost it will always come out of the blue, and you won't be able to remember how long you've been unmindful for. That would require you to have a point of view that exists outside of your five aggregates, and that's impossible even for an Arahant).

    In itself it wouldn’t be of much significance: right mindfulness does not exist without right view. But by attempting to practice such recollections (having covered the necessary prerequisites) while also making an effort to understand why they’re wholesome and lead to the ending of craving—which requires admitting to oneself that one still doesn’t understand—one could get closer to the right view.

    Nevertheless, even in completely mundane terms, peripheral awareness is what *sati* is, and that’s why some people innately possess that faculty more than others (who operate almost like animals, entirely taken by whatever they’re attending to at any given time). But what would in the example I gave be regarded as *sati* by Buddhists nowadays—intense observation of the minute sensations of walking—is an entirely artificial construct, and nobody would do it unless they were told to.

    >So! - Would checking on the intentions behind one's actions ("Why am I doing this?" ) actually be just another way of SETTING UP the anchor (establishing the context of the currently enduring mood/feeling) and then letting it fade into the background ... until you check again?

    Indeed. An intention would only be known as wholesome or unwholesome due to it's relation with the present mood/feeling, and intentions can never be exerted by accident. So all you need to do in order not to act out of a feeling is to be peripherally aware of it "on the right level". Conversely, not acting out of it for a while makes it even more effortless to not lose sight of it, and it becomes a virtuous circle. And that's essentially what samādhi is: peripheral awareness of the enduring feeling being so effortless and ingrained that acting "out" of it—literally, assuming that you can get "outside" of it—is entirely inconceivable, and thus any suffering or discomfort born of assuming you *could* get outside is gone. Hence the relinquishing of a debt or burden as the Suttas describe it.

    >2. So overall, it's about getting the right "tune" over and over again, no? When it's too tight (self mortification, one is trying to get RID of the enduring feeling or pressure), you stop making it too tight. When it's too loose (acting out), you stop that. But if it's neither, you don't have to do anything (like one doesn't have to beat the ox just for the sake of it?)

    Yes.

### Extent of precepts leading to sense restraint

In the comments on a [recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1d32drw/sense_restraint_how_hard_to_push_what_about_when/), u/Bhikkhu_Anigha wrote:

>Unless you see no further work to do in regard to the 8 precepts, you shouldn't be worrying about sense restraint to begin with.

Can you clarify what the extent of the 8 precepts that needs to be fulfilled is that would "make it worthwhile" to think about how to and apply sense restraint.

Does that extent include bodily and verbal domains? Or is being unable to refrain from engaging with any sensual thought ("finding myself" thinking/fantasizing but not  to the point of considering bodily acts) without fail a breach of the precepts? As I understand, this is the point where the welcoming, delighting etc. could be recognized and while not thinking I am doing it rightly at least be able to try to find the balance between accepting the pull/aversion and trying to deny/remove it.

[SN 35.98](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.98/en/bodhi?lang=en&reference=none&highlight=false):

>And how, bhikkhus, is there restraint? There are, bhikkhus, forms cognizable by the eye that are desirable, lovely, agreeable, pleasing, sensually enticing, tantalizing. If a bhikkhu does not seek delight in them, does not welcome them, and does not remain holding to them, he should understand this thus: ‘I am not declining away from wholesome states. For this has been called nondecline by the Blessed One.’

Or does understanding "I am not declining away from wholesome" imply that one needs right view to be able to apply (or try to understand) any of this?

    >Can you clarify what the extent of the 8 precepts that needs to be fulfilled is that would "make it worthwhile" to think about how to and apply sense restraint.

    Simply that occasions where you break them are exceptions rather than the norm, and you no longer feel like you're constantly on the verge of succumbing to the pull on the bodily and verbal level as you would have initially.

    As I mentioned in another post as well, in the beginning there's no problem with "blindly" avoiding seeing or hearing things if it helps you keep the precepts. It's just that one shouldn't fall into a view that that alone is sense restraint, which does require understanding (awareness of the present mental state and how what you choose to deliberately attend to or engage with will influence it).

    >and seeing this activity as something relaxing that I "need" after a lot of work.

    You probably need to check what attitudes you're cultivating  and what sort of environment you find yourself in while you're working. It sounds like your mind has already been inclining in the direction of the unwholesome during that time, and so you end up with a runaway train by the end of it. The pull towards unwholesome actions can only be that strong if you've already been doing other unwholesome actions beforehand, even mentally.

### Signs and features & hints of the mind

Hello, could you help me shed some light on this please: are the "signs and features" and "hints/signs of the mind" totally different things that should not be put in the same bag or are they two sides of the same coin?

As I understand it, the "signs and features" are associated with perception:

>The signs and features of a thing are not just the particular sensory perceptions of it (shape, color, texture, etc.), but also the entire “world” of significances, feelings, memories, associations, ideas, and intentions associated with it

>-- [Restraining the senses (from Bhikkhu Anigha)](https://www.hillsidehermitage.org/restraining-the-senses/)

But I understand the "hints/signs of the mind" as rather associated with the state of mind, as what is giving away the current state of mind: a certain inclination towards certain types of thought, the speed and flow of these thoughts, even certain types of perceptions/feelings that are usually connected with a certain state of mind, the type of pressure and towards what it is pressuring me,  ..

But I also think that the definition of the former, namely `[the signs and features are] also the entire “world” of significances, feelings, memories, associations, ideas, and intentions associated with it` could be used in regard to the state of mind, in the sense that with a certain state of mind enduring there will be a certain feeling that will be more often present than another, certain memories/associations/ideas/intentions that will be more proeminent than others; or in other words: with a certain state of mind enduring, the mind as the tendency to grasp at certains signs and features rather than others.

How should it be understood?

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1dfnthv/signs_and_features_hints_of_the_mind/l8l0s33/)** _2024-06-14 14:18:40:

    They're the same in principle, just that one grasping of signs has to stop and the other has to begin (and the stopping of the former is what allows the starting of the latter).

    When an unrestrained person perceives something they have strong lust or aversion for, their experience is overtaken by the significances and further characteristics and features related to that thing (what they would like to do with it, fantasies, etc.) Conversely, when someone tries to put their finger on what their mind actually is in the present experence—i.e., concretely and not in theory—there is either a total barrenness and lack of clarity, or abstract ideas that totally miss the mark. There are no “tokens” or characteristics they’re aware of by which they could confidently and without doubt say “this is how my mind is disposed at this moment”. Or, when they think they’re seeing the characteristics of their mind they actually aren’t, and are instead looking at secondary thoughts and sense objects.

    And [these](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn10#mn10:34.1-mn10:34.17) are the ways the mind can be disposed—it's as simple as that. Any more detailed or intricate theoretical explanations would correspond to sense objects and ideas, not to the mind that is present “behind” them there and then. “Grasping” those signs means knowing the indirect characteristics that would define a mind as passionate, averse, etc., and no longer mistakenly relying on the particular content of experience to determine that.

    For example, whoever doesn’t see the signs of their mind would tacitly assume that the presence of disagreeability and negative thoughts is what a hateful mind is. The actual hateful mind is something much subtler that is *peripheral to that* and endures simultaneously, which is why the starting point must be to not act out of aversion, and endure the lingering displeasure without suppressing it with “loving-kindness” mantras and so on.

### question about withdrawal from sensuality

So let me get this straight, when I try my best to avoid welcoming sensuality, and certain perceptions come and torment me, that is not some "energy" that is building up and that I need to release in some way, but rather the extent of infestation of my own addiction to sensuality, right? Sort of like the tide going away and revealing all the things that were underneath, the depravations, the strange beliefs, the neurotic compulsions. All the things that lived rent-free because of my addiction and gratifying of sensuality that made me unaware to them, numb to them. Am I on the right track here?

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1ddj3o1/question_about_withdrawal_from_sensuality/l88w6lr/)** _2024-06-12 09:48:45:

    Right, and it's also important to realize that the "addiction "to sensuality is not a purely bodily affair, unlike a drug addiction. The problem is not limited to the mere arising of sensual bodily urges, for otherwise getting old (or even just living in a remote forest for the rest of one's life) would automatically diminish the addiction.

    The core of sensuality is *mentally valuing* the pleasure that is offered to your senses, which means that once you get old and the "weight" of sensual pleasure ceases to even be cognized, it actually becomes much harder, not easier, to train your mind to overcome the addiction properly. It's much easier to ignore your liability to it and pretend like you're more equanimous just because the triggers of sensual craving no longer arise as intensely.

    But the good news is that mentally valuing sensual pleasure is completely up to you, and it's a choice that you can learn to refrain from making on sequentially more refined levels (which is what the Gradual Training is about).

    >is that better than not practicing at all? Or are you wasting your time?

    It's impossible for restraint and renunciation to be a waste of time, even if one does not reach enlightenment nor hope to do so. It's like a fire: not being able to put it out completely still doesn't justify intentionally giving it more fuel.

    Still, even such a person could theoretically understand the Dhamma if they make enough effort. The fact that they would still be very happy to have their sight back is not in itself a problem (it could be considered a fetter subtler than that of sensuality and aversion). But if they crave to have their old *indulgences* back, don't even see that attitude as a defilement, and blindly welcome it, then that person is not really "practicing" (and with that mindset they would surely be finding their new share of sensual gratification elsewhere anyway).

    Abstinence only counts as virtue when one has the ability to indulge but willingly refrains from doing so (even delighting by mind). That person would still have the ability to indulge in sense pleasures with the other five senses, and restraint there is what would count towards their virtue and taming of mind.

    From here onward I would change it to "because we don't experientially see the excrement buried within the chocolate even when we've been told and/or rationally come to the conclusion that it's there". That's why even though a lot of people and philosophers recognize the folly of sensual pursuits, in the end it usually makes little to no difference to their concrete actions. And you get to "see it" (since it was always already there) by repeatedly curbing your bodily, verbal, and mental actions using your faith and reasoning that the excrement is there: remembering and restraining.

    >So in other words, our very perception is rigged?

    Right, but it's not like it's hopeless. As I wrote, giving up the actions that the perverted perception is inclining you towards (even by mind) is what gradually beings to allow for correcting the mistake of perception. If the leper stops scratching and cauterizing the scabs of his wounds, he at least stands a chance of undermining his wrong perception of that pain as pleasant.

### Is Craving a Dhamma?

Trying to understand what 'Dhamma' (when translated as 'phenomena') actually means. What's the necessary condition for something to be called a Dhamma? 

Is Craving (Tanha) a Dhamma? What about Ignorance (avijja)? Are the five aggregates five different Dhammas? What about clinging with respect to the aggregates? Is that a Dhamma too? Or are there five different clinging Dhammas, one for each aggregate?

Thanks.

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1db066g/is_craving_a_dhamma/l7rvdvr/)** _2024-06-09 04:43:26:

    >What's the necessary condition for something to be called a Dhamma?

    The ability to be called *something* (i.e., the fact that it is manifest in any shape or form). In other words, saying that something cannot be called a Dhamma is a contradiction in terms: you are then and there designating it in that way, which means the thing is manifest in your experience to that extent.

    Having said that, it's true that people's definition or conception of what dhammas or phenomena are is generally quite deficient. The natural tendency is to think in terms of *sense* *objects*, and whatever cannot be directly observed in that way would tend to be dismissed and regarded as not real, or as abstract at the very least (and that often serves as a shortcut towards *anattā*: the self is supposedly "not real" just because it cannot be seen the way a chair can). 

    But things like craving, ignorance, and the five aggregates are most certainly not sense objects, and yet they're also perfectly concrete and presently knowable if one learns to see them for what they are, in their "indirectness", which is the only way they can arise. Making them "more palpable" through direct attention makes them cease to be what they were.

    To use one of Ajahn Nyanamoli's similes, it's like stars on a clear night sky that you can only see when you're looking at *other* stars. Once you try to look at them directly, they disappear. You wouldn't say that those stars that can only be seen with your peripheral vision "don't exist"; they are dhammas that manifest *as peripheral.*

    [This talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yptLIdi1JW8) is quite relevant to this topic.

### “Rebirth by choice”? 



I’m curious if you have given any thought to aspiring to “this or that” rebirth? I know other traditions emphasize this more but I’d like to hear what this sub thinks about it. 

Speaking for myself, I have so far figured that it doesn’t really matter what realm I aspire towards — in other words, I’ll just let my kamma take me wherever it “has to” take me. While trusting that keeping a solid morality will have good results. 

But then I came across the sutta below, which made me think that perhaps I should give this more thought. I may not reach Nibbana in this life, so maybe it’s wise to think about where I would prefer to go next. (Though I’m not very familiar with all these strange realms the suttas speak of!) 

What about you, do you have any thoughts on this?  

Best wishes,

-

Excerpt from “Rebirth by Choice”, MN 120 
translated by Bhikkhu Sujato ; 

”At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, “Mendicants!”

“Venerable sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this:

“I shall teach you rebirth by choice. Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”

“Yes, sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this:

“Take a mendicant who has faith, ethics, learning, generosity, and wisdom. They think: ‘If only, when my body breaks up, after death, I would be reborn in the company of well-to-do aristocrats!’ They settle on that thought, stabilize it and develop it. Those choices and meditations of theirs, developed and cultivated like this, lead to rebirth there. This is the path and the practice that leads to rebirth there.

Furthermore, take a mendicant who has faith, ethics, learning, generosity, and wisdom. They think: ‘If only, when my body breaks up, after death, I would be reborn in the company of well-to-do brahmins … well-to-do householders.’ They settle on that thought, stabilize it and develop it. Those choices and meditations of theirs, developed and cultivated like this, lead to rebirth there. This is the path and the practice that leads to rebirth there.

Furthermore, take a mendicant who has faith, ethics, learning, generosity, and wisdom. And they’ve heard: ‘The Gods of the Four Great Kings are long-lived, beautiful, and very happy.’ They think: ‘If only, when my body breaks up, after death, I would be reborn in the company of the Gods of the Four Great Kings!’ They settle on that thought, stabilize it and develop it. Those choices and meditations of theirs, developed and cultivated like this, lead to rebirth there. This is the path and the practice that leads to rebirth there.” 

…. then it goes on like this through the rest of the Brahma realms, and all the way to Nibbana. 


- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1d8x7rc/rebirth_by_choice/l7h1ukz/)** _2024-06-07 02:51:06:

    Firstly, it should be noted that "choices", "thought", and "meditation" here are misleading translations. The first is *saṅkhāra*, which is more like intention or even "inclination" in this context. The second is *citta*, which is something that arises of its own accord and you cannot directly fabricate unlike a thought (*vitakka*), and the third is *vihāra*, which simply means "abiding", not "meditation". Also, the phrasing "They think: ‘If only...’" makes it sound like it's something he's intentionally choosing to bring to mind, but the Pāli is "tassa evaṃ hoti", which simply means "For him there is thus:".

    Paired with the statement, that faith, virtue, learning, generosity (or more like relinquishment, *cāga,* since it's a bhikkhu), and especially understanding are necessary, this changes the picture significantly. It means that one must develop one's mind (citta) to the point where it would factually on its own incline in that direction and possess the characteristics defining that rebirth, and *then* cultivate further resolve and determination towards that ("taṃ cittaṃ dahati, taṃ cittaṃ adhiṭṭhāti, taṃ cittaṃ bhāveti").

    Furthermore, one will most likely never reach the necessary level of these wholesome qualities if from the start one delights in rebirth. [MN 16](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn16) states:

    >When a bhikkhu has not given up these five obstinacies and cut off these five shackles of mind, **it’s not possible for him to achieve growth, improvement, or maturity in this teaching and discipline.**

    >...

    >He leads the renunciate life for the sake of a certain heavenly existence, thinking: ‘By this precept or observance or fervent austerity or renunciate life, may I become one of the gods!’ This being so, his mind doesn’t incline to diligence, dedication, persistence, and striving. This is the fifth shackle of mind he hasn’t cut off. These are the five shackles of mind he hasn’t cut off.

    So the scenario being described here is not that of an ordinary beginner who simply decides they want to be reborn in such and such realm and magically ends up realizing that aspiration. It's someone who got to the point where they are at (sotāpatti) by *not* delighting in being and pleasure of any kind and cultivating dispassion, but for one reason or another did not make it all the way to Arahantship, and by cultivating such determinations they would ensure that they, so to speak, reap no less than what they sowed (which could happen). It won't magically lead to results that they hadn't already earned.

    And even in the case of householders in the Suttas who managed to reach such a level of development, it was *through* dispassion and relinquishment. It's only afterwards that they often became complacent with that they had attained.

    >(1) Then the Buddha taught the householder Upāli step by step, with a talk on generosity, virtue, and heaven. (2) **He explained the woe, inferiority, and defilement of sensuality, and the benefit of renunciation**. (i.e. dispassion towards even the lofty realms)  
    (3) And when he knew that Upāli’s mind was ready, pliable, rid of hindrances, elated, and confident he explained the special teaching of the Buddhas: suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path. Just as a clean cloth rid of stains would properly absorb dye, in that very seat the stainless, immaculate eye of the Dhamma arose in Upāli: “Whatever has the nature of arising has the nature of ceasing.” Then Upāli saw, attained, understood, and fathomed the Dhamma. He went beyond doubt, got rid of indecision, and became self-assured and independent of others regarding the Teacher’s instructions.

    >“Well, Bhante, now I must go. I have many duties, and much to do.”

    —[MN 56](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn56)

    Ideally, but not necessarily. A monk who becomes satisfied with his current attainments and is looking forward to a certain rebirth would recognize that he has far greater chances of actually getting there if he remains a monk. So even if pleasure is one's ultimate goal, the more renunciation in this life one can do, the better ([see Udāna 3.2](https://suttacentral.net/ud3.2/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin)). Any benefit lay life and material pursuits may provide is totally transient and limited to this life, and thus hardly a true benefit in the grand scheme of things.

    But, again, holding such aspirations and progressing further on the path are mutually exclusive. As shown in that Sutta, Venerable Nanda was able to really take on the practice only when he gave up that wish out of a sense of shame.

### Why is the joy of relief absent?

I’ve been keeping the precepts, practicing contentment with little, not delighting in company, dwelling alone the majority of the time. There aren’t many actions anymore either, by body or speech, as I’ve seen so many are rooted in unwholesome intentions or distraction. I’ve been reading and rereading suttas and the essays and they are straightforward, directly applicable to me.

But I feel something is *off.* I’m sleeping more, no doubt because of having little to *do.* I wonder if this is more of a depression, a nagging doubt fuelled by those I do see wondering why I’m not engaging in idle conversation anymore or sensual activities. It‘s like there is no interest in a vast amount of what previously occupied my day. So I’m just here with this pressure and discerning more and more subtle ways in which I’m ignoring it or trying to get rid of it, and it honestly feels like dying. Is this the practice? Do I just keep enduring this? 

And this may sound strange, but have I somehow obscured the place where the joy of renunciation *is?* There is clearly a sense of self that is maintained in the suttas, of mind, whatever you want to call it, a place that becomes free, experiences the relief of cessation, but I don’t *know* it? This is quite a bizarre predicament I find myself in. Everything is just very unevolving, I guess you could describe it, but it’s not pleasant - and that’s why there is this doubt I can’t shake and I’ve made this post.

Thank you in advance to anyone who makes a comment. This may be something one can only figure out for oneself directly, but perhaps there are others who have known something similar and can help.  


- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1d8v4a6/why_is_the_joy_of_relief_absent/l7h47td/)** _2024-06-07 03:08:44:

    It's hard to judge solely based on what you wrote, but it could simply be that your very expectation that there should be pleasure is the reason why you're uneasy. The "relief" that you refer to is the relief of the absence of craving, and if you're looking forward to "something else" apart from what you have present, it means you're resisting the present feeling, and that's exactly what craving is.

    Of course, I'm not here endorsing the whole new-age "just be with the moment and give up all expectations" mumbo jumbo. What I'm saying is that once you have developed yourself in virtue and restraint, you need to start realizing that the suffering that's left there is due to your own out-of-tune attitude towards your own thoughts and mental states, that is either too lax (too indulgent and careless) or too tight (overly denying), and that's when you start overcoming the five hindrances correctly (which includes anticipation and expectation of any kind).

    If you try to give up these (at the time) subtler things *before* you're established in wholesome behavior, however, you will be disposing of the very drive that's meant to get you to where you need to be. Once you're there, though, you need to start distinguishing those (now) coarser, initially beneficial pressures as something that you shouldn't give in to, *without* allowing that to take you all the way back into indulgence and non-restraint.

    It's also important to see that any expectation of pleasure whatsoever falls within the first hindrance. Any pleasure that is actually wholesome and in line with the noble truths would come from ceasing to care about the fact that there is no pleasure (and this is compared to paying off a debt in the Suttas, the debt being of course created and maintained by one's own present passion towards *anything*, not just coarse sensual objects externally). 

    If it's a pleasure that can be sought or produced directly, it will be sensual whether one likes it or not. It will be the pleasure of creating a new feeling however subtly, not the pleasure of abandoning craving, thus going with the grain of the same old ignorance about what the cause of all uneasiness actually is.

    >The five hindrances really are on the level of being

    And that's why it's such a mistake to underestimate their sheer scope.

    >Dispassion in regard to *all*… including whatever can be cognised? ...  
    So if you seek the pleasure of nibbana, you mistakenly construe it like everything else, and you’ll never encounter it?

    Basically, yes. You still strive towards Nibbāna one way or another, but seeking it in the form of *pleasure* means falling away from the very attitude that defines Nibbāna: dispassion.

    In general, any pleasure that requires you to compromise the recognition of the extent of the All (yoniso manasikāra) and non-delight in that is necessarily unwholesome, even if it seems "harmless" in comparison with external sensuality. Passion, aversion, and distraction are there exactly to the extent that there is *avijjā*—lack of clarity, you could say—and those 3 things *are* what harm is.

    So it's not like you can put side the aspect of phenomenological clarity in order to develop joy, and then "return" to wisdom later, as it's often assumed. Falling off of phenomenological clarity means falling off right view and the Dhamma altogether, and the fruits of that cannot magically feed into the eightfold path which is fully predicated on right view. Hence it's said that there is no jhāna without understanding, and vice versa (Dhp 372).

    >Unless you understand nibbana as what wells up naturally, non-dependently… and that’s why it can’t be however you construe it to be? And that’s why it’s a true refuge?

    It doesn't "well up naturally"; totally mundane experiences that people would tend to aggrandize can also do that, and with little to no renunciation and understanding/right view developed beforehand.

    Nibbāna is the perpetually present structural possibility for dispassion that needs to be *understood.* And it's available because craving can never possibly be *in* your feelings and experiences; rather, it's there exactly to the extent that you don't understand it's redundancy, no more and no less. Nibbāna is a true refuge because it depends 0% on *what* feelings and experiences have arisen and does not require you to manage or interfere with that domain (a task that always risks failure). It only requires you to have become established in restraint beforehand to create the opening to discern it, but proper restraint is the opposite of management.

    >The scope seems huge when you say *anything* but if anything is dependent on this one thing - the body - then I can see the way for dispassion to have equal scope.

    Yes, that's one way of putting it. It doesn't matter how vast the "size" of passion or the pressure towards it gets, the possibility of dispassion always remains structurally present because the body will always be the foundation for whatever arises, and seeing that dependence rightly is enough for the mind to stay fully disconnected from passion.

    >Would it also be fair to say then that by extension, wanting to get rid of ANY displeasure AT ALL counts as within the hindrance of ill will (wanting to get rid of the pressure/discomfort/displeasure of arisen regret/anger/boredom)?

    In the final analysis, yes. Any intention that resists the arisen feeling is an intention with craving. But initially, wanting to get rid of displeasure is what motivates you to take on the practice in the first place (not seeing that displeasure and suffering are actually two different things, you inevitably think destroying the latter requires eliminating the former). As understanding develops, you begin to realize that the desire to "resolve" *any displeasure whatsoever* is actually precisely the reason you suffer, and *then* you begin striving to abandon that. That's what's meant in the Suttas when it's said that craving is necessary to set you on the path to abandoning craving (it doesn't mean you abandon craving "with" craving as people would sometimes think: what that really is is feeding one hindrance while starving another).

    >I don't really understand what is meant by the 5 hindrances being on the level of "being"...

    It means that it's impossible to overcome them through any kind of practice that is "selective" (e.g. focusing on the breath, arousing pleasant thoughts, or even mechanically contemplating things actually found in the Suttas), leaving the other parts or your experience out or taking them for granted (background intentions especially), because *that* will automatically become the "place" where the hindrances "move" to— just as darkness is automatically at whatever spot you're not pointing a flashlight to. You don't need to consciously "put" the darkness anywhere; all that's required is the absence of light (and that's why the Buddha always compared *avijjā* with darkness).

### Pressure, craving, acting out of mind

To the question:

>Does that mean that when there is the sense of ownership, phassa entails cravings by default?

Bhante Anigha [answered](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/196a1us/comment/kht955q/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button):

>Yes. If there *were* no craving to *act* out of the pressure, you couldn't call it "pressure" or even "contact" anymore. In order for it to qualify as "pressure" in the first place, there needs to be craving in response to it, on account of a misguided ownership of things that arise on their own (ignorance).

>So it goes both ways, pressure is determined as what it is by craving (which is always *already there*, 24/7; [it doesn't "arise" at some mysterious point](https://suttacentral.net/an10.62/en/bodhi?lang=en&reference=none&highlight=false)), and conversely, craving could never be there if there were no pressure.

Does that mean that if someone is pressured but is capable of never acting out on the level of body or speech, he is nevertheless still acting out on the level of the mind, grasping at signs and features of perceptions that are connected to unwholesome states, and if he wasn't there wouldn't be any pressure with phassa/contact? (Or there wouldn't even be contact anymore?)

Or is acting out on the level of the mind something else?

I understand it as an intermediate stage that a trainee needs to go through, after being firmly established in virtue, in order to purify even the acting out on the level of the mind by essentially "keeping the guard post" as the simile goes, making the effort to not grasp at signs that are connected to unwholesome states and making the effort to attend to differents signs connected to wholesome states when one find itself already doing the former.

And because of that, by stopping to fuel the craving, and also by establishing a more and more persistent non-ignorant context that the problem isn't the feeling but the 'wanting more/less' of this feeling (that the feeling is a structural part of the experience where the 'wanting more/less' is added on top of it, unneccessary and above all, the source of these troubles), pressure will eventually not arise anymore.

Is this understanding correct?

    No, craving is not the same as grasping at signs and features (mental action). Actions rooted in passion, aversion, and distraction (hindrances) are what *fuels* craving (i.e., the pressure to perform more of such actions).

    You can successfully stop acting unwholesomely on all three levels at any given moment if you understand how to do so (which requires yoniso manasikāra, and of course prior development in virtue), but craving—which is a broad phenomenon, much more general than this or that thing you desire or hate—would only dissipate (temporarily even, as in samādhi) as a result of *sustaining* that restraint on all three levels of action long enough.

### Help me understand the phenomenology of wanting unpleasant feelings (contains self-harming)

From my understanding, if something is unpleasant, there is always a wanting to get rid of it. If something is pleasant, there is always a wanting to obtain it. Even if you have someone who says "no, I like being depressed, I feel comfortable in this emotion, it's all I've ever known" then *that* right there is a pleasant feeling that is wanted, or rather, the idea of being content provokes a feeling of uncertainty which is unpleasant and there is craving to get away from it. So from what I understand, unpleasant feeling exists on a scale, and less-unpleasant feelings are deemed desirable, or 'pleasant', and if one does not know this properly, you can easily get confused thinking you sometimes want unpleasant feeling which can only be a contradiction.

So something awfully bad happened to me the other night and I ended up self-harming. I haven't done this in 3 years, had no urge or interest in it that entire time, but due to a severe lack of sleep + unfortunate life event, I hit my threshold and to my utter surprise cut myself. I remember when I did it historically, it was very pleasant, and I was actually annoyed that the urge to do it vanished. I've woken up today completely tilted because I don't have the urge to self-harm, I'm annoyed it was a one-off. I seem to want the unpleasant feeling but I know this can't be the case...

What I can say is that in the past, I only self-harmed when things were incredibly bad, that made self-harming 'worth' it. It had to be serious enough. SH used to trigger feelings of comfort, self-care, validation, sense of control, a reliable escape. However, I could not, and cannot SH over something little or even mid, now THAT would be unpleasant. It would NOT cause feelings of comfort, self-care, validation and so on. If I were to do it now for no good reason, I would actually feel deflated, icky, stupid, ridiculous, silly, kind of like 'bruh wtf am I doing this for'.

So the only thing I can think of, is that historically I still very much delighted in the prospect of SHing, which means the unpleasant feeling was there, but because my mood was nowhere near bad enough, I know I couldn't do it without it causing feelings of shame. There seems to be a value judgement - I feel low and want to SH, but the idea of SHing whilst simply feeling low would make me feel even worse and I don't want that. In the past, there was a 'hope' of even worse things happening to me so I had an 'excuse' to have the urge to SH, which makes me believe the urge was already there from the start, just incredibly subtle... and me welcoming bad life events was the delighting in freedom from that unpleasant urge.

So ultimately what I believe is "me wanting unpleasant feelings" is actually just another case of me not wanting higher degrees of unpleasant feeling.

In the video "Why did the buddha say sensuality to be an assumption" Nyanamoli Thero mentioned how the idea of getting your desires met to avoid the future pain of not having them met, can only ever be done on the basis of already being subjected to the desire first. So from my understanding I cannot 'want' the 'wanting' to SH unless I subtly already want to SH in the first place.

And I just want to repeat that in those 3 years of not doing it, the "wanting of the wanting to SH" vanished, and I simply didn't think about it the whole time. From my understanding there was therefore truly no interest in doing it.

(I'm fine btw)

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1d5pzsc/help_me_understand_the_phenomenology_of_wanting/l6qb9w3/)** _2024-06-02 05:37:17:

    >So ultimately what I believe is "me wanting unpleasant feelings" is actually just another case of me not wanting higher degrees of unpleasant feeling.

    Yes, it doesn't really matter that from a "public" point of view, self-harm should actually be unpleasant. What matters is that it does (or can) arise as pleasant *for you*. So it's not necessary to look at it in the context of *what* specifically your mind wants you to do in response to displeasure; what must be overcome is the common thread of inclining towards whatever actions give rise to pleasure *for you* in hopes of replacing or subduing the displeasure of things that are unpleasant *for you*. Phenomenologically speaking (which is all that matters in the context of the Dhamma), *why* something is pleasant or pleasant is irrelevant.

    >In the same way, bhikkhus, an unlearned ordinary person, when struck by unpleasant feeling, sorrows, wails, laments, beats their breast and becomes muddled. They feel two feelings: one bodily and one pertaining to the *citta*.

    >Struck by that same unpleasant feeling, they resist it. Thus, the underlying tendency to resistance against unpleasant feeling underlies them.

    >Struck by unpleasant feeling, they delight in the pleasure of sensuality. Why is that? Because, bhikkhus, an unlearned ordinary person doesn’t understand any escape from unpleasant feeling apart from the pleasure of sensuality. Since they delight in the pleasure of sensuality, the underlying tendency to passion for pleasant feeling underlies them.

    —SN 36.6

    You can overcome this tendency for self-harm by "managing" it (e.g., psychotherapy and so on), but what will actually destroy it at its root it is to train yourself in the precepts and restraining all the *other* unwholesome actions by body and speech rooted in seeking that same kind of escape (and which a mental health professional wouldn't normally regard as a problem even though they're perpetuating the exact same "illness").

    >that my experience of "wanting" an unpleasant urge so I can use self-harming to escape it, is only possible if I already have the subtle urge to SH in the first place?

    Yes, it would mean that at that moment you're already feeling displeasure and are delighting in the prospect of escaping it, but it's just not unpleasant enough. The arisen displeasure is always what defines the magnitude of relief that one gets from sensual pleasure, and if there were no displeasure, indulgence would become redundant. And even though in the case of the "traditional" sensual pleasures the objects in the world remain as pleasant as they have always been—that was never the root of sensuality.

    So more generally than this specific urge, you can look at the fact that you're already experiencing subtle displeasure and there is the craving to escape it through external means. Craving is never particular; it by definition can latch on to anything and still remain fundamentally the same craving (it "delights here and there" as said in the Suttas). So whether the offered escape is self harm or anything else is secondary to the presence of craving, i.e., resistance to displeasure.

### What is wakefulness ?

Often in sutta we encounter the adjective "wakeful" and I wondered how we should understand it since sampajanna covers awareness (reflexive attitude) and sati recollectedness ? Is it an incentive to not be lethargic or to not oversleep or is it pointing at a deeper meaning. ?

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1d473w0/what_is_wakefulness/l6favr6/)** _2024-05-31 03:15:14:

    The Pāli word being translated as "wakefulness" is *jāgariya,* and it doesn't just mean being awake but also being vigilant or on guard.

    So yes, not being lethargic and lazy (which is an optional mental choice no matter how physically tired you are) would be part of it, but it also means not neglecting the task of keeping your mind free of unwholesome states in general. Unwholesome states never exist on their own or by accident; they can arise only when they're allowed to pass through the gateway of volition (i.e., welcoming and entertaining arisen inclinations) and thus one should remain guarding that gateway vigilantly day and night.

### The Digha difference 

Been spending some time in the Digha recently and besides the obvious difference in length I’ve noticed a few other things. How are the descriptions of previous Buddhas and the markings of a Buddha significant in realizing right view? We don’t seem to touch upon these things in the Hillside community or very rarely. 

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1d3fky3/the_digha_difference/l6gtvu0/)** _2024-05-31 12:28:04:

    It's not that those parts are significant in realizing right view, but that being able to fit those paradigms that already existed in society probably was probably useful in getting a lot of people to pay more attention to the message.

    Now, that's not on the same level as when the Suttas talk about rebirth, recollecting one's own past lives, and the existence of beings in other realms. It's not necessary to place emphasis on that in the beginning to gain the right view, but it cannot be dismissed as mere literary embellishment.

### Question : Unyoked from biology

I have a question about Bhikkhu Anigha's latest post titled "Unyoked from biology" on the HH website. 

Venerable Anigha, would you mind explaining in other words or in more detail the part where you say that seeing rebirth is about discerning that our choices are not the same as the body? Isn't this capacity to choose the same as the aggregate of Sankhara? 

Even though we experience it (citta/sankhara) as being separate from things appearing or manifesting, how can we be so sure it must predate this body? Maybe both are possible? It appeared in this life but we are not fettered by it for as long as we live? 

Also looking at the citta in this way, doesn't it sound like it is that citta that "roams around and experiences the result of good and bad actions"? Precisely what the Bhikkhu Sati believed? Just replacing the word consciousness with citta? Citta is often used as a synonym for consciousness in many modern theravada circles.

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1d3dk4i/question_unyoked_from_biology/l6c5o9t/)** _2024-05-30 15:31:32:

    >Isn't this capacity to choose the same as the aggregate of Sankhara?

    Yes and no. The citta is the reflexive or "second-order" aspect of experience. It's the perceptions in regard to what is perceived, the feeling in regard to what is felt ([of which there is always only one at any given time](https://suttacentral.net/mn74/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin)), intentions in regard to intentions—and of course a second layer of consciousness that cognizes this second layer of *nāmarūpa*. But the essay focuses on the aspect of intentions which is arguably the most central.

    To illustrate with a very crude example, a mug arises on its own as either "for drinking" or "for storing pens", and these are first-order saṅkhāras. The second-order saṅkhāra there would be the intentional choice to use the up for one purpose and not the other. And it's on that first layer that you find what I refer to throughout the essay as "biological drives" (the intention of "for eating" in relation to food arises more strongly the hungrier you are). But no amount of intentions in the first layer can induce an act of volition, which is the domain of the citta and where individual responsibility lies.

    >Even though we experience it (citta/sankhara) as being separate from things appearing or manifesting, how can we be so sure it must predate this body? Maybe both are possible? It appeared in this life but we are not fettered by it for as long as we live?

    It wasn't stated that the citta "predates" the body, since that would assume it to be a positive entity that can stand on its own independently of experiences, which the Suttas [repeatedly state is a wrong view](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn38#mn38:7.3-mn38:8.7) (a similar statement but with the feeling aspect of the citta appears in MN 146). The point is that the citta/consciousness cannot have had its first point at the moment of *conception* (or, even more nonsensically, at some specific instant where the brain became sufficiently developed), which might sound the same but isn't.

    The reason for that is that the conception and growth of an embryo are physical processes, and if we have accepted that the mind is not material/solely produced by matter (which we cannot coherently deny if we regard choice and action as real, as explained in the essay), there would be a contradiction. It would imply that "something else" unrelated to the physical developmental process played a part in the manifestation of the citta (otherwise it would be fully material).

    Now, we are not intrinsically forced into one possibility of what that "something else" is—one could assume it to be God or some cosmic force. But that would mean that we're not responsible for the state of our citta, that something or somebody else made it as it is. So if we assume that we *are* responsible for our ignorance and craving and thus are able to liberate ourselves through our own effort, the only logical conclusion is that we'd been making choices before our conception too.

    Of course, if someone is not already inclined to accept certain premises, they'd still be able to reject the whole argument, which is why it's not a "proof" of rebirth. But it does show why both the validity of action and the possibility of "another world" are part of the mundane right view. They're not culturally conditioned ideas that occur together by mere chance.

    Roughly put, yes. But it's not like the citta somehow "enters" one body, then stays there for a while, then "leaves", and then "enters" a new body. The entire time, *nāmarūpa* must be there in order for consciousness to exist in any shape or form. So it's more like the aggregates just change in it their content from one life to the next, but that "second layer" of views, habits, and assumptions persists, [exactly as it does within this very life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFWRsPGXsL0). Hence the Buddha said that when remembering past lives, all one can remember is the five aggregates or one among them (SN 22.79).

    But, again, without *some* kind of first layer of experience being given, that second layer would be totally inconceivable, which means it cannot rightly be taken as "my self", nor as what's primary or fundamental. In order to be a self, it would need to be independent.

    Also, there will always be a limit to how much you can describe "rebirth". It's inconceivable to even imagine or describe your point of view "from outside", because your point of view would shift onto that which is imagining the process of rebirth right then and there.

    >Sure, the second order sankhara of intending the arisen intention MAY be accompanied by positive phenomena (the thought: "No, I'm not going to eat ice cream again today" or "I'll have it just one more time"), BUT the actual "jumping on" that possibility/1st order intention (or abstaining from it) seems to be something that cannot be pinpointed, isn't it?

    It cannot be pinpointed on the level of specificity that people are generally used to, yes. But one for whom the signs of the mind start to be revealed (through training in virtue and restraint) would be able to recognize that "taking up" of intentions that initially felt "invisible" or even "automatic", and they would come to see that all which they initially thought was restraint of unwholesome intentions was actually just another way of taking them up (although it's certainly much more wholesome than full-on bodily and verbal indulgence, so it's not that it's "wrong"; it's just that it still needed further refinement).

    >Edit: just to expand...if we were to take someone who is sense restrained....in terms of positive phenomena, BEFORE and AFTER they decided to ABSTAIN from eating the ice cream would look exactly the same, wouldn't it?

    >When the possibility of eating ice cream arises as a thought, versus when the person has decided not to act on that thought ... in terms of positive phenomena, it's exactly the same: a thought of ice cream persisiting. It's just that in the latter, the decision not to act on the thought has been made (which is not visible as a phenomenon).

    Yes, you could put it that way. What would "look" different is if they either decided to proliferate the thoughts of ice cream with desire (let alone if they ended up physically acting), or if they tried to deny the ice cream forcefully and thereby stir up new thoughts now driven by aversion.\* Both of these are failure in sense restraint (not grasping at signs and features that arouse longing or aversion).

    A negative phenomenon is *still* a phenomenon, and that's quite important to recognize so as to not fall into mystification ("it's hidden and indescribable"), which would be the opposite extreme from assuming that the citta can be pinned down in specific thoughts or other positive manifestations.

    \*And when the Suttas talk about sati and all the different themes and ways for establishing it, the purpose of that is also on that "negative" level, not in replacing how the experience "looks" (or feels). You do have to attend to them at the positive level for a brief moment in order to establish them ([if it's clear that they were absent](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=sn35.246#sn35.246:1.1-sn35.246:1.11)), but the goal is for them to linger in the background "coloring" the negative rightly. They are second-order [perceptions](https://suttacentral.net/an7.49/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin). Note also that it's the *same contexts* that both the person who overly denies things and the one who goes by the middle way would be using; the difference is in whether they understand the negative or not ([the simile of the cook](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=sn47.8)).

### Sense restraint, how hard to push, what about when I mess up?

Lately my Buddhist practice has evolved from very meditation-centric, to now including other aspects of the path. For example, I have been practicing more generosity, kindness, metta, dhana at the monestary, and... sense restraint. I find that I'm very critical of myself when it comes to practicing sense restraint, because in my way of thinking, it's a practice of NOT doing certain things. Whereas, metta, dhana, being kind to others and that sort of thing is a practice of remembering to do things, and even if I just do a little bit I reflect on the goodness of it and that makes me feel good. 
But when it comes to sense restraint, I feel like I'm constantly second guessing my resolve. I determine to refrain from things, the pressure of boredom or craving gets too strong to bare, and I give in sometimes. Then I feel pretty terrible. I feel like I'm now caught in a pattern similar to addiction, and I don't think my approach has been very healthy or helpful to me. Can someone please take the time to explain to me an example of a gradual training in sense restraint? 

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1d32drw/sense_restraint_how_hard_to_push_what_about_when/l64x7pj/)** _2024-05-29 05:39:53:

    Unless you see no further work to do in regard to the 8 precepts, you shouldn't be worrying about sense restraint to begin with:

    >*When the bhikkhu is virtuous*, the Realized One guides him further: ‘Come, bhikkhu, guard your sense doors.

    If that's covered, then you want to realize that beating yourself up is itself a failure in sense restraint (grasping at signs and features that induce states of longing and upset), and also recognize that by the time you end up with an intense pressure to do something unwholesome, you have already been failing to guard your senses properly for a good while, probably by doing things and dwelling on thoughts that you take for granted as justified or appropriate. The pressure never builds up in one instant.

    These two talks might be useful: [Why you keep losing sense restraint?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdYTDYZv7kw&pp=ygUldW5sYXBzaW5nIG9mIHNlbnNlIHJlc3RyYWludCBoaWxsc2lkZQ%3D%3D), [The Unlapsing of Your Self Restraint](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZ0JKWqRTho&pp=ygUldW5sYXBzaW5nIG9mIHNlbnNlIHJlc3RyYWludCBoaWxsc2lkZQ%3D%3D).

    I referred to the reason in [Restraining the Senses](https://www.hillsidehermitage.org/restraining-the-senses/#):

    >If you have not—as a prerequisite, not even as a guarantee—indefinitely abandoned the possibility to break these precepts in the future and any openness to acting unskillfully by body and speech[^(15)](https://www.hillsidehermitage.org/restraining-the-senses/#5784f14f-3600-4f3e-8e7a-c9202dc77d14), you *will* be grasping at the signs and features of things that induce unwholesome states on some level, whether you realize it or not. Your intentions for the future, as in the actions that you are at least *open* to doing at some undefined point later on, influence every moment of your present, no matter if you’re not planning or dwelling on them at all.

    That's why in all Gradual Training expositions, the two are always in that order. And in DN 10, the precepts are within the aggregate of virtue, while sense restraint is placed in the aggregate of *samādhi*.

    You could regard them as closely related, but technically sense restraint pertains to a subtler level of subduing unwholesome states (see the reply to u/craveminerals below).

    It's not that sense restraint prevents you from breaking the precepts. You choosing not to break the precepts despite the pressure prevents you from breaking the precepts. And on the basis of that, you can then learn to guard your sense doors

    Taking it the other way around implies the view of management: that you need to do something, in this case sense restraint, to diminish the pressure first in order to not give in to it, thereby absolving you of responsibility to a degree.

    >Are you saying that the 8 precepts can be upheld through will power and determination alone, and do not require a level of sense restraint mastery for one to uphold them at all times?

    [Yes](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn54#mn54:4.2-mn54:4.12), although not exclusively through will power. Reflection is the one factor that plays a part in every stage of the Gradual Training, including the establishment of virtue. But still, the purpose of reflection is not to diminish the amount of pressure you have to endure when keeping the precepts, but to *remind* yourself of why you should stand your ground no matter how tempting it is to give in. It won't absolve you of responsibility or do the restraint for you.

    Sometimes, you can't rely on your own determination alone, and you need to tailor your environment. So you could try to find ways to ensure you only have access to the internet during specific periods where you need it for practical purposes (if at all). There is hardly a justification for ever switching the TV on if you're aiming for the 8 precepts though.

    There are applications for PCs and mobile phones that allow you to block access to certain or all applications on a scheduled basis.

### How to contemplate dullness and drowsiness without falling sleep

Compared to the other four hindrances, I'm having hard time with drowsiness. I'm talking in general, not just in the context of sitting meditation, which I do with opened eyes.

Ven. Anigha put it simple what we should do

>"Knowing it" means you are aware of it's presence to the extent that neither succumb to it, nor do you overshoot it and act as if you're entitled to control the arising of pressure (SN 1.1)

With the other four hindrances, or other obstacles like self-identity, once I've identified them, it follows the realization of "such thing is not mine, not my doing, etc" (without having to think about it). Most of the times that's enough to not get dragged further. I keep contemplating the mind, and the hindrances tend to cease quite fast. If they persist long, I work as suggested in MN 20 until they are gone.

With drowsiness... I know it, yet I am likely to succumb to it. The MN 20 approach doesn't help me that much. Unless other hindrances, trying to trace back its origin gives me little insight - apart from the fact I'm lacking of energy, determination, and maybe faith with the practice. Most of the times I am not able to arouse the energy to get out of drowsiness, or if I do, it's only temporally, and after some minutes drowsiness came back stronger. Sometimes I try to contemplate the fact of dead, the fact that this change of being human and in touch with the dhamma is so rare, to develop a sense of urgency to get out of samsara... but they tend to become just a dull contemplation and I keep being dragged by drowsiness.

So, eventually I jump into the methods suggested in AN 7.61. The mechanical advice of taking a nap or washing the face with cold water and then walk for twenty minutes are the only solutions that work in most occasions - cutting the dullness for some hours. Yet, this falls into the "management" method.

Any suggestion to address this topic? I have read quite a bunch of material on this hindrance, but nothing that worked.

    >I keep contemplating the mind, and **the hindrances tend to cease quite fast.** If they persist long, I work as suggested in MN 20 until they are gone.

    This suggests that you're still operating under a misunderstanding of what the hindrances are. They are not specific objects that "cease" in that straightforward manner. As others have pointed out, that's management of sense objects, not uprooting of hindrances.

    >And what is the fuel for the arising of unarisen indolence-and-lethargy, or for the increase and growth of arisen indolence-and-lethargy? There is discontent, tiredness, yawning, sleepiness after eating, and mental sluggishness. Frequent attention not through the origin (*ayoniso manasikāra)* **in relation to that** is the fuel for the arising of unarisen indolence-and-lethargy, or for the increase and growth of arisen indolence-and-lethargy.

    —SN 46.51

    What this is saying is that the drowsiness itself is not the hindrance; it's your lack of perspective in regard to it that is. So what you need to do is stop indulging in the sleepiness without then wanting to not be sleepy, which is the opposite extreme. You do that by maintaining a simultaneous perspective of a subtler aspect of your present experience while the sleepiness is there, such as your bodily posture or the unpleasant feeling that's present (4 satipaṭṭhānas). And you sustain that perspective only to the extent that you don't get absorbed in the sleepiness, not more than that, and you certainly don't cultivate an expectation for it to ever go away. 

    The steadier you are in that perspective, the less the drowsiness will be problem or a hindrance, and the more the mind will be dispassionate and at ease within the same situation.

    And it's the same principle for all the other hindrances, which means you weren't really abandoning them. You were just suppressing that which *triggers* the hindrances, and now you encountered the one trigger that's not in your control.

    >What I meant is "once I've identified a mental-object (feeling or thought) related to/powered by a hindrance \[...\] I keep contemplating the mind, and such mental-object tend to cease quite fast".

    Still, you seem to think that their ceasing matters, which it doesn't. In fact, you could say that if they cease, you have no criterion to tell whether your mind is actually calm and composed or not. So getting them to cease is even counterproductive.

    >Management means "acting out of the mental objects" and uprooting/endurance means "contemplate the mental objects without being affected by them", right?

    Not necessarily. You could be "contemplating the mental objects without being affected by them" still with an implicit view that the *objects* carry any amount of blame for the unwholesome states, and that would still be management even if not as crudely.

    Uprooting of craving as opposed to management means recognizing that none of those arisen things are the issue; *ayoniso manasikāra* and not enduring them rightly is the issue.

    >the unwholesome state come from my inability to remain equanimous and keep the right view in regard of such objects, which means that I react - even without noticing it. It is this reaction the one creating the unwholesome state and the *issue to be cared of*. Is that right?

    Essentially, yes. And the "reaction" is already the view and context that you carry, even if you don't explicitly choose to do this or that.

    >Well, what mattered is that while contemplating without (being aware of) acting out of them I didn't get dragged further, as opposed to drowsiness. 

    Yes, you didn't get "dragged further", but for the wrong reason (i.e., because you got rid of the pull, not because you anchored yourself well enough to not be dragged in face of the pull). If it was the right type of equanimity, it would've worked in the case of drowsiness too, since there is nothing fundamental setting it apart from the others. They're all equally bodily phenomena that the mind/context is either unaffected by not (which is the sole factor determining whether they're hindrances or not). And from that point of view, "fast" or "slow" simply do not apply, because being affected is measured by a *choice* you make in regard to whatever has arisen, and ceasing to make a choice does not take time whatsoever.

    So whether it's restlessness or drowsiness, what you need to do is take what has arisen as a given, and simply make sure you don't lose perspective for as long as it lasts, even if it's for 10 years. It won't matter how long it lasts if you establish the right attitude, because the right peace and samādhi come from the absence of craving, not from getting certain experiences and avoiding others (and quick movements of mind and drowsiness are not craving in themselves). And that's why *this* type of samādhi frees you from all suffering in regard to anything that could conceivably come your way, no matter how extreme or unexpected.

    [This talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igC9gzKZV6o) might be helpful.

    (Note also that this right attitude needs to be sustained for a prolonged period of time for the mind to calm down; it's not that the second you get it right you'll feel peaceful. That's why faith is essential; without it, you won't be able to "stay" in that middle ground but will fall into either indulgence or management of the arisen states).

### The dangers and compromises of the crowded and dusty household life

Greetings,

I’m an engaged father existentially torn by the compromise that I’m accepting by choosing a busy householder lifestyle.

What follows is a narration of the events from the last few years that lead to this situation, accompanied by some considerations and questions.

I would be very interested in reading the perspectives and advice of this community, both on my personal situation and on the general topic of practice and close family relationships.  
Discussing personal circumstances and choices of a stranger on the internet could be perceived as a delicate matter so I would like to give green light to frank or even stern comments, if deemed helpful. I assume the responsibility for receiving the feedback skillfully.  
Before getting to the story, I would also like to express my gratitude to all the contributors of this supportive and insightful community.

**A short history of the last few years**

I'm 33, European living abroad in another European country, in an intimate relationship, father of a 2,5 years old boy. My journey with Buddhism started in 2016 in a period of existential crisis, depression and anxiety with the books of Ajahn Sumedho. Buddhism played a central role in helping me recover my mental health. Not so much through meditation but by showing me that the anguish over the fundamental lack of control on my health, mind and ultimately life was not the sign of a pathology but the natural consequence of starting to see life as rooted in apprehension and ignorance. Easier said than done though, I had to spiral down all the way to the bottom, my attempts at management and control of the mental space swept away, so that I had no choice but to face the extent of my vulnerability and ignorance. That forced surrender might have felt like dying but life went on. I slowly came out of that dark period with increased confidence and I gradually nurtured enough energy and courage to leave my country and to travel in order to "find myself” and to find a place where to settle and start a new life.

I landed in my current country at the end of 2019 and just three weeks later I met the woman that is to this day my partner. On October 2021 she gave birth to our son. With the demands of having and raising a child together our relationship was put to a test. Our true characters and entrenched views and values emerged. On my side Buddhism started to re-emerge and worldly engagement to diminish. On my partner side the physical exhaustion and a rough return to work solidified a situation of depression. As a couple we lacked the common ground and communication skills to navigate the tough situation we found ourselves in. We were swamped.

**Notable recent events**

The crisis lasted for months and reached a turning point last November, when we decided to take a one-week break. After that we resumed with renewed energy and commitment to try better. The first half of December was a period of cautious optimism after two years of struggle.

In the second half of December I spent one week in a sort of retreat as a lay supporter: one monk (currently residing in Samanadīpa) spent two months in a winter refuge supported by a rotation of 2 to 5 lay people. This event turned out to be unexpectedly impactful on me. The monk shared with me his monastic experience and the transition toward HH/Samanadīpa. I recall telling him that a few months earlier I came across a video from Ñāṇamoli and proceeded to read a bit of his latest book. While I was intrigued by the clarity and power of his exposition I put it down because it sounded too self-assured, a level of confidence that I was not used to within Buddhist contexts. I assumed that something had to be off considering that the most respected monks of the Forest Tradition of Ajahn Chah were all adopting a more cautious approach. The monk suggested me to consider giving it a second try, all while maintaining my alertness and critical sense.

In a table in the corner of the main room there was a printed copy of the essay from Venerable Anīgha "[Sīla is samādhi](https://www.hillsidehermitage.org/sila-is-samadhi/)". To call it eye-opening is an understatement. I felt like I found the answers to the deepest questions I had about Buddhism and meditation since the beginning of my search. I felt an intense trust in the concepts and the practice explained in the essay, I could not detect any "red flags" or weak points to anchor my general tendency to skepticism. I use the word *feeling* since *understanding* as a puthujjana is an elusive concept. This said I knew in which direction to strive after coming home from the retreat: first, with new-found clarity on the role of virtue, examining and improving my conduct with regard to precepts. Parallel to this, investigating further the teachings of Ñāṇamoli, Anīgha and the other Hillside Hermitage monks.  
Along with this, with time for reflection during the retreat, it became clear to me that the option of a second child was off the table.

But...Samsara stroke back and just a week after my return we found out that my partner was pregnant. The result of recklessness in that short peaceful period at the beginning of the month. We had multiple factors pointing to a very low risk of pregnancy (also based on the experience with the first one). Yet low is not zero.

This said it would be simplistic to consider it just recklessness, we both had a shared nebulous aspiration to have a second child and the awareness that the biological clock was running. Considering the already difficult situation we had we knew that it would have been extremely distressing for everyone involved for a few years. But we also imagined it to be a preferable long term scenario for the kids to have siblings, and for the family to be bigger, especially in case the parents would separate. If this doesn’t make full sense it’s because these were instinctual considerations for the most part.  
Not taking precautions was a sort of semi-conscious yet intentional distraction from the burden of a choice with complex implications. Eluding the responsibility of choosing between actively trying to have children or carefully refraining from risking. During the retreat I had some space to listen to myself, to see this dynamic from a distance and to resolve to put a stop to it. But it was already too late. Few things in life remind us of the extent to which we are heirs to our actions as sex. A few minutes of pleasure leading to a new life coming to this world and multiple lives getting further entangled in the wheel.

The first trimester of pregnancy was, as it’s often the case, very hectic. For my partner nausea and emotional ups and downs. As for me, I was determined in pushing us to face our relationship issues and at the same time I was restraining sex as much as I could, and similarly reducing my social life, entertainment and distractions. It sounds like the recipe for a (mundane) disaster, and indeed it was. With the increased pressure the relationship with my partner steadily deteriorated. At the end of March we broke up, with the awareness that it would only be a partial and ambiguous separation due to the children.

During this phase I was reading Ñāṇamoli books, most of the essays and many threads in here, the Youtube videos became a daily Dhamma talk, and I got much pondering on sensuality, relationships, sex and how to conduct myself as a partner and father. The struggles I was facing were actually confirming the validity of the practice, as I could see that all the worldly pressure that we were experiencing could not be solved by worldly solutions or meditation. Those domains could either temporarily mitigate the suffering or suggest a new arrangement with slightly less suffering. Projecting this over the years or the decades I found it unsatisfying, simply put I couldn't believe in this approach.  
Other insights came from the stricter virtue that I was upholding and that heralded a crisis of sex. With the crisis of sex the myth of romantic love showed all of its fragility. Without the cover-up of unrestrained sensuality the problems could press with all their weight and could hardly be avoided. We realized how different our values and aspirations had become and our hope for a future together reached its minimum point.

Going to back to the break-up and its fuzzy nature. On one hand it's very easy for it to be just a nominal thing, since we are committed to being parents together and with physical proximity and the fluctuation of feelings, we are basically guaranteed to "fall" again for each other (as it’s been partially happening in the last days). On the other hand after two months of break, despite the stronger cravings for sensuality and the intoxication that accompanies them, I’m stable in the conviction that, as far as the two of us are concerned, we would be better off separating our lives completely. She could find a more aligned partner. I could pursue a lifestyle more suitable to training.

**The predicament**

The matter of fact is that as there are father and mother, there are son and (in three months) daughter. The bonds and needs of these four people become stronger and more complex than those of just a man and a woman. Juggling such a situation is already challenging in a conventional scenario, stark differences in values and desired lifestyle among the partners make it prohibitively hard. This is the crux of my conundrum. Not that it is unique to me, it’s actually a common situation that millions have faced before and that millions face today. The romantic relationship becomes the easy part to figure out compared to the implications on two human beings that are not self sufficient. All of this distress and struggle ultimately coming from ignorance and liability to the craving for procreation.

If I were to ask for advice for my predicament, the most simple way to phrase it would be: "what should I do?" To which the clean, unadulterated, answer seems to me to be: give all you have to your family, leave everything and go forth. Or at the very least sculpt a lifestyle that would allow to live as similarly to a renunciate as possible. If one could commit to that decision with unremitting determination, that would be it, given that the kids and the mother will not risk their lives.

I can see a few problems with that. First of all I would not do that *fully* for the right reasons. More or less consciously there would be the intention to dodge the burden of responsibility and of the many duties. In my puthujjana view that would make the action unwholesome, rooted in the desire to not reap the fruits of my unwholesome actions. On top of that I don’t see myself as able to sustain a fully renunciate lifestyle while enduring the sting of remorse for abandoning my family. I can see that avoiding remorse remorse is not a good reason to choose the householder life. I decide it to be such out of aversion for the displeasure of remorse and the pressure of societal norms and morality. Yet I can’t deny the right-in-front-of-me reality of this suffering, I can’t reason it away and I think that I wouldn't be able to endure it in the long term.

>I would phrase my question like this: what is the best among the inferior alternatives that one has to choose from when deciding to remain a father householder? How to minimize suffering for the all parts involved considering the limitations in my virtue, wisdom or faith in the Dhamma?

You can stop reading here if you want, this is already quite long. Below are some notes of mine, attempts at tackling the thorny situation. Plus a couple of very recent developments.

**Some considerations that I made in the past weeks**

These are more explorations of different scenarios, to investigate my inclination and reactions, rather than thought-out solutions.

I don’t have much doubt regarding the first months of the newborn, I’ll be there and do my part. The doubts arise when thinking about the vague "mid-long term”.

I could try to keep a clear distance, be available when needed, but not on a daily basis as an "engaged" father. Or having a schedule with days for family and days for seclusion. Is that sustainable? Is it imaginable that my partner would accept to carry this uneven burden? If I saw them struggling and I had the desire to help more, should I refrain from doing so?

As a more extreme variation of the above I could move away from family, keep sustaining them financially and only occasionally visit them, provided that my partner would be willing to see me. This seems just a strictly worse alternative to becoming an anagarika, as I would keep the family/relationship door half-open while not taking steps toward the renunciate life.

I could commit to continue as a father until the newborn is past the critical phase of the first 1-2 years and then detach. But commitments for the future don't truly exist, you can only commit in the present. In the future it will be a new decision. And likely not any easier than now. Is there truly a better moment for kids to lose the constant presence of the father? These are for the most part mundane considerations that would in any case openly oppose the idea of the father disengaging from the life of their children.

The only option that I see having the potential to support my practice goes in the opposite direction of what I mentioned so far.  
Since I have a good amount of savings I could provide for myself and my family (my partner is also earning a solid salary) for quite some time without working. I could resign from work and dedicate my time to either practice or family. If I can't fully choose between family and practice, I can then choose to not pursue other things outside of these two. This could help in a few ways:

* more time, of course. Although it’s all to be seen whether I will manage to spend this time wisely.
* pressure on myself, financial and societal.

I’ve always been a conscientious person, saving, restraining my expenses in gratification and status. The main reason for this was the famous safety net, preparing for the worst, but also giving myself more options for future decisions, without having money as a constraint. The flip side of this is that it favors an orientation toward the future and attachment toward savings, nurturing a misplaced sense of safety. Seeing the finances that I accumulated going down will induce stress and anxiety, possibly a good subject of contemplation.

When it comes to work, my conditioning and the societal consensus would agree that not to work is reproachable, a choice that denotes a lazy or immature person. In the case of a man or a father it would acquire an even stronger connotation, of failure, of going against the way things are, including the word of the Christian god that still influences us all. Going against this particular grain of the world would be a remarkable source of pressure and as such a further dimension of training.

* pressure on the couple: this is quite evident. If sex is one of the pillars of worldly love, a mutually advantageous financial and status arrangement is another. Many women don’t need a man to earn as much as possible in absolute terms, but they would definitely want for their man to earn as much as *he can* without sacrificing family. I’m not judging here, but money plays an important role in the level of reassurance and trust that most women feels towards men, thus leading to attraction and attachment. Willingly renouncing a salary is throwing a wrench into the mundane happiness and stability of a couple, possibly even more than abstaining from sex. Another source of pressure, one that could accelerate the couple toward its destiny. Another subject for contemplation.

What is clear to me is that regardless of how the specific family/relationship situation will look like, I should make the establishment of the Eight Precepts my main aspiration in the practice. More on this in a minute.

**Latest developments**

I wrote the first draft of this post few weeks ago. In the meantime two things happened:

* I had a couple of conversations with my partner. I made it clear that I don’t want to "get back together” as a "traditional couple”. At the same time I’m of the opinion that if sex is in the picture, then it doesn’t really matter how you call the relationship. We both know that we are in a partnership for the kids. From my side it feels like a tender friendship that becomes unstable and unclear in its nature due to the pull of sexuality. It’s surprising how little remains about romantic love once you imagine to remove sex from the picture. Striving toward and sustaining celibacy is going to be a hard endeavor for me, but I see that as a necessity if I want to make progress.

>Celibacy seems unattainable with the current situation and my level of development. At the same time I can’t accept not striving toward it. How to approach this situation? Any insight on this subject is particularly welcome.

* Just few days ago we signed a rental agreement for a house in the suburbs, a much calmer area compared to the city. The kids needed a bigger place, this has to be done regardless. But the practical implication is that I go back to fully living with my partner and I can only assume that this will bring complications alongside the practical advantages. The upside is that the new environment is quieter, slower and less proliferated in sensuality compared to the city.

It’s time to put down the pencil, one last comment connecting with the initial paragraph: I would not share such a personal and sensitive topic in 99% of communities, including Buddhist ones. I would be basically assured to come across as either socially maladjusted or thoroughly misled on what the Buddha said ("you are a lay person so feel free to enjoy responsible sex with your partner”). Yet even in this community I got to see that the topic of family and detachment remains a delicate one. I appreciate the different perspectives on the subject. And once again I would like to clear the way for forthright comments if any comes to mind.

Thank you for your attention and insights, may you all progress steadily in the Path.

    What's most important is that you hammer in—not only once, but on a daily basis—the recognition that every bit of effort you may put into these worldly affairs is effort that you're not putting into the Dhamma (the Dhamma that truly matters: "the relinquishment of all appropriations, dispassion, cessation, Nibbāna"). The worst possible outcome of all would be if you allow yourself to ignore that and think you're developing both opposite goals at once, which is what most "practicing" lay Buddhists do so as to get an easy way out of the mental dissonance that would be otherwise (rightly) be there. Naturally, that is the least *unpleasant* outcome, but how things make us feel is by no means a criterion for their rightness.

    The Buddha did not regard it as automatically wrong for a father to abandon his children ([Ud 1.8](https://suttacentral.net/ud1.8/en/anandajoti?lang=en&reference=none&highlight=false)), and he himself did so when he went forth. That's not to say that doing so is inherently skillful, of course. If you try to cover up the burden of guilt, and there is that sense of *escaping* from your responsibility, then it will be an unwholesome decision. If leaving it all behind feels like a *relief* rather than the taking on of a much greater burden, then that's a red flag (though not necessarily any worse than continuing to nurture passion and lust that will be even harder to undo later, so that still doesn't mean it's better to stay).

    The points made [in this video ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGsEduacoGo)apply almost verbatim to this scenario too (and perhaps it's useful to consider that, unlike parents, the Buddha never made wife and children a potential obstacle to ordination, even though the complaints and accusations leveled at the Saṅgha were surely not few).

    Now, if that's too much to handle for the time being, the next best thing (which would still be a compromise but not an insurmountable one) is to take on the 8 precepts as a layperson, and make sure that you don't make further decisions that will interfere with that or make it more difficult than it has to be. So, living together with your partner would be very ill-advised from that point of view, even if the intended purpose is to support the children.

    The least difficult thing to do in your situation that would still provide a [realistic opportunity](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn53) to gain the Right View would be to live apart from your children and provide financial support from afar, perhaps seeing them from time to time, but it's not a guarantee that split parenthood would result in a better situation for the kids in the emotional dimension than if you were not there at all. It can just result in more conflict and confusion, and on top of that you would hardly be anything but a bore for them to be with if you're committed to sense restraint.  It will also force you to keep working, which takes up a gigantic chunk of time that is, from the point of view of Dhamma, mostly going down the drain. So you would end up doing two things mediocrely instead of one of the two properly.

    Of course it's a crucial consideration, and that's why I made sure to emphasize that it's not a decision to take lightly. My aim is not to tell OP what to do, but simply to make him clearly understand that if he does choose to *truly* prioritize the welfare of his children—which he is free to do, but it would require him to live with his partner and make that relationship work out at all costs—he cannot realistically hope to realize the Dhamma (that is taught in the Suttas at least) for many years or even decades to come, if ever.

    Any age deemed "appropriate" to leave one's children would ultimately be arbitrary and objectionable, and there is no reason why one wouldn't get carried away well past that point and then decide that it's still too early (or too late) to step away. Passion and attachment will grow; they won't stay static. On the other hand, I doubt that a child who realizes their father stayed only the minimum amount of time to fulfill an external obligation and then left would feel less hurt than one who doesn't even remember their father.

    >Maybe I can keep it grounded with this question: toward the end of the thread I mentioned the possibility of not working or working half-time, since I could support myself and my family for some time using my savings. What would be your perspective on this?

    That would improve the outlook very little unless you would be celibate and probably limit your role almost solely to financial support. Practically speaking, according to what you've written, it's unlikely that you would succeed in that unless you live separately. Furthermore, living with them will inevitably be impeding your mental clarity and biasing whatever decision you make. So it would be advisable to step out for a prolonged period of time (for the next three months at minimum might be a good start) if you want the choice to be "yours" to the greatest possible degree, whatever that choice ends up being.

    It's also not just a matter of what will obstruct your practice *right now*, but how the attachment will inevitably grow if you succumb to the amount of it that's already there. Despite how difficult it may feel to disentangle yourself now, you can't expect there to come a point where the bond is any weaker (unless unexpected events *forcefully* disentangle you, but that's obviously neither desirable nor a safe bet).

    >If I genuinely think that going forth is too much for me now and I decide to do my absolute best as a layman *as a way to prepare myself for going forth in the future*: could there be some wisdom there or is just a rationalization to not deal with pain and regret now?

    Depends on what you mean with as "as a layman". Continuing to live and engage emotionally with your family would be the opposite of preparation for renunciation, and you could only take it as such by gaslighting yourself and ignoring what's actually happening to your mind.

    >In the second paragraph the comment is "so you would end up doing two things mediocrely instead of one of the two properly." I'm not sure how to reconcile the two.

    The point was that taking your kids as a reason to stay a layperson but still caring about the practice enough to do what it takes to succeed in it will prevent you from doing either of them to the best of your ability. Either way, in terms of Dhamma, the compromise is not insurmountable, as I said.

    >The "not making further decisions" includes not seeing the children more frequently than "from time to time", correct?

    I wrote "further decisions" mainly in relation to committing to live with your partner and allowing the bond to grow; that's the main categorical impediment to progress. With the kids it's not set in stone as much. It would depend more on your intention behind spending more time with them. If it's something practical that you had little to no say in and it's not you [*seeking* it out of passion](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=thag2.34), then it wouldn't necessarily be an obstacle.

    >The thing is that 8 precepts + not seeing the children + "social" seclusion (because any contact outside of strict necessities would be "company" and thus breaking the 7th precept) + not having any mentor/noble friend to keep an eye on me seems not only brutal but possibly dangerous.

    You don't have to take on everything at once. If you're able to remain celibate and sever romantic ties, and tailor your environment to support that decision, you can regard that as a success for the time being. Over time you can refine it. But failing that, nothing else you do afterwards can make up for it.

    >Here with "step out" it's meant keeping a significant distance (living separately, helping only with strictly needed things) or complete separation?

    At least living separately and meeting only when there's a true need. That would allow for more mental clarity than you have now.

    >I'm trying to understand precisely where is the threshold for having some progress and where is the maximum that I can give as of now. If the distance for this is too big, at least where is the threshold for \*not regressing\*.

    Of the options you gave, option (c) would probably be the maximum realistically speaking, and it would still allow you to reevaluate later on. If you really want to avoid getting caught in quicksand, however, you'll need to have nerves of steel, and during those three months regard yourself as a hired worker who's there exclusively to fulfill practical duties and nothing more (and it would help if you made that clear to her in advance). That would be the context you'd need to protect like your life depends on it.

    >I'm anguished. Since your first reply last Sunday, it feels like grief. Moments of denials, bargaining, depression. And it seems that it started to *really* burn just from Friday. My words were carriers of a lot of pain and tension, like many times before in the last few months. The physical tension going to her body, the belly hurting, knowing that this is not good for the child. It's hard to not feel like you are actively hurting not another human being, but two of them, the two most vulnerable categories. The words of Thaniyo Thero about harming people that depend on you coming to mind.

    Just to re-clarify, you don't *have* to do this.There's no external authority or moral code that's going to punish you for choosing to maintain the status quo. 

    >Should I be there for her if she has a crisis? Whether she needs to talk or she needs help with the child. I'm going to help with the moving in around a week. Can I be kind to her like I could be to a friend? That would probably be confusing for both of us. Once she will give birth, can I hug her and tell her something nice?

    I can't be fully certain from my perspective, but your hesitation suggests that you might not be entirely sure about this decision. You should be sure that if you choose this path, it's because you know clearly that you value the liberation of your own mind above all else. This way, you won’t second-guess yourself in the future, or at least you’ll have a stronger foundation when doubts and regrets inevitably arise.

    This doesn’t mean you're justified in doubling down on your investment in your family because you're not sure, but just that you probably shouldn’t make permanent decisions just yet. If you choose renunciation, ideally, you should have the internal confidence and certainty to stay committed to that path even when things get tough, without relying on something or someone else to motivate you. You don't want to end up in a position where you realize somewhere down the line that your renunciation was propelled by a temporary inspiration.

    Regardless, just to reiterate, make sure you don't deceive yourself into thinking that at some undefined point in the future renunciation will be any easier than it is now, or that you'll be able to "have your cake and eat it too" (i.e., reach significant milestones in the Dhamma *while* valuing and pursuing sensuality).

    >The first consideration is: can "staying as an engaged father" be *ever* the right answer? Is there a world, outside of risk for survival, where it could be the correct decision? It seems not.  

    Depends on what you mean with "correct". If you mean aiding or at least not hindering progress on the path, then no, it's never correct. But again, it's not a sacred commandment that you *have* to progress on the path. It's up to you.

    > The second consideration is about how to deal with my current status in terms of talking/writing with other people. Making it clear that ideally I shouldn't look at others to help me carry the weight of this.  
      
    Yes, "ideally". But this situation is already far from ideal, so if you end up going through with the decision and use the support of other people as a temporary crutch you know you need to give up eventually, it's still a net win.

    >And now I get to the main question. How should I regard writing as a tool? Both to myself, personal notes like the \~30 I wrote in the past couple of days. And comments here in this forum. Is it skillful? Is it simply a thing that I can accept although not ideal? 

    Same applies to this.

### Dhamma Essay: Unyoked from Biology



- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1czdxza/dhamma_essay_unyoked_from_biology/l5gw08m/)** _2024-05-24 13:32:08:

    There was one paragraph which for some reason got misplaced ("The points here established also serve to highlight why the approach taken towards..."). It's fixed now.

    A good number of exchanges with you on this sub have shown that you're set on your interpretation of the Dhamma and will stand by it even when shown Sutta passages that, if not outright disproving it, at least challenge it (as present throughout this essay too). 

    Given this, I suggest we spare each other the time and effort and simply agree to disagree.
- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1czdxza/dhamma_essay_unyoked_from_biology/l5kgxus/)** _2024-05-25 03:40:41 *(in reply to a comment not included)*:

    What you're referring to as "decision making" is a phenomenon far more elaborate than what is called "intention" in the Suttas. Intention proper (*cetanā* or *saṅkhāra)* operates on the level of things that ordinary people would regard as "involuntary" although they're not, such as breathing and thinking, and ultimately the defilements.

    So yes, an Arahant's ability to make intelligent decisions in the world might get impaired by a brain injury, but that cannot possibly force them to have a wrong attitude in relation to the phenomena they experience, and because of that, none of those decisions would involve craving or unskillful motivations.

    >if i had misrepresented the suttas, i would hope that someone would bring this to my attention rapidly.

    Hours have been devoted to this both by me and others, with copious Sutta references, and somehow we keep coming back to square one every single time, which is why I at least have given up.

    The main problem is that you fail to understand even the meaning of the points we make accurately, regardless of whether you agree with them or not, and you never seem to make an effort to rectify that. Therefore, almost all of the arguments you present believing they're valid rebuttals are basically straw-men or red herrings. The fact that you're unable to grasp the ideas being offered at least theoretically, let alone recognize that you don't  understand them, suggests that you hold to your view(s) much more tightly than you are perhaps aware.

    >there is no need for anyone to get upset or antagonised at my words - **they are not my words; they are the buddha’s words**

    And then you make statements like these while often attempting to present yourself as a humble figure. Anyone with whom discussion is worthwhile would be at least willing to acknowledge that what they're putting forward is an *interpretation* of the Buddha's words, even if theirs factually happens to be the right one.

    I'm sure there's hundreds of people who have come across this sub, familiarized themselves with the teaching, and chosen to disagree with it, without going out of their way to push their views, regarding themselves as an emissary of the Buddha with the task of protecting (what they believe to be) the True Dhamma.

    >Our attitude towards phenomena has no biophysical underpinnings?

    If you step back "peripherally" enough to determine what that attitude towards phenomena is, then no. That's why ignorance comes first in *paṭiccasamuppāda*; it has no underpinnings other than itself. If it were not so, freedom would not be possible, or at least would be a matter of circumstance (and thus not permanent).

    >ignorance is the state of being pressured by biology. Our biology pressures the mind to volitionally choose actions that causes harm which it accepts because of it's own ignorance. The mind of an arahamt has fully understood the danger of those actions so the mind would never incline towards those things. It's not that the arahamt is a metaphysical entity that has free will which chooses things in a vacuum but that the mind itself does not incline towards that direction through right understanding.  
    So that freedom is a negative freedom in that it is the absence of the pressure from biology. It is unconditioned because craving, Ill will, and delusion no longer arise not because the arahamt is somehow free from biology.

    Yes, that's it. And, as said in the essay, one has to start at the level of bodily and verbal actions (virtue), but ultimately it extends all the way to the five hindrances, craving, and all these things that people generally would think just "occur" to them. They are also very subtle activities that exist due to the mistaken "taking up" of biology, thus the very first link in paṭiccasamuppāda goes: "With ignorance as support, activities are there".

    And that's also why the Suttas add the qualifier "anupādā" to Nibbāna: it always comes through "non-grasping" or "non-assumption", and not by altering or manipulating your experience. And that non-grasping needs to be sequentially developed and understood through the Gradual Training; you can't just start "practicing non-grasping" one evening.

    >where is the line drawn, in the mental domain, towards things caused by the biophysical and that which is not. Reaching my hand towards my phone **with the intention to distract myself** and the acceptance of that intention beforehand, where is there something that is not caused by biological processes?

    It's in the highlighted part. The state of dullness or lethargy due to a lack of stimuli was just biophysical, but your choice to grab the phone was *not* part of the biophysical state; otherwise, there would be no way for you to avoid doing it, just as you couldn't have avoided the state itself. But you *can* avoid doing it, the only problem is it results in displeasure and dissonance that the mind is not able to calmly endure.

    >In the same way, bhikkhus, an unlearned ordinary person, when struck by unpleasant feeling, sorrows, wails, laments, beats their breast and becomes muddled. They feel two feelings: one bodily and one pertaining to the *citta*.

    >Struck by that same unpleasant feeling, they resist it. Thus, the underlying tendency to resistance against unpleasant feeling underlies them.

    >Struck by unpleasant feeling, they delight in the pleasure of sensuality. Why is that? Because, bhikkhus, an unlearned ordinary person doesn’t understand any escape from unpleasant feeling apart from the pleasure of sensuality.

    —[SN 36.6](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=sn36.6)

    Now, if an Arahant performs the same action (or any other) externally, it would also need to have a biophysical impetus, but the difference is that the mind would have remained absolutely unbothered even if they didn't do it (despite the potential pressure). Thus, they are perfectly free to either do it or not; neither would involve passion, aversion, or distraction. \*

    The caveat is that most people unwittingly have (and practice according to) the view that this equanimity comes from suppressing the biophysical pressure to do things (the "first arrow" in the Sutta above). But as said in the essay, that's counterfeit liberation, which is why it's often available for much cheaper (sans steadfast virtue and renunciation).

    \* And any action that contradicts the precepts, including incelibacy, is always performed *because* the mind would've been too disturbed by just enduring the biophysical pressure. Such things cannot be done with a truly equanimous mind, no matter how one rationalizes them. That's why an Arahant is completely beyond them.

    >A wise person is conditioned by his wisdom and understanding. When one becomes a student of the Buddha then one becomes conditioned by the path. One's very being becomes the path so all actions stem from path factors and therefore no longer goes against the path. So the path would be the foremost of all conditioned things.

    Yes, the path is conditioned, as stated in the Suttas.

    >I guess at a certain point, one transcends even the path itself and one is no longer conditioned by either wisdom or ignorance. Actions are no longer necessary, whether wholesome or unwholesome.

    That would be the case for an Arahant; they don't need to be intentionally be heedful anymore. But at the same time, that doesn't mean that they would return to breaking the precepts. Those actions can only be done on the basis of your mind not only being conditioned, but by the wrong things to boot.

    >Does this mean that fear response can't be triggered in him, or that he simply doesn't act out of it?

    If there is not just no present action, but also no impulse towards action in any conceivable form, including mentally, then can it still be called "fear" even though the same sense of being under threat remains? 

    (Same for any other unwholesome state).

    Complete freedom from fear does not mean the perception of a threat as a threat would not arise (which most people would tacitly assume is the problem and then try to mitigate and cover up). That significance and its pressure are in and of themselves not craving (see the quote from AN 6.55 given in the essay). 

    To know and see this clearly for oneself, one must acquire the Right View of a sotāpanna. It's the knowledge of the Four Noble Truths, and it's precisely why only a sotāpanna understands what an Arahant is and how to become one.

    >If he has completely let go of ownership of all assets (body and mental aspects), shouldn't that mean that he won't experience any threat even if his limbs are being cut off?

    The "assets" he has let go of are the five aggregates, which includes things like the perception of threat. And it's precisely due to that perception that he would be able to, for instance, refrain from casually putting his hand on a fire, walking into a precipice, or putting other people's lives in danger. The lack of fear is measured not by his being a robot that only experiences "bare" sense perceptions, but by how there would be no internal anguish when he realizes that he's be unable to avoid a threat (and unpleasant feeling in general). That's where the lack of ownership manifests. Thus, yes, he *experiences* no threat, but that doesn't mean the threat is not "there" at all (same as when the Suttas state that in Nibbāna nothing is felt; that doesn't mean an Arahant has no aggregate of feeling).

    >Or are you saying that his body would still trigger a threat/fear response, but his citta would be completely unmoved because it does not see that fear response as "mine"?

    You could say it that way (although you wouldn't call it "fear" if the citta is truly not moved), but it's important not to think that the intellectual understanding you may come to factually represents what an Arahant is. Without the Right View, that understanding will either assume that the Arahant still experiences things the way normal people do, which is certainly not true, *or* that Arahantship is measured by the aggregates being a certain way, which is equally not true. These are the two extremes that need to be transcended.

    >Broken away, unyoked, and liberated from form, the Tathagata dwells with an unrestricted mind (citta). Broken away, unyoked, and liberated  from feeling… Broken away, unyoked, and liberated  from perception… Broken away, unyoked, and liberated  from activities… Broken away, unyoked, and liberated  from consciousness… Broken away, unyoked, and liberated  from birth… Broken away, unyoked, and liberated  from aging… Broken away, unyoked, and liberated  from death… Broken away, unyoked, and liberated  from suffering… Broken away, unyoked, and liberated  from defilements, the Tathagata dwells with unrestricted mind.

    >Just as a red, blue, or white lotus born in the water and growing in the water, rises up above the water and **stands with no water adhering to it**, in the same way the Tathagata—broken away, unyoked, and liberated from these ten things—dwells with unrestricted mind.

    In such situations it's almost always best to avoid proselytizing. A person can only heed admonition or advice if they're already willing to admit that they're making a mistake, and you can't ultimately force someone else into that admission. It has to come from their end.

    What you do have make sure, if you value the practice and developing your mind, is that you don't end up letting their behavior derail *your* determination to be virtuous, even if that ends up impairing the relationship.

    The issue might be that you're trying to understand and practice the Middle Way on the very acute level of thoughts without having sufficiently developed the necessary prerequisites. That's the main reason why people are not able to help but fall into either indulgence or denial in their attitude towards their experience even if they have all the right information.

    So the way to make sure that you don't end up with a coping mechanism would be to focus on whichever stage of the Gradual Training you haven't fully completed instead of directly trying to approach these much subtler aspects of freedom from craving, and just stop worrying about those for the time being.

    It's not uncommon for people to be virtuous, restrained, and withdrawn from unwholesome things *because* of their intense craving to become enlightened that they're hardly aware of (that's the driving force behind most of those temporary meditation retreats people do), and for as long as that *other* desire is what's keeping your actions in check, you won't actually be able to become enlightened (not in the way that matters at least). You need to get to the point where virtue and restraint have become your default *regardless* of your craving to understand the Dhamma in order for any attempts to see it to be fruitful.

    Then you will have a basis that is actually "clean", and it becomes a matter of dealing with the residues and subtler defilements, instead of your practice top-to-bottom still being driven by passion as it is for most people. That is why the training has to be step-by-step: each next step can only be properly developed once the previous one is effortless and doesn't require craving and ambition to sustain anymore. Each "layer" [becomes an "aggregate",](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn27#mn27:14.4) i.e. something that's been built up beforehand and is now there on its own.

    >Isn't Citta part of the All? I understand (maybe wrongly) that the training is about taming Citta in regards to the All, but if this is the All, it must encompass Citta, right? and then taming Citta would be looking for a particular setting of the All.

    From the ultimate point of view, yes, of course, nothing can be outside of the All. But you never tame the citta by *trying* to make it calm down directly; that will always entail aversion to a feeling that has arisen on its own and will give rise to the calm of *management*. Instead, you tame it properly by completely abandoning any resistance against the presently arisen states as they are, any tendency to either accept them or interfere with them. And that definitely does give rise to peace (a feeling, which of course has to be within the All) that wasn't there before, but it's not a peace from *replacing* *and obscuring* what was bothering you, which is how it usually goes. It exists in its own domain simultaneously with the disturbances ([AN 9.42](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an9.42): "opening amidst confinement"). Sometimes the Buddha would use the metaphor of water drops sliding off a lotus. They cannot "stick".

    >2) I can find myself troubled by the same state of the famous example from Ajahn Nyanamoli, namely thinking "Did he mean this?" after someone said or did something. And when aware of that state I'm trying to control it and stop it "I shouldn't worry or doubt like that, the mind shouldn't proliferate like that".

    >When already engaged in proliferation, instead of trying to gain control over the situation, should one rather just observe the phenomena happening while knowing they are there because there is a body/mind there making it possible for them to be there, and enduring this context while the phenomena continues? I find that it is helping putting some distance with what is happening closely but I guess at times I'm doing it in the hope that I can get an unified mind back and that's probably where the issue lies.

    Yes, what you should do is make the effort to recognize that you're suffering because you have this vague need to act with or against the doubt in *some way,* and that's your craving in relation to a feeling that arose on its own. So you remind yourself that the displeasure you feel there is not the issue, but rather the ignorance and lack of perspective that makes you blame it for your suffering. Recollecting the body as the simultaneous, necessary foundation of that unpleasant experience would be one way to keep yourself from acting both out of it and against it.

    >My bad you probable meant taking them as "me, mine, myself" instead of accepting they are there and that it is fine as it is

    "Not accepting" an arisen state simply means not doing what your craving inclines towards: indulging in it when it's pleasant, resisting it when it's unpleasant, and distracting yourself when it's neither.

### Mind is the maker of all things ?

After watching this [short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YndVvyOcymQ) about the first Dhammapada verse from HH, it got me wondering.

Indeed my whole experience, my whole world, is nested in the mind, requires the mind and is experienced through the mind. In this way we could say mind comes first. Yet, HH also insists (and this is also found everywhere in the suttas) on the fact that the body comes first, that we need to discern this right order.

Both assertions makes sense to me. I experience this whole world in my mind, thanks to my mind and I'm subjected to it. But my mind is seated in a body (the contained one) that I can only experience thanks to a body (the container one) which is already there and that I can only infer. So in that way, the body as a container/peripheral definitely comes first and the mind comes second, and the experience of the body that I am familiar with (the one I perceive thanks to my senses), occurs in truth solely in my mind. Would that be a correct understanding ?

In fewer words : 

"that body because of which" > Mind (mano/citta/6sb?) > the world and the perceived body

    >But my mind is seated in a body (the contained one) that I can only experience thanks to a body (the container one) which is already there and that I can only infer.

Would that be a correct understanding ?

    Not quite. Through this you would be conceiving "the body because of which", the one that doesn't appear to your senses, as something that exists independently "out there" (the assumption of the outside world that is inherent to self view). It does appear to your sixth sense, no matter how vaguely, otherwise you couldn't talk about it.

    Your mind is not "in" your body. Rather, the mind is that because of which you are able to hold any views, right or wrong, about where the mind is. It cannot be located in space.

    Ultimately, you cannot build a neat theoretical framework that establishes either of the two as more primordial (in which case you could take that one as self), and that's fine because that's never the purpose of the Dhamma, which is easy to overlook in the process of trying to understand it.

    The purpose of the Dhamma is to uproot passion and appropriation: if you incline towards taking your body as yours, you realize that it's impossible to have even the faintest recognition of that body if there were not a mind (that cannot be contained within it) allowing you to think about it. If you incline towards taking the mind as yours, you realize that without a body, there would be no mind. Even if that mind is not strictly "in" the body, it certainly cannot exist without it. Because, how would you be able to talk about "a mind" unless sights, sounds, smells, tastes, touches, and ideas are somehow involved? All of these, including ideas, are fundamentally bodily.

    See SN 12.62 and [SN 12.67](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=sn12.67).

    The mind is not the brain, otherwise freedom from craving, and even freedom of choice, would not be possible. I've just finished writing an essay on this which should be published soon.

    "Bodily" (or, more accurately, bound up with the body) is not the same as "material", which is an important distinction to make, and it's why the sixth sense base is also part of the body (SN2.26: the whole world is within this fathom-long carcass endowed with perception and mind). For us in this realm, the body is physical, and we have to start with what we have, which is a physical body that depends on coarse physical food. Only by understanding that and abandoning passion towards it would it become concretely apparent how there can be types of body that are not as coarse as what we're used to (this is implied in the Sutta you mention).

    Even in the subtler realms you refer to, there has to be a "body" in the sense of something that is there, arisen on it's own, upon which consciousness stands and upon which it makes kamma, even if its purely perceptions and feelings. The relationship between "body" and "mind" (which are loose terms and not the way they're used in the Suttas) is the relationship between *namarūpa* and *viṅṅāṇa*, said to be like two sticks standing upon each other in [SN 12.67](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=sn12.67).

### Withdrawal of Life Support equivalent to killing?

[deleted]

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1ckuulb/withdrawal_of_life_support_equivalent_to_killing/l2s4htk/)** _2024-05-06 03:15:10:

    Sorry to hear about the situation.

    Yes. Although not as weighty as violent murder, of course, intentionally withdrawing life support would be killing. The bottom-line is that it's entirely unjustified to assume that a living being is in more pain when they're in a critical condition than when they're undergoing the final process of death. When the Buddha wanted to emphasize the severity of a certain feeling, he always used the expression "*dukkha* like that of dying".

    Even the most acutely painful *sensations* that you can conceivably experience with your still-functional nervous system cannot compare with the mental anguish of undergoing the actual breakup of the body and aggregates (which could last a long time). People who commit suicide invariably end up regretting it, because they realize death is not as quick and simple of an affair as they assumed it to be.

    So you absolutely never want your volition to be directly responsible for another living being having to undergo that experience sooner rather than later. But people, as usual, have a tendency to act out of how *they* feel on an immediate level on account of seeing their loved one in pain, and have a hard time enduring that and maintaining a broader perspective.

    >It’s either he doesn’t go on at all, or stays on until the end, (or the doctors remove him without my consent).

    In terms of your kamma, neither of them would involve killing. Of course, if you had a realistic and feasible opportunity to save someone's life and deliberately chose to abstain, that could still be unwholesome kamma, but at worst it would count as an act of severe negligence, not outright taking of a life.

    In this case, from what you say, there seems to be somewhat of a grey area when it comes to your responsibility. But the fact that you already know in advance that the doctors might be the ones playing god out of a legal obligation if you take that route would be one point in favor of not choosing it.

### MN20 and management

Hello,

are the 5 ways of making detrimental thoughts subsides presented in [MN20](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn20) considered 'management', or are they 'seeing and applying the middle way'?

Is 'management' as presented by HH only talking about management of perceptions, or is this type of 'mind inclinations/proliferation management' included in it?

&#x200B;

Edit: not sure why this HH picture is displayed here

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1ckqai5/mn20_and_management/l2s0qus/)** _2024-05-06 02:45:07:

    Management is not solely determined by *what* you do but also by *how* and *why* you do it. Anything, even an attempt to "endure" instead of "manage", can become management based on one factor: are you trying to change what you're feeling?

    Being clear about when such an intention arises (which could be at any time, even though the contemplation has not changed) is how you would indirectly notice the tendency to "manage", not by simply asking yourself whether you're "managing" or not (because at first glance you will always think you aren't, so that's not a reliable criterion).

    The purpose of these five strategies is to help you abandon the thoughts (i.e., mental *actions*) that are rooted in craving in regard to what you feel and perceive, not to replace what you feel and perceive altogether. That's why after each instruction it says the mind becomes "settled, unified, and composed *internally"*, i.e., it has become dispassionate towards the *same* feelings and perceptions that it previously could not help but to take personally. The lack of disturbance didn't come from conjuring up different feelings and perceptions that you happen not to be bothered by (which would be management).

    And, again, that is why right development of mind *cannot* take place without unbroken virtue established beforehand. For a mind that cannot help but to act by body and speech when presented with acute pleasure and displeasure, the only way to be at peace is to not have that pleasure and displeasure arise *at all* anymore, so the underlying tendency for management (which will never be obvious to them; that's precisely why they remain a victim to it) would be inescapable, even if the person does their absolute best to adhere to all of what I just wrote.

    >And so, in a way, one is acting out of feelings and perceptions because one first have to recognize these feelings and perceptions (signs of the mind) and then have to want to stop them

    No, you don't need to think of it as "stopping" feelings and perceptions. Think of it simply as stopping your wrong *attitude* in regard to feelings and perceptions, undermining your passionate, averse, or distracted involvement with them while they remain.

    In *cittānupassanā*, knowing a passionate mind as passionate mind, averse mind as averse mind, etc., is the "solution", by which one abides "disengaged, not taking up anything in the world". There's no second step of "dealing" with it once you know it properly.

    These 5 strategies are for exactly the same purpose, because it's always your unwholesome thinking within the state of mind that's the core issue; the state of mind itself  is not in your control and will calm down on its own if you just endure it and stop acting out of it. But you don't put the emphasis on the hope that it calms down (in which case you'll be trying to manage it), but rather in the knowledge that even if it endures for a thousand years, you are doing all that needs to be done by simply not indulging and not resisting either.

    Only then, when you are not giving in to it *nor* do you really care whether it calms down or not, will it actually calm down in the right way (because *you* gave up the craving that was nourishing it completely).

    >So, a passionate mind will by default always have the tendancy to grasp to the signs and features related to passion, overly attend to them instead of just keeping them at the peripheral of the perception, that is what is pointed to by the term "unwholesome thinking", right? And one recognizing this pattern correct this grasping by applying these 5 strategies?

    The passionate mind will be *trying* to coerce you to grasp the signs and features conducive to more passion by actively taking them up with your thoughts, but you can always refrain from accepting because it involves your volition, and that's all that matters.

    It basically comes down to distinguishing a *vitakka* or "thought" (the operative word in the Sutta) which refers to your active, intentional engagement, and a *dhamma* or phenomenon, which is what has arisen on its own (mental state, pressure, feeling, and even specific images, memories, concepts, ideas, etc.). These five strategies are to dispel the former, not the latter.

    >Now you mentioned that knowing a passionate mind is the solution for not having to deal with it, does that mean that one have to apply these 5 strategies only when already overly attending to signs and features, but one who recognized the state of mind before overly attending to those, or even after having successfully disengaged this attitude, doesn't need to "deal with it" anymore because he will not allow the grasping to occur in the first place?

    Broadly speaking yes, as the Sutta says, you implement the strategies when you recognize that *thoughts/vitakka* of desire, aversion, and distraction are starting to take over (i.e., *you* are mentally acting out of what has arisen). If you succeed in abandoning those thoughts, then what you're left with is simply knowing passionate mind as passionate mind, averse mind as averse mind, etc. There will still be thoughts about this, that, and the other, but the difference is they will no longer be *rooted in* the pressure of the mental state that's still there.

    Then you just stay with that and make sure not to "overdo" it (try to get rid of the mental state) nor "underdo" it (lose the restraint and start thinking unwholesome thoughts again), and at some point even that mental state will calm down.

    >Once one is able to properly recognize the state of mind and also to properly not grasp at the signs and features, without underdoing it or overdoing it, will the remaining work be clear and known without instructions?

    No. "Properly" is always relative, and you have no way to know in advance how long you have to keep working and adjusting until you reach the necessary degree of "properly".

### Jhana

Siddhartha prior to buddhahood trained all the way up to neither perception nor non perception. Still not being freed from suffering he went the way of the asetic. 
It's my understanding that to enter jhana one would have been freed from sensual desire since abandonment of sense desire and seclusion is what jhana is. If this is case, why did he go the asetic route if he had already surmounted sense desire? 
What am I missing here?

Grateful to anyone who takes the time to reply, and am very grateful for hermatige making the teachings public.

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1cirx6i/jhana/l2cqcjb/)** _2024-05-03 04:29:07:

    >It's my understanding that to enter jhana one would have been freed from sensual desire since abandonment of sense desire and seclusion is what jhana is.

    You don't have to be permanently free from sensual desire in order to enter jhāna.

    The requirement is that the  perception of danger in sensuality [be solidified ](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an6.73)to the point where, *at that time* at least, your mind has no interest whatsoever in sensual pleasures of the past, present, or future ([while you're still perfectly aware of the five senses](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an9.42#an9.42:3.2-an9.42:4.2) and have not repressed your thinking; otherwise it doesn't count).

    >If this is case, why did he go the asetic route if he had already surmounted sense desire?

    Without wisdom and external instruction, if you didn't clearly understand how vital the bodily and mental withdrawal from sensuality was to get you to that point, you might not prioritize that sufficiently from then onwards, and might think that the "experience" of jhāna arose due to something else (and that could happen even if you've received instruction, let alone if you haven't). Hence you wouldn't get it again.

    Of course, he did eventually become an ascetic and even then he wasn't getting jhāna, and that's because external renunciation is only a prerequisite: the Middle Way is subtle and very easy to overlook; it's not as easy as focusing on an object or engaging in a repetitive contemplation until a pleasant sensation suddenly arises.

    There is no way to know in advance because the defilements are not things that can be measured ([simile of the adze handle](https://suttacentral.net/sn22.101/en/sujato)). If the defilements were to be in the *way* sense objects arise for you, as it's often thought, then they would be measurable.

    It's not even necessary to get to a certain jhāna; even the first one is enough, as shown by many Suttas. You would know you have practiced it sufficiently when despite having no samādhi, your mind is incapable of intentionally welcoming sensuality no matter how strongly it suggests itself—the understanding of its gratification, danger, and escape has been irreversibly cemented. Just like a man would refuse any attempt to be thrown into a charcoal pit, as the simile goes, you wouldn't even need to tell your mind to not delight in sense pleasures.

### Right Disgust - why disgust can be practiced directly as an antidote and Metta cannot?

While watching the recent [Right Disgust video ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqSaMcuy2kI) I couldn't help wondering why Ajahn recommends using Asubha as a direct practice to counter lust, but many times advised against treating Metta as anything other than lack of aversion (so something purely negative). 
Also, contrary to statements made in the video on Asubha being practiced concurrently with desire being present, Bhikkhu Anigha made the following point in "Pervading the World with Friendliness":

"The Buddha therefore instructs that one should practice mettā only after the mind is already not overcome by ill will."

It would be consistent to treat Metta the same way - as an antidote to Dosa, just as Asubha is practiced as an antidote to Lobha.


Edit: Also, in more practical terms - just like a specific perception was discussed to counter lust towards the food, what would be an analogous perception to counter aversion, eg to specific people?

Thank you.

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1ci0ap8/right_disgust_why_disgust_can_be_practiced/l27cvmg/)** _2024-05-02 05:10:50:

    >It would be consistent to treat Metta the same way - as an antidote to Dosa, just as Asubha is practiced as an antidote to Lobha.

    At no point did he say nor imply that asubha is an "antidote". Throughout the video, he makes sure to emphasize that the perception of disgust must not be misconceived as a tool to get rid of the pressure and significance of the beautiful things, which is what we tend to call "replacing" or "antidoting".

    Mettā should be practiced in exactly the same way: you're not in any way trying to remove the unpleasant pressure of annoyance that has arisen in regard to someone—[that can go on forever ](https://youtu.be/sqSaMcuy2kI?si=-Ezk8eNybvCeVrLY&t=951)if it wants because it's not the issue. You simply maintain a context of non-hate *despite* that displeasure.

    In contrast to this, the typical way of practicing mettā goes overboard and tries make that displeasure disappear altogether (implying a wrong view that that's what ill will is), in the same way as asubha would be misused to *replace* the significance of beauty. That's what an "antidote" is, and it's not the Middle Way.

    >Bhikkhu Anigha made the following point in "Pervading the World with Friendliness":

    >"The Buddha therefore instructs that one should practice mettā only after the mind is already not overcome by ill will."

    See the line that comes right afterwards:

    >The mind first needs to be able to remain steady all by itself **when encountering things that challenge it**, instead of needing to use mettā or any other form of meditation as an aid to ameliorate such things.

    The point is exactly the same as the one made in the Right Disgust video. You need to be able to have the pressure present without your mind impulsively needing to *do* something about it right away, including "antidote" it (which is why the practice never starts with meditation, be it asubha or mettā, but with virtue and sense restraint; otherwise, everything you do will be superficial management). That's why I wrote "**not overcome** by ill will" and not "**free from** ill will".

    >Also, in more practical terms - just like a specific perception was discussed to counter lust towards the food, what would be an analogous perception to counter aversion, eg to specific people?

    Well, firstly the example of the food was figurative. It was said with reference to pleasant sense objects in general, not in the sense that you should literally imagine someone spat on your food in order to give up lust for it (that would become a quintessential form of misguided management, and soon enough would become ineffective).

    A perception that "counters" aversion could just be a simple recognition that not everything about the person your mind hates is bad. But, again,  the caveat is you must not be trying to override the pressure and annoyance that arose, thinking that mettā is about *liking* the person. It's not; it's about not hating people even when they cause you immense displeasure (inasmuch as asubha is not about hating pleasant things).

    And that's why *any* perception would indirectly develop mettā, such as the context of the body enduring behind that experience of anger, or even [taking the mood of anger itself as the context](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn10#mn10:34.4-mn10:34.5). Basically anything that prevents you from "taking up" the possibility of anger while it endures, even if its not the direct opposite of it (and the same applies with asubha). Otherwise, the Buddha would've said that you can only abandon lust and aversion by cultivating asubha and mettā respectively.

    Safety is found by making the mind completely immovable, not by dealing with the forces that attempt to move it.

    >And I'm not sure why that would be bad, if rather than compulsively it would be made to provide the correct perception, to course-correct wrong view noticed in regards to some specific food.

    Because it would be totally fabricated, and it would imply that the lust was somehow "in" the food.

    An example of right perception in regard to food would be the [simile of the child's flesh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmYzJSvZ5jE), which the Buddha himself suggested. With that, you wouldn't be trying to alter the perception of the food itself, but the whole context and motivation behind eating.

    You could also contemplate how the food will ultimately end up when you eat it, but again, that would be on the level of the broader context of eating, not directed *at the loaf of bread* or whatever.

### Additional Training Rules

Hi everyone,

About twelve years ago I experimented with the Bodhicari precepts of the Kendall Buddhist group. In essence, these were additional training rules meant to help deepen one’s practice. 

I have added some of these to the eight precepts and come up with the following fourteen precepts. (See below). 

My question is this: do you believe this will be helpful? 

Do you think it will actually be a hindrance?

1)Pāṇātipātā veramaṇī‧sikkhāpadaṃ samādiyāmi.
I undertake the precept to refrain from destroying living beings. 

2)Adinnādānā veramaṇī‧sikkhāpadaṃ samādiyāmi.
I undertake the precept to refrain from taking that which is not given. 

3)Abrahmacariyā veramaṇī‧sikkhāpadaṃ samādiyāmi.
I undertake the precept to refrain from sexual activity. 

4)Musāvādā veramaṇī‧sikkhāpadaṃ samādiyāmi.
I undertake the precept to refrain from false and incorrect speech. 

5)Pisuṇāvācā veramaṇī‧sikkhāpadaṃ samādiyāmiI undertake the Precept to refrain from backbiting. 

6)Pharusāyavācā veramaṇī‧sikkhāpadaṃ samādiyāmi. I undertake the Precept to refrain from using harsh or abusive speech. 

7)Samphappalāpā veramaṇī‧sikkhāpadaṃ samādiyāmi. I undertake the Precept to refrain from useless or meaningless conversation

8)Surā‧meraya‧majja‧pamādaṭṭhānā veramaṇī‧sikkhāpadaṃ samādiyāmi.
I undertake the precept to refrain from intoxicating drink and drug. 

9)Vikāla‧bhojanā veramaṇī‧sikkhāpadaṃ samādiyāmi.
I undertake the precept to refrain from eating at the wrong time. 

10)Nacca‧gīta‧vādita‧visūka‧dassana‧mālā‧gandha‧vilepana‧dhāraṇa‧maṇḍana‧vibhūsanaṭṭhānā veramaṇī‧sikkhāpadaṃ samādiyāmi. 
I undertake the precept to refrain from dancing, singing, music, going to see entertainments, wearing garlands, using perfumes, and beautifying the body with cosmetics.

11)Uccā‧sayana‧mahā‧sayanā veramaṇī‧sikkhāpadaṃ samādiyāmi
I undertake the precept to refrain from sitting or lying on high and luxurious seats and beds. 
12)Micchājīvā veramaṇī‧sikkhāpadaṃ samādiyāmiI undertake the Precept to refrain from wrong means of livelihood

13)Yāvajivam aham ratanattayam na niggahissāmi tatheva tam samādarena garukaram karissāmiti sikkhāpadaṃ samādiyāmi. I undertake the Precept not to revile the Three Treasures [the Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha] but to cherish and uphold them. 

14)Karunupāya kosalla pariggahitānam dasapāraminam paripurana sikkhāpadaṃ samādiyāmiI undertake the Precept to practise the Ten Perfections with compassion and skill. 

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1ch2tr3/additional_training_rules/l22csic/)** _2024-05-01 08:22:01:

    The precepts on speech and livelihood should certainly be taken along with the standard 8 always. In particular, the abstinence from frivolous speech is one that deserves a lot of attention, since it's one that would train you to become very aware of the intentions behind your actions on the domain that's most proximate to the mind (speech) and is thus easier to overlook, while all the others apply to more obvious bodily intentions (or are easy to superficially emulate without any discernment of the underlying motivation, e.g., by always speaking with a tender tone, "non-violent communication", etc.).

    >14)Karunupāya kosalla pariggahitānam dasapāraminam paripurana sikkhāpadaṃ samādiyāmiI undertake the Precept to practise the Ten Perfections with compassion and skill.

    This one however should not be made into a "precept" as such, since the 10 perfections (if we just take each of them individually based on their connotations in the Suttas and not later traditions) are things that are entirely dependent on your discernment, and they cannot just be "performed" by anyone in a straightforward manner like the actual precepts can (not properly, at least). There's no rigid standard by which adherence to them can be judged, and that's why such things never come under the heading of virtue and precepts in the Suttas.

    Virtue is not about the things you *do*, but the things you *don't* do.
- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1ch2tr3/additional_training_rules/l273hka/)** _2024-05-02 03:47:02 *(in reply to a comment not included)*:

    Sure, but there is a big difference between someone who does those "positive" actions *through* the context of permanently and completely abstaining from their opposites (which is the most important part), and someone who emphasizes doing the positive ones more than the abstinence. The latter may make you merit, but it doesn't develop your mind (which is the point of virtue first and foremost; helping the world is secondary), and there's a natural tendency in people to want to "compensate" for the occasional negative action with more positive actions, which is not how it works.

    The virtuous person who has put the abstinence first wouldn't feel a need to do the "good" things out of pressure and lack of confidence, so they would do them only in scenarios where they are genuinely wholesome (as opposed to only meritorious, which is not the same).

    Also, the last two contain a slight but significant distortion. The Pāli doesn't say he ***only*** speaks words that are conducive to concord, and ***only*** speaks gently. This is explained in MN 58.

    >Could you say what an undistorted translation would be, Bhante?

    Basically just remove the "only". Point being, one should adhere to that type of speech as the default. And even when you do speak in a way that *could* divide others or may be perceived as harsh, it should never be because you *want* to cause division and offend people, but because there is a greater purpose related to Dhamma that otherwise is likely to not be achieved (which is why you find the Buddha both turning people away from their former teachers and using not-so-gentle language at times)

    (And if malicious intentions to divide others or to offend do arise internally, one should reconsider whether one has sufficiently understood the Dhamma one is promulgating).

### What about the so called "arupa jhanas"?

I'm talking about the dimension of infinite consciousness, of nothingness, of neither perception nor not perception etc. What is HH stance on these things? I'm asking because it seems that these things are very important according to some suttas, and, at the same time, I personally wasn't able to find any talk about the "arupas".

I'm also wandering if they are connected with modern meditation techniques. For example, Ajahn Brahm teaches a kind of meditation where a practitioner loses the perception of the body, 5 senses (he excludes the 6 sense for some reason) etc., which sounds similar to the two latter "arupa jhanas".

Thanks.

    >I personally wasn't able to find any talk about the "arupas".

    There's a few talks that briefly touch upon the subject (such as [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdob2Ww6d-Y&list=PLUPMn2PfEqIwUiJG9Zy7S-89Twlw48qD1&index=18)), but it's not emphasized because for nearly all viewers it will only amount to abstract information that they're in no position yet to apply.

    Most definitely not. The ārupa attainments (they're not "jhānas") come about through developing the same principle as the 4 jhānas but on an even subtler plane (where, indeed, you wouldn't be perceiving objects of the five senses, but for the complete opposite reason of being "absorbed" or "concentrated"; instead, you *widened* your perspective and context way past that domain). Hence it's even more impossible for a person to attain any of those states "accidentally" or through a meditation technique, and they will remain completely out of reach just like the jhānas if one hasn't fulfilled the previous steps of the Gradual Training to a T. As shown by MN 106, it all invariably starts with the abandonment of sensuality and the world.

    They're not "progressive" in nature. The formless attainments can be had without passing through the jhānas, as shown in Suttas like MN 121.

He didn't resort to remembering his practice of arupa attainments, memories of which certainly were way more vivid. What's so liberative in jhanas but not in arupa attainments if they both use the same principle? Thanks.

    One significant reason would be that the formless attainments do not involve pleasure. It was therefore possible for the bodhisatta to maintain his old view that all pleasure is unwholesome, even though technically his mind was developed in subtlety even beyond the jhānas. Developing one's mind is a precondition for purification of one's views, but it's not automatic.

    But he did have enough discernment by that point to realize that the pleasure he experienced as a child from the first jhāna was not in fact unwholesome, and that brought him to recognize the Middle Way, i.e., change his view, and then basically start working his way up from the right starting point.

### Pabhasara Sutta

 [AN 1.51–60: Accharāsaṅghātavagga—Thanissaro Bhikkhu (suttacentral.net)](https://suttacentral.net/an1.51-60/en/thanissaro?lang=en&reference=none&highlight=false)   


" “Luminous, monks, is the mind. And it is defiled by incoming defilements. "

How much of this is to be understood as it says above? There are various discussions regarding this sutta and I'am curious to know how the Bhikkhu's of HH will interpret this sutta. 

Is the mind really Luminous originally or primordially? With right view and sila do we make it from Un-luminous to luminous again?

Or it's always been full of defilements and when we practice right view and sila we make it luminous as we go?

Would love to see how HH Bhikku's view this even if it's an explanation in brief.

&#x200B;

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1cf8619/pabhasara_sutta/l1qrzq6/)** _2024-04-29 04:36:41:

    The most practical implication of this Sutta is that whatever practices revolve around "fabricating" wholesome states (as [mettā](https://www.hillsidehermitage.org/pervading-the-world-with-friendliness/) tends to be practiced) are inherently misguided. You would only do that if you don't understand that the wholesome states are being *obstructed* by the defilements (because you fundamentally don't understand what the defilements are) and all you need to do is uncover them by removing the defilements.

    Hence the same Sutta says:

    >The uninstructed ordinary person doesn’t discern that as it actually is present, which is why I tell you that—for the uninstructed ordinary person—**there is no development of the mind**.”

    It's like if there's some external dirt covering a light bulb and making it dimmer than it should be, and instead of just cleaning up the dirt, you try to turn up the voltage to make the light brighter. No matter how much you do that, it will never shine like a clean bulb would (with much less strain). And that's why there can be no right meditation without the right view.

    Now, that doesn't mean that we're "already enlightened" and so on. It takes years of thorough virtue, restraint, seclusion, and constant questioning and upgrading of one's views to recognize how to actually wipe the dirt off the light bulb (=become a sotāpanna), and there is no way to bypass those prerequisites.

    [This talk ](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=GWJHdJmjmhE)also addresses this Sutta.

### Wrong Speech and Therapy

Hi everyone,

I have been having disagreements with my wife for some time. During the course of the marriage we have had counseling separately and individually as well as having spoken to our friends about our issues. 

It now occurs to me that most of the talking in these settings were forms of grievance and expressions of resentment. It seems that talk therapy is uniquely conducive to speaking out of ignorance, desire and aversion. So much so that I am contemplating never participating in it again. It also seems to me that workshopping relationship problems with friends odd equally unskillful. 

My question is this: is there ever a time when one wouldn’t be engaging in wrong speech by speaking with a therapist or friend about one’s relationship problems?

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1cf5jne/wrong_speech_and_therapy/l1qv4av/)** _2024-04-29 05:06:13:

    >is there ever a time when one wouldn’t be engaging in wrong speech by speaking with a therapist or friend about one’s relationship problems?

    It would depend on why you're trying to repair the relationship. If it's for some purely practical purpose, then you could regard the unwholesome states you're facing as not inevitable—as something that you could abandon internally while you still participate in the therapy.

    But if it's not out of practical considerations, and deep down you're doing it because you still want a good relationship with your wife ***as wife*** (at least emotionally), then there's nothing you can do internally to override the fact that you're *already* acting out of hindrances from the outset. The aversion and resentment you're experiencing are things that are already there, waiting to pounce, the very second pleasure of any kind becomes your motivation to act. That's one not-so-subtle form of ["Trojan horse".](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1cdklmr/comment/l1hyvqc/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

### 8 Precepts

Hello all,

I have been trying to perfect my practice of the eight precepts but I have some questions I would like to pose to the community. 

Due to my schedule it can be hard to get my eating in before solar noon. Provided I am limiting my eating to a certain time period (e.g. 11am to 7pm) would that be considered in keeping with the precept or should I train myself further until I can stop eating after noon?

In terms of deodorants and cologne, how strict should I be? I don’t want to come to work smelling badly but I kind of feel that I’m definitely not following the spirit of the precept. 

I have relatively little problem with the other precepts (although I have found myself singing along with my seven year old at times). 

I think I already know the answers to my questions but I would appreciate your comments. 

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1cecoat/8_precepts/l1hw6nz/)** _2024-04-27 13:16:15:

    >Due to my schedule it can be hard to get my eating in before solar noon. Provided I am limiting my eating to a certain time period (e.g. 11am to 7pm) would that be considered in keeping with the precept or should I train myself further until I can stop eating after noon?

    The precept on not eating after noon is basically the only one that does not *necessarily* have to involve craving when you break it (quite a while certainly passed before the Buddha[ instituted that rule for the monks](https://suttacentral.net/mn70/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=main&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin); eating after noon is not one of the [things an Arahant is incapable of](https://suttacentral.net/an9.7/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=main&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin)). But practically speaking, for a mind that is not free from sensual craving, it will be much easier to practice moderation in eating (i.e. the right context of the mere intention to survive and stay healthy instead of enjoyment) if you limit your intake to one meal, or perhaps two, and within a certain period of the day. 

    If for practical reasons you can't accomplish that before noon, it's fine. It's not like 12p.m. is a magical number; it probably had more to do with how meals would be prepared at people's houses in ancient India, the lack of refrigerators, etc.

    As for deodorants, even of the scented kind if nothing else is available, I wouldn't consider that a breach of the 7th precept if the intention behind it is simply to not smell bad as opposed to smelling good. Same with laundry detergents and so on.

    Until you're at least anāgāmi, it's much more important that you focus your effort on disregarding other people's expectations and social conventions when it comes to sensual, aversive, and distracting things (i.e., not just the actions against the 8 precepts but also pointless company, frivolous speech, etc.).

    >Although the Arahants may be capable of eating after noon, surely there would be some reason they would choose to abstain from it for life?

    Yes, but that's referring specifically to Arahants who were living at that time. They would abstain from it for life because the Buddha made the rule, and furthermore, since no Arahants are householders, the whole alms round situation means that eating at night would have a strong *correlation* with caring too much about food: you were willing to go through the trouble of walking around in a dark jungle, and let several hours of your day be spent on eating. Because eating at night would always have meant having *two completely separate meals* for them, not one.

    Eating in the morning is also just where things would naturally slant for someone who isn't overly concerned neither with food nor with other things that would make them need to uphold a specific schedule. Get it done as soon as possible and then forget about food (which you see more as a hassle than a source of pleasure) for the rest of the day.

    >Would a sick arahant with an illness requiring food in the evening for strength simply abstain out of respect for the rule?

    Most likely yes, though it would also depend on the individual and the overall situation. Even if they could do it without any defilement, it's not worth setting a precedent of disregarding rules for others that might look up to them just to prevent some discomfort, or even death. Others may then be inclined to think it's OK to break rules when it's "necessary", and the criterion for "necessity" would sooner rather than later start to be arbitrarily decided, inevitably influenced by the ignorance and craving of the undeveloped mind.

    >surely that doesn't mean that the pleasant feeling (or any feeling) associated with an evening meal is by default unwholesome?

    No, but in their situation it probably was, because of what I mentioned above. And according to MN 66, the finest meals would be prepared at night, not during the day.

    And it's not saying that food entering your mouth during the night is inherently unwholesome regardless of the context surrounding it. It's that unwholesome qualities would tend to increase *as a result* of engaging with that pleasant feeling. Like spending most of your day in company instead of in seclusion.

### Vitakkasaṇṭhānasutta

Hi everyone,

My apologies if this has been covered already but I’m unable to find it in the search. I am of the impression that Right Endurance/Effort means that we don’t reject by moving towards or away from sense contacts but an still unsure of how that fits in with the advice given in the Vitakkasaṇṭhānasutta. 

What is meant by the simile of the peg? Of crushing with awareness? How are these not managing pressure already arisen?

Thank you all in advance. 

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1cdklmr/vitakkasaṇṭhānasutta/l1gicvt/)** _2024-04-27 04:23:57:

    >How are these not managing pressure already arisen?

    The main thing that must not be overlooked is the way that the Sutta starts:

    >“Bhikkhus, ***a bhikkhu committed to the higher mind*** should attend to five signs from time to time.

    The Buddha never told people to even attempt to practice the higher mind *before* they were established in the higher virtue, which is why all discourses on meditation the Buddha gave are addressed to monks, and a very scant few to *noble* lay disciples like Anāthapiṇḍika.

    Trying to purify unwholesome thoughts while there is still a willingness to break the 8 precepts is like meticulously guarding the gateway of a property that lacks an entire section of the surrounding fence. Even if your approach to guarding the gateway happens to be correct in its own right (i.e., you are not engaging in a meditation technique but are trying to follow what the Suttas say), the thieves already infiltrated the property a long time ago, and thus whatever you do at the gateway, no matter how skillful it is, is inevitably secondary and tangential (*i.e., management*).

    Or, to use [the Buddha's own simile](https://suttacentral.net/an3.101/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=main&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin), it's like putting gold ore—with stone, soil, gravel and all—directly into the crucible for melting, skipping the previous steps.

    You don't even need to have "plans" to break the precepts at any concrete point in time to have a defiled mind. Let's say you're too old to be interested in sensual pleasures so there's no real chance that you'd be seeking them: if you *could* be willing to engage if you were to suddenly regain your youth, that right there is the hindrance of sensual desire at full volume, so anything you do without addressing that (including the five strategies in this Sutta) is irrelevant to the root issue. It's an obvious indication that [the danger in sensuality has not been understood](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an6.73#an6.73:1.4-an6.73:1.5).

    So *that*'s the "thought of sensuality" that a person should be trying to get rid of first and foremost for all the rest to not be management. And you will know that you're actually "uprooting" instead of managing and covering up due to the uneasiness that would probably arise, and the fact that the mind does not want to even look in that direction.
- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1cdklmr/vitakkasaṇṭhānasutta/l1hyvqc/)** _2024-04-27 13:35:56 *(in reply to a comment not included)*:

    Since it seems you're already keeping the 8 precepts, there's another point that may be useful:

    As the [sense restraint formula](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn39#mn39:8.2-mn39:8.4) says, it's purpose is to prevent states of longing and aversion from "flowing in". As in, it's supposed to prevent you from ending up in the position where you would have to "apply" any of the 5 strategies in the first place. However, everyone will of course be making mistakes from time to time, and the coarse unwholesome thoughts will end up arising, which is why the Buddha gave the discourse.

    But it's important not to just stop at dealing with the thoughts (even if [rightly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Woq8vFgl2Rs)), and to also reflect on *why* you ended up having to deal with them in the first place: recall the points in the recent past where you yourself ended up "opening the door" for such things to infiltrate your mind, through little careless choices that at the time presented themselves as harmless (because they were not against the precepts for example), but were already subtly rooted in losing the context and grasping at unwholesome signs and features (even if not strictly for sensual reasons, it could be out of restlessness, distraction, indolence, irrational doubt, etc.)

    Those are the "Trojan horses" you would consciously allow free passage, which then make you end up having to deal with such intensified pressures to begin with.

### New Essay: Restraining the Senses



- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1cbpxdg/new_essay_restraining_the_senses/l16gqvr/)** _2024-04-25 10:14:08 *(in reply to a comment not included)*:

    >then your mind will still be liable to come to proliferate to the point of having the intention to lie at one point?

    No, it's more subtle than that.

    A better example would be celibacy, since sense restraint is primarily about lust and aversion. If you are not 100% sure that you will *never* engage in sexual activity no matter what, anything that you do when you encounter the signs and features that would incite those intentions (not just physically but mentally as well) would have to fall either onto the extreme of indulgence, or the extreme of management, such as doing asubha , watching your breath, contemplating the danger in sensuality, trying to "let go", etc., to *abolish* the enticing signs and features instead of simply *not grasping* at them. And that suppression equally entails a failure in sense restraint.

    The prerequisite for right samādhi is to be able to withstand the pressure of sense objects without managing them ([\[1\]](https://suttacentral.net/an5.113/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin) [\[2\]](https://suttacentral.net/an5.139/en/thanissaro?lang=en&reference=none&highlight=false)), and doing that without firmly established virtue will result in your bodily and verbal restraint crumbling. It doesn't count as a "firm establishment" if you still entertain even an ambiguous possibility of ever interrupting it, because nothing stops that possibility from actualizing when the pressure intensifies past a certain point, as it will.

    >When the wild elephant stands and sits when the trainer says, following instructions, the trainer sets the task called imperturbability. He fastens a large plank to its trunk; a lancer sits on its neck; other lancers surround it on all sides; and the trainer himself stands in front with a long lance. While practicing this task, it doesn’t budge its fore-feet or hind-feet, its fore-quarters or hind-quarters, its head, ears, tusks, tail, or trunk. The wild bull elephant endures being struck by spears, swords, arrows, and axes; it endures the thunder of the drums, kettledrums, horns, and cymbals. Rid of all crooks and flaws, and purged of defects, it is worthy of a king, fit to serve a king, and considered a factor of kingship.

    —MN 125

    >If it's so subtle, how can you ever reach the point of absolute 100% certainty? Especially with more subtle restraint breaking, like emotional eating or as suggested, telling a lie.

    I wasn't saying that the intention to break the restraint is subtle; it isn't. What I was referring to as subtle is the reasoning behind why a person must give up all possibilities of breaking the precepts in the future (assuming they want to achieve the joy and samādhi the Suttas actually talk about), and not just decide on a case-to-case basis or during a temporary retreat.

    With "100% sure" I didn't mean having no doubt you will never do it again (which would only be the case for an Arahant) but that you are at least 100% *determined* not to do it under any circumstances, as opposed to leaving it a tiny bit up in the air.

    (Incidentally, that's why it would be much better to take on the five precepts *forever* and with no exceptions whatsoever, than to take the 8 precepts 5 days a week and none on the other 2. It still wouldn't be enough for the first jhāna which is t[he pleasure of renunciation](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an9.41), but it would actually force the mind to grow instead of just being an empty observance or willpower exercise.)

    >Edit: I also don't see how keeping the 8 precepts is so different from sense restraint. You feel a pinch from a mosquito bite and restrain your hand from lashing out and restrain your intent to kill in the same way you see an attractive person coming in the distance and restrain your eye from looking and restrain your intent to look. Should I just as well look at attractive people coming in the distance, since my precepts aren't perfect?

    No, it doesn't mean that. What it means is that you should do basically all it takes to prevent yourself from breaking the precept or coming close to it, even if it means trying to get rid of the signs and features that you perceive (as opposed to just "not grasping" at them) by closing your eyes, pretending the person doesn't exist, focusing on your breath, or whatever. But you keep in perspective that that's *just virtue;* you're not developing anything more than that.

    If you keep that up consistently and long enough, even though it's not perfect in terms of the subtler planes of development, you'll eventually be able to impeccably keep all the precepts and you won't really feel the pressure to break them anymore. But you will still be *mentally* delighting in the sight of the attractive person more than you should, or denying it more than you should, and that's when you start worrying about sense restraint as such.

    A lot of people (even renunciates of other religions) do reach that point, but they typically fail to realize that that was just the *first step*, and they think it's just a matter of *continuing* to close their eyes, pretend things don't exist, focus on their breath, etc., twice as hard, and liberation will eventually "happen".

    >If I give the precept on harsh speech as an example and take that to mean not speaking out of anger (as opposed to simply not using curse words or coarse types of language) - how would I ever be able to know when I am keeping the precepts "impeccably", before becoming a Sotapanna and knowning unwholesome as it really is, and thus knowning exactly what wholesome behaviour would be?

    There is certainly further purification to be accomplished once you simply keep the rules, but that's not what I meant with "impeccably". If you take it in that ultimate sense, then yes, only a sotāpanna or higher can keep the precepts perfectly.

    >there will still be somewhat of a gray zone concerning where simply speaking WHILE feeling unpleasant becomes speaking out of aversion to an unpleasant experience? Where unpleasant feeling becomes irritation?.

    That's true, but you would never get to discern those subtler things if your effort hasn't graduated beyond the coarse keeping of the rules, which you do have to start with because anything more will be abstract initially. But it is a good point to keep in mind: the further stages of the Gradual Training, all the way to jhāna, are about cementing further what began with the precepts, not about building up something else as it's often thought.

    >How would I know that the lack of pressure is due to my virtue, and not due to my environment?

    Until your mind is actually free from the things that would make you break the virtue, the lack of pressure is inevitably due to your environment at least partially. Even for a householder, it will be because they encounter more or less the same things on a daily basis, so if suddenly they were to experience something extraordinary, the pressure would arise.

    That doesn't mean that the virtue is wrong, since virtue by itself (i.e. mere adherence to the rules) won't take you further than that. But it does mean that you shouldn't rest content with that lack of pressure even though it does count as progress, precisely because it's always somewhat circumstantial.

### comment on nanavira and the relevance of 'flux' to the buddha's path

thank you to u/Additional_Fix8417 for your comments in another post and pointing me to the below link by nanavira:

[https://nanavira.org/index.php/letters/post-sotapatti/1964/119-l-06-4-march-1964](https://nanavira.org/index.php/letters/post-sotapatti/1964/119-l-06-4-march-1964)

in this letter, nanavira argues against the notion of 'flux' as being relevant to the buddha's teachings. he comments:

>Perhaps you will be wondering why it is that I am so anxious to destroy the notion of flux—or at least to eliminate it from the context of the Dhamma

the below is a critique of that letter.

in summary, i believe nanavira's analysis confuses the knowability of the external sense object (or as i suggest, it's unknowability), and over-states the permanence of physicality, mind, and mental concepts. he accordingly incorrectly concludes that the notion of continuous change (flux) is irrelevant to the dhamma.

i have written this critique as a direct response to nanavira - if anyone wishes to follow, i'd recommend they read his letter first, or at least read it in parallel to the below. 

-----

you take issue with the notion of flux. i note that you take physical objects as your initial point of analysis, and i suspect that part of your issue with 'flux' lies with this initial point of departure. if on the other hand, we take the mind as that initial point of departure, we see that flux (change) persists continually, constantly, ceaselessly.

indeed, the buddha himself recignised this when he commented that the mind is far more changeable than the material aspects of the body to the extent that if one were to take aspects of being to be oneself, it would be more sensible to take the physical rather than the mental as the physical has at least the appearance of endurance and persistence.

>*It would be better, bhikkhus, for the uninstructed worldling to take as self this body composed of the four great elements rather than the mind.*   
*For what reason? Because this body composed of the four great elements is seen standing for one year, for two years, for three, four, five, or ten years, for twenty, thirty, forty, or fifty years, for a hundred years, or even longer.*   
*But that which is called ‘mind’ and ‘mentality’ and ‘consciousness’ arises as one thing and ceases as another by day and by night.*   
*Just as a monkey roaming through a forest grabs hold of one branch, lets that go and grabs another, then lets that go and grabs still another, so too that which is called ‘mind’ and ‘mentality’ and ‘consciousness’ arises as one thing and ceases as another by day and by night.*

[https://suttacentral.net/sn12.61/en/bodhi](https://suttacentral.net/sn12.61/en/bodhi?lang=en&reference=none&highlight=false)

indeed, in light of the buddha's words above i do not think your charge of the inappropriateness of flux in the dhamma holds firm.

you state that the idea of continuous change is not a matter of direct observation, and yet, would not the buddha's teaching of insight in vipassana be the very essence of direct observation of change?

even at the most surface of levels with dependent origination in the context of the five aggregates, one can directly see the arising and passing away of mental phenomena: contact and consciousness of a sense object, perception, and intentional mental actions. indeed, there is no mental phenomena that remain or endures in one's experience. from this perspective, i think your charge that continuous change is not a matter of observation does not hold true either.

i see that the reason you come to this view is that your origin is consideration of external form. taking the most extreme example, a diamond could be gazed at for a person's entire lifetime and no change whatsoever be seen. in this context you are correct that human (natural eye) observation cannot encompass all the change of the universe.

however, when we address these ideas through the buddha's teachings, it becomes clear that constant flux is actually present - just perhaps not in the way you have considered it.

within the buddha's theory there is the external sense object. there is contact with the sense base. sense consciousness arises - knowing of the contact. sensation with hedonic tone arises; perception; mental intentional action. as a result of this, the physical form is conditionally impacted as well.

a concrete example - a person walks into our view: there is contact of the visual sight with the eye; eye consciousness arises, and we know we have seen something; sensation (pleasant if there is a pleasing aspect to the sight) arises and we perceive / know the object (as perhaps a well-loved friend), from which intentional mental action arises. this process in turn conditions the body - perhaps pupillary dilation, or heart rate increase.

this process is clearly one that is constant change. we know this from our daily experience that this kind of flux of mental and physical aggregates is immediate, constant, and unceasing. this is just as the buddha states in the quote above.

in contrast, you are focusing on the knowability of the external sense object. within he buddha's thesis, this, to some extent is illusory. i'm in agreement that we can't truly know the instantaneous changes that are taking place in an external object. indeed, even science can't know that due the delay between measurement and knowing of that measurement.

however, this isn't the buddha's concern.

your argument regarding the statement 'this has changed' as implying sameness (this) and not-sameness (has changed) is an argument of conventional language, not of absolute truth. certainly, even the buddha used 'i' to denote his existence in the past. conventionally, we are referring to a constancy of process of change, and not necessarily that something remains the same.

i find your analysis of external sense objects lacking in this regard. when you speak of 'this leaf' or 'this tree', or 'mango', you are referring to linguistic concepts. at the language level, a mango is not a 'mango' to a culture that has never encountered them - it may perhaps be considered an odd sort of peach, or say in some theoretical civilisation that has no fruit trees, a 'stone'. 'mango' is a cultural-linguistic concept, and not a truly existent thing. so much for language and the linguistic modifiers we use to signify or conceptualise phenomena.

you say "consider a leaf that changes colour—first it is green, then when it dies it becomes brown, but it is still the same leaf". is it though? in what way is there any permanence to that leaf over it's lifetime. just because there is a verbal signifier 'that leaf', in what way is there any sameness? you say sameness of shape  but actually there is no leaf that retains 'sameness of shape' at all (especially given their emergence from embryonic form of seed or bud). perhaps this is just a poor example you have chosen to make a point.

your example of the perception of a spoon is likewise troubled:

>I fix my attention on the bowl of the spoon and see the handle less distinctly out at one side; then I fix my attention on the handle and see the bowl less distinctly out at the other side. The spoon, as a whole, remains unchanged—in both cases it is exactly the same spoon.

you are confusing the external sense object and the internal perception of that sense object. the spoon itself is unknowable in the true sense - we can never know the true quality or nature of the spoon. our knowledge of it is necessarily mediated through our sense-base and mental aggregates, and our past experience with such 'spoons'. and these are, as noted above, in constant flux - one moment, we think we are looking at a spoon; then next we consider it's just a very detailed drawing of a spoon; then our perception shifts and we suddenly realise it's not a spoon at all but an adeptly placed small metal mug. this is the process of perception - constant flux and updating of information and perception. you can easily experience this in viewing illusory phenomena:

[old woman or young girl illusion](https://www.cleareyes.com/sites/cleareyes/files/styles/large/public/2020-12/hill_illusion%20sml2.jpg?itok=QMz5bSiH)

you say the general features of an object always remain the same, and yet i don't think you realise how much of this is made up by your brain. for example, are you aware that we all have a blind spot in our vision - a gaping hole in the centre of our foveal vision, which the brain, miraculously, mends together for us. likewise, consider the room you are in with it's four straight walls and 90 degree corners. you may be surprised to learn that likely none of those corners are presenting to your eye at 90 degrees. your brain is simply interpreting them as so.

my point is that there are no "constant sensible qualities" of an external object that are perceived - the brain makes up a large part of your experience; a spoon is not a spoon ...

from the point of view of the mental processing of the external world, then, yes, indeed, things are in constant flux. if they were invariably constant according to the external world, we would all likely go mad - nothing would be predictable and our understanding of the world would be wildly inaccurate.

further, "same" and "different" are always relative then. same and different qualities of sense objects are necessarily dependent on the sense-base perceiving them, and that sense base is in constant flux. the pupil size changes, the angle of the head changes, our perception and recollection of phenomena changes. we say 'same' but there is no absoluteness in that statement whatsoever. that's an entire deception created by the mind. hence we mistake seeing a stranger for a friend, and old woman for a young girl, etc.

your very example of the sudden perception that "the curtains have faded" is a very example of the mind ignoring salient information until it becomes too obvious to ignore. thus, our ability to perceive flux in an external sense object has nothing to do with the reality of what is occurring. further, within the mind, i reiterate that there is constant flux of the mental aggregates arising and passing away instantaneously.

>The contradiction \[involved in the definition of flux or continuous change\] arises from failure to see that change at any given level of generality must be discontinuous and absolute, and that there must be different levels of generality. When these are taken together, any desired approximation to "continuous change" can be obtained without contradiction

surely, the inability in daily life to retain a single state of consciousness of a sense object, or a feeling, or a single perception, or an intentional thought, unchanged and unaltered, for even a single minute, is ample evidence of the discontinuity and absolute incessant change occurring instant to instant.

for the buddha, this process (dependent origination) is incessant. within samsara, there is only the possibility of prolonging a particular perception in jhana, which can result in rebirth in the insensible formless realms where one maintains a single percept for a period of time, before that percept passes away too.

in this context, i cannot understand you argument against the idea of flux in dependent origination.

alternatively, from what you say, you seem to imply that your objection the the use of the word 'flux' is a linguistic one - the connotation of flux as denoting a smooth transition, rather than continuous change. if that is what you mean, i can accept that, but i'd note that that is simply your verbal lingustic (and western cultural) interpretation of language. it's not an absolute, and it's not a genuine basis for an argument in this context. language is a culturally negotiated set of conventions. you are applying a western interpretation of language to an eastern framework of thought. if this is the basis of your objection to 'flux', then simply define your terms and renegotiate those meanings in the face of this novel cultural contact.

the buddha circumvents this argument. he speaks to the arising and passing away of phenomena in a dependent fashion. a phenomenon (e.g., sense contact) arises to a peak and then passes away, then conditioning the arising of another phenomenon (e.g., consciousness) arising to a peak and then falling away, etc. there is conditionality, but each individual phenomena arising and passing away has no intrinsic essence - it's constantly (and you will dislike this word) in flux. this absence of essence at this level of arising and passing away is anatta.

you seem to consider the possibility of this way of thinking about phenomena here:

>Perhaps, then, we are wrong in thinking that 'a continuous succession of changes' is the same as 'continuous change'. If these two are not the same, and 'continuous change' is the truth, then we must deny the existence of separate individual changes

however, it seems you are unable to accept this, as you subsequently reify this change by analysing it in terms of sections of a whole, but then contradictorily, refusing to allow change as occurring within each of those sections. it seems to me that your natural bent is towards reification and this is preventing you from seeing anatta.

i note that your comment that states of mind "do not come within the sphere of science" is limited by the science of your time. in modern science, mental states are clearly the purview of research and empirical elucidation. you note that your original correspondent does not appear to accept flux in mental state. i'm not sure why they would think that if they were educated in the buddha's teachings (perhaps they were not). however, on the basis of the above, i cannot understand how you can state that "the notion of flux cannot be applied to states of mind".

accordingly, your argument of "familiar" sense objects falls down: nothing is truly ever familiar, but the brain - falsely - makes up that familiarity. if that were not true, then what happens to one's brain would never impact the familiarity of objects. that's not the case, as dementia for example, makes things entirely unfamiliar, though they do not objectively change.

>You say 'The word flux means continuous change. If this idea is applied to everything it would be correct to say that what I see now, e.g. a tree, is not the same as I continue to watch it as it is subject to continuous change'

i cannot see why you consider this to be false? why is is incorrect to state that there is no intrinsic essence to conditioned phenomena? you can certainly state that there is no intrinsic essence to the mental processing of external sense objects. if you are referring to the truth / reality of external sense objects, independent of mental processing, this is irrelevant to buddhism. perhaps you are fixated on the 'truth' of the verbal linguistic label. however, even at the cultural level, the notion of 'tree' breaks down when analysed.

your objection to this way of understanding the buddha's teaching is that "it does not explain why what is impermanent is suffering, and what is suffering is not self".

however, the answer to that is quite clear: greed aversion and delusion arise as a result of ignorance of the true nature of phenomena. our mistaken assumptions of the permanence of phenomena, of the capacity of phenomena to satisfy us, and of an intrinsic essence to phenomena, are all false, and this false assumption leads us, invariably, into reliance on a false understanding of the world, and naturally, suffering.

seeing impermanence (or flux) is the first step to understanding that these phenomena have no true essence, and hence are unreliable for our happiness. impermanence (or flux) are integral to the initial step of realising the truth of the buddha's path:

    Sure, when you choose to zoom in on and overemphasize specific perceptions. But if there isn't *something* in your mind that's remaining the same throughout, how can you weave together words and paragraphs to convey a coherent message? If the entire mind is changing from moment to moment, you would forget what you're trying to write and would have to start afresh each new instant.

    >this, we’re not sustaining that theme for the whole period of time we’re writing - there are myriad incidental mental activities that are interspersed.

    Your direct attention will be shifting between different things, but the fact is that if there was no overarching theme of "I am writing an essay about X" enduring *uninterrupted* (not at the level of direct attention, but peripheral to it) for minutes or hours on end, there is no reason why your thoughts would remain "on topic" instead of shifting to something completely unrelated.

    That's why when you're walking, you can start to think about endless different things to the point where your attention is totally away from the individual movements of your legs, and yet you wouldn't stop walking. Your attention could be shifting a million times per second to this or that, and yet the intention to walk stays unchanged up until the moment where you actually stop walking.

    You can come up with an intricate system of rationalizations to argue that experience doesn't work in this way, but it will always continue to do so even while you deny it.

    >I’m not sure what you mean by ‘uninterrupted’. you acknowledge that the mental process is interrupted by various sense objects, related to and unrelated (is this what you mean by ‘peripheral’?) to the theme of consideration.

    The mental process is not "interrupted" by various sense objects. Rather, the sense objects are changing on a different, lower level than the overall intention to write an essay. A verbalized thought or image of "I want to write this essay" certainly has to give space to other thoughts in order to actually start coming up with ideas for the text, but the *overarching* attempt or intention to write an essay remains there. There is an *implicit (peripheral),* as opposed to explicit, awareness of "I am writing an essay", *without* it needing to be brought to the center of your attention.

    >i don’t see this as reflective of the necessity for a uniform, unchanging theme, but rather a reflection of the clinging and craving that’s associated with the sensation of a pleasurable mental sense object. as a result of that delight, the mind picks up and plays with, repeatedly, that mental sense object.

    So the Buddha was clinging and craving when he gave long discourses that revolved around one central theme, without changing subjects? You also stated before that jhāna is the only state where the mind sticks to one single object. Doesn't that imply that jhāna is a state of more craving and delight than non-jhāna?

    >however, sometimes the topic of thought we are dwelling on as we walk becomes so engrossing that we fail to monitor our walking and we may stumble or walk past our destination.

    Sure, but that was not the point. The point is that regardless of how engrossed you get, you don't actually *stop walking.* That means that there is a layer of your experience (*cetanā* to walk) that, until you stop walking, is *not* changing, no matter to what and how fast your attention shifts.

    If it does, then your definition of anattā is not in accordance with the Suttas. The Buddha said in his second discourse that things are anattā because [they cannot be fully controlled to our satisfaction](https://suttacentral.net/sn22.59/en/bodhi?lang=en&reference=bj&highlight=false), not because they have no "lasting identity". The Suttas quite clearly state that things do *endure,* and not only as an "illusion" of the ignorant mind, but for the Buddha himself, and his ability to see that is *praised*:

    >“Sir, **the Buddha** knows feelings as they arise, as they **remain**, and as they go away. He knows perceptions as they arise, as they **remain**, and as they go away. He knows thoughts as they arise, as they **remain**, and as they go away. This too I remember as an incredible and amazing quality of the Buddha.”

    —MN 123

    >Conditionality still remains.  

    "Conditionality" (*paṭiccasamuppāda)* is not about a process of momentary changes, an Abhidhammic idea that's utterly absent from the EBTs. It's about the fact that no matter how long any given thing lasts, there will *always* be something else that it depends on, the most fundamental being this fragile body remaining alive. That's why in [MN 38](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn38), the Buddha discusses dependent origination in terms of the *nutriment* of the things that have arisen, and makes it clear that passion is abandoned by recognizing that without the nutriment, the thing standing upon it cannot remain. That is why things are anicca, dukkha, and anattā; no moment-to-moment process is mentioned. 

    In the same vein, SN 12.67 compares "conditionality" to two sticks standing upon each other, such that if you take away any of them, the other cannot stand. Again, no mention of "moments".

    >Memory is being passed to the next moment.

    "Passed on" by what? The answer can only be: something that is remaining unaffected by the changes. And that "something", that background mental context, even though it can last for a long time, is not "eternal" or permanent at all: if you trip, hit your head, and become unconscious, which is totally possible the entire journey, you won't be able to walk nor even think about walking anymore.

    >Being subjected to change cannot be controlled to our satisfaction. Change is oppressive and often unwelcomed.

    Of course. Nobody is denying that things are subject to change*.* But saying that things are *subject* to change (*vipariṇāmadhamma*, mentioned repeatedly in the Suttas, including the Anattalakkhana I linked), and saying that things are *uninterruptedly* *changing,* with no duration in between, are earth and sky. 

    >If one posits a thesis of "*Identity that endures* \[for quite long time, sometimes\]" is that which is cut off, sounds like in Ucchedav*ā*da. IMHO. Please correct me if incorrect.

    You're confusing identity in the sense of a thing remaining the same throughout time, and the sense of self which, as always explained in the Suttas, comes down to *taking* things as "mine"*.* A thing remaining the same for however long does not force you to take it as "mine": even the most ignorant person in the world wouldn't automatically regard their neighbor's house as "mine" just because they see it as remaining the same for many years.

    The lack of understanding of how something (everything, in the end) will be suddenly ripped away from you *sometime* in the future, even if its billions of years later, means not seeing the peril of taking it as "mine", and that's why appropriation and the sense of self take place even though they're entirely mistaken. The change that will *eventually* happen to every phenomenon does not care at all about how attached you were to it. 

    In fact, the erroneous sense of "mine" develops from familiarity, which *requires* things to last for a while.

    >(*has moment of arising,* ***duration*** *and cessation*).

    You can't call it "momentary" and at the same time acknowledge that it has a duration.

    >i feel that you’re suggesting here some sort of phenomenon that’s permanently present (or at least persisting). however, i don’t think this is supported by either what you’re saying here, **or the buddha’s words.**

    You often use the phrase "the Buddha's words", but have so far not provided any evidence that the Suttas discuss experience in the terms you advocate. They certainly do speak of arising and ceasing, but they also clearly speak of *duration* as I pointed out in my reply to VitakkaVicara on this same thread. See also what I wrote, with Suttas to support it, regarding *paṭiccasamuppāda* not being a "momentary process", an idea which on the other hand is not found in the EBTs.

    >“Sir, suppose they were to ask me: ‘What are the things for which arising is evident, vanishing is evident, and change-while-persisting is evident?’ I’d answer like this:

    >‘Reverend, the arising of form is evident, its vanishing is evident, and **change-while-persisting** is evident. The arising of feeling … perception … choices … consciousness is evident, its vanishing is evident, and change-while-persisting is evident. These are the things for which arising is evident, vanishing is evident, and **change-while-persisting** is evident.’

    —SN 22.37

    >we can directly see this - we can see that consciousness of various objects comes and goes, and this demonstrates impermanence to us directly. nothing stays in the stream of dependent origination permanently - anicca - and this process is infinitesimally quick. I don't think we can deny this.

    We certainly can deny it. The "infinitesimally quick" change is an imaginary construct seen by a person who already decided beforehand, when told by somebody else, to look at experience that way. It is not immediately apparent, timeless, and verifiable (independent of scientific and technological advances that didn't exist in the Buddha's time) as the Dhamma is said to be. What *is* undeniable even to an illiterate farmer is that things are *subject to change* and never last infinitely, and that's quite a different matter.

    >when we, delusionally, take conditioned phenomena to be permanent, satisfactory, and possessed of some reliable essential nature, we suffer.

    Yes, and something does not need to be in "flux" in order to be unreliable. That's an unjustifiable jump.

    >the mind craves permanence - delusion pushes us towards it - and seeing how denial of that permanence causes suffering is instrumental in us seeing through samsara.

    This very statement implies that at least craving *does* last for more than a single instant. It implies that there was craving before the change happened, and since that craving was *still* there at the time of the change, suffering arose.

    >rather, i am saying that anicca is actually about the arising and passing away in the mind of mental / sensory objects that are cognised, sensed, perceived, and acted upon mentally. it's not about the external world but the internal one:

    Again, yes, the Suttas speak of "arising and ceasing", and I'm not discounting that. What I and the Suttas are disagreeing with is the "0 duration" idea.

    >seeing phenomena solely in terms of non-ownership misses this broader understanding that they actually have no essence.

    SN 22.95, and perhaps others, certainly alludes to the "lack of essence" in all the aggregates. But where does it say that the lack of essence is due to flux? Looking at the similes given by the Buddha there, does a lump of foam (a plantain trunk, a mirage) lack essence *because it's constantly changing*?

    >from my reading, it seems the buddha is saying the reverse of what you are suggesting - that is, it is because the aggregates are anatta, they cannot be compelled, not vice versa.

    This is grasping at straws.

    >the pali word that has been translated as 'remain' here is uppajjanti, meaning "presents oneself; is present, appears; stands". 'remain' seems a fairly loose [translation](https://suttacentral.net/define/upa%E1%B9%AD%E1%B9%ADhahati?lang=en).

    No, it's "upaṭṭhahanti", which occurs *besides* "uppajjanti", showing that it's clearly not the same. "upaṭṭhahati" literally means "stand near", and it always implies duration.

    >i don't think there's any real connotation of feelings persisting here, but rather "arise, present and pass away".

    So the Buddha repeated the same idea twice for no reason?

    >the relevant word here is 'thitassa' [meaning](https://suttacentral.net/define/%E1%B9%ADhita?lang=en) 'standing; being, staying (in any state or condition, often with absolutive); remaining, existing, present; firm, steady'. given the context of 'alteration' and change of the phenomena, i don't think the line supports a notion of a static persisting state.

    Alteration (aññathattaṃ) *of that which stands* (*ṭhitassa)* is what it literally means. The genitive (-assa) conveys "while". Again, the point is that change occurs *within* stability or duration. But ultimately, everything that remains stable in relation to something else *eventually* also changes, which is why nothing is ultimately permanent. The phenomenon of darkness stands unchanged while particular changes happen from dusk to dawn, but even that which was stable eventually *has to end*, and thus the sun rises. That is the structure of change that Ñāṇavīra proposes, and that is verifiable from basic observation, and dukkha and anattā follows seamlessly from it without having to introduce things like:

    >actually, if you think about it, walking requires constant feedback from proprioceptive and sensory receptors to keep balance as we raise a foot, and to adjust our weight as we walk on say uneven gravel.

    ...which are not timeless and directly visible (akālika, sandiṭṭhika) Dhamma. It hinges on notions facilitated by modern science (which, valid as they may be, are irrelevant to suffering and freedom from it). The Buddha also never thought of bringing it up, which is at odds with the degree of importance you attribute to it.

    >unless you're suggesting that the mind processes information in parallel (which isn't supported by dependent origination), 

    Again, you're taking it as an axiom that dependent origination is a "process", whereas I've already shown here that the Suttas do not support that interpretation, and blatantly acknowledge that things do last (not forever, but for *some* amount of time).

    The very Sutta you quoted in your post proves that the Buddha thought it perfectly appropriate to state that the body can stand (tiṭṭhati) for way longer than an instant. And the context makes it clear enough that he's not talking about "conventional truth" vs. "ultimate truth".

    >This body made up of the four primary elements is seen to last for a year, or for two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, or a hundred years, or even longer.

    You will always find a way to disregard the evidence if you cling strongly enough to a view, so I don't think there's anything more I can do here.

    >What do you make of Ven. Bodhesako's claim that the background only exists in relation to a particular point of view, that it ends when the perspective changes?

    It's correct. It always depends the point of view you take, the very thing which is being denied in vain (while it's still there) by the idea of "flux", as if all experience is happening from one static and unchanging point of view (ironically implying permanence of the point of view that looks on at the endless change). Every point of view that can be taken is itself determined by circumstances and thus subject to change.

    When you exist on the level of sense objects, the body/sense organs will seem "extra-temporal" from that perspective (which is not an explicit thought or idea but a tacit context), and you won't be able to see it as also *subject to* change at the level where it truly is, thereby undermining the perceived permanence of anything you might take as self, without un-absorbing your point of view from sense objects, which is the purpose of virtue and sense restraint.

    That's one of the ways to understand the simile of the wet sticks in [MN 36](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn36).

    >As I understand it, FS is essentially an analysis of Invariance under Transformation, so it has nothing to do with impermanence. It describes the structure of duration. 

    Yes, the purpose of FS is to "prove", regardless of the Buddha's teaching, that the idea of "flux" and "moments" is at best a view that gets "plastered" on top of experience, in denial of the way things actually manifest. For 99% of people it's probably pointless to study it, since those who already have faith in his teachings and try to take on the phenomenological attitude fail to understand it, let alone the people who staunchly believe in flux, who do so precisely due to not being able to think phenomenologically and coherently.

    >So is the *aniccatā* that the Buddha speaks of pertaining to the relationship between the foreground and background of experience,

    Yes. Or you could say it's about the relationship between your experience and that which determines it, due to which it's liable to abrupt cessation (which is also within that experience, but needs to be *known* as a context, not directly attended to, such as the body).

    >I'm trying to figure out where I should be focusing my practice.

    That would be the Gradual Training. Even if all these things "make sense", they would not be seen concretely, in the manner that would liberate you, unless the prerequisites have been established.

### Facing boredom and not chase after pleasure

One of the biggest bound with sensuality I have to work on is my attitude when facing boredom. For as long as I can remember I've always tried to escape boredom with pleasurable and stimulating activities to the point where I developped an irrationnal fear of it.

For so long, I've even followed a process that will dictate what I will do most of my free time that can be summarized thus:

**If thinking about doing such and such activity**

* Doesn't provides me with pleasure at the prospect of doing it, I'm feeling an aversion for doing that activity as if it's going to be a chore and I will not do that to kill time
* However if it does provides me with pleasure at the prospect of doing it, I will probably dabble into that until it does not provides me with pleasure anymore (sooner or later in a matter of days/weeks)

Most of the time I will always need to have something to do on the side when I'm not busy, if I don't I will be restless, an unreasonable feeling of dread will take hold of me "I don't know what I'm going to do later, I need to find something quick", relentlessly reviewing past activities and new possible forms of activity until I find one that can provide me with pleasure.

*(Note that I don't have any difficulty regarding doing things that need to be done but which doesn't provide me with pleasure at the prospect of doing them, I'm only talking about the free time when duties and essentials basic tasks have been done)*

I think I've clearly adopted an attitude of aversion towards boredom and irrationnal addiction towards pleasure, and the fact that it has so much weight in my life and that it basically leads it is the sign that I need to get rid of it.

**So,** I really need ideas to start changing these habits otherwise I will just continue to repeat this never ending cycle, so I came to wonder: what do noble disciples free from sensuality do when they have free time? I believe they are probably not chasing pleasurable and stimulating activities in the way I'm doing it.

Should I just force myself to sit or go for very recurrent walks and dwell in non-activity most of my free time? Working to establish yoniso-manasikara and lessen appropriation of the aggregates; applying what Ajahn Nyanamoli teaches regarding becoming aware of craving in my experience and including my attitude in regard to it as being there because of craving; just dwelling in an untroubled state without forcing anything when feeling pleasant or on the contrary take advantages of these moments to question and review in what ways I could still be liable to craving and work on severing the resistance...

Surely I also could do activities related to the Dhamma, like studying suttas and books about Dhamma, at least when the prospect of doing it feels like a chore or neutral enough, and is not provoking delight so I know that is not going to be unwholesome activity disguised as wholesome.

    You don't have to come up with a specific "plan" in order to not give in to the pressure of boredom (since that would become your giving in to it). All you have to do is make sure that *whatever* you do is still in accordance with the context of allowing the pressure to endure for as long as it wants, and that might very well vary from one day to the next. Only you can know when a particular action—externally wholesome as it may be, including contemplating the Dhamma—is or is not aimed at escape thing boredom (based on the inclinations of your mind *right now*, not some pre-defined guideline).

### Questions on suffering and views.

warm greetings all,  


**Q: Suffering arises as a result of our views on experience (the 6 senses)?**

Examples of what I mean by this: 

1. The view that these thoughts/feelings are mine. 
2. The assumption that I have to act on this idea from the mind.

If this is true, then by just being attentive/aware of what happens throughout the day \[with withdrawal from sensory engagement\], you can see what sort of habits/assumptions about the 6 senses you have. Then you can modify those assumptions (by no longer acting in that way). Is this correct? For example, I could have had the view that "this thought is horrible" and have aversion towards it. But then I change my view around it to "let me (openly) hear what this thought has to say", which removes the aversion around it.

  


What I don't understand is what makes wrong views like "externalism" or "materialism" so wrong. Those to me seem like philosophy (doesn't really affect my direct experience) vs what I described above is about reality (looking at your present experience). Why does it matter if someone thinks that "everything is molecules" if that same person corrects the way they regard experience in terms of their views on the 6 senses?   


&#x200B;

    >Suffering arises as a result of our views on experience (the 6 senses)?

    Yes, but the caveat is that those views that are the root of suffering are not deliberate. Starting from the point of view of ignorance, which we all do, it's utterly impossible to take a detached perspective from which you can see your own views and assumptions. The views and assumptions that cause suffering are there precisely because you are unable to see yourself having them. Otherwise, the Buddha's teaching—whose essence is in telling you that there *are* wrong assumptions no matter how sure you are that there aren't for as long as you're not at least a sotāpanna—would not be necessary.

    Therefore:

    >If this is true, then by just being attentive/aware of what happens throughout the day \[with withdrawal from sensory engagement\], you can see what sort of habits/assumptions about the 6 senses you have. Then you can modify those assumptions (by no longer acting in that way). Is this correct? 

    No, you would be practicing attentiveness/awareness *with* the wrong assumptions from start to finish, and anything that you're able to "catch" and then modify would be superficial and secondary.

    The wrong assumptions can only start to become apparent for what they really are over a prolonged period of time, as a result of gradually facing the discomfort that arises from no longer feeding the dependence on sensuality and emotional safety that one finds in the world. Only a stream-enterer or higher has understood the nature of assumption and freed themselves from it partially (but irreversibly). The understanding of the Four Noble Truths, which is what makes one a stream-enterer, is all about the recognition that *no amount* of unpleasant feeling—irrespective of its cause or characteristics, so not limited only to painful bodily sensations but including the deepest and most complex types of emotional upset and dissatisfaction—is in itself suffering\*,\* and it is rather craving alone that is responsible for suffering.

    And one also starts out not even seeing that craving for what it is, noticing at best its secondary byproducts like obvious lustful or angry thoughts, which can be very well be individually managed and suppressed for quick relief without putting a dent on the actual craving.

    >What I don't understand is what makes wrong views like "externalism" or "materialism" so wrong. Those to me seem like philosophy (doesn't really affect my direct experience) vs what I described above is about reality (looking at your present experience).

    Such standpoints of "philosophical" nature are also secondary results of the actual views and craving that are not even seen. That's why a person can perfectly align their standpoints with "Buddhist doctrine", rejecting both eternalism and materialism and embracing (what they think is) the Middle Way, and yet their underlying view would remain unchanged, shown by how they remain equally subject to suffering.

    >Why does it matter if someone thinks that "everything is molecules" if that same person corrects the way they regard experience in terms of their views on the 6 senses?

    It matters because if they had truly understood their six senses, they would realize that whether "everything is molecules" or not is totally besides the point, and thus they would simply stop thinking in those terms. They would realize that their idea of "everything is molecules" (or the opposite, that nothing is molecules) is and always will be fully enclosed within their six senses, and thus it cannot possibly be a statement about a supposed external reality "beyond" the 6 senses (which can only be conceived through a wrong assumption, never actually experienced).

    Thus, if they still adhere to that view or any other of that nature, it can only be because they remain ignorant of the nature of the six senses.

    >Then based on either the experience of (#2 and/or #3) someone then changes their views? Or if there is something wrong with my understanding may you please explain a bit more?

    It's not even that they would necessarily change their views. But at least they would begin to recognize the real "scope" of the problem if they go through with the restraint, and would stop thinking that changing their views is as easy as they may have previously thought.

    >What would you consider to be a prolonged period of time

    Indefinitely. If there is an intention to "return" at some point, it doesn't actually count as withdrawal, and the mind would not reveal its true colors.

    >to what extent does one need to absolutely withdraw from unnecessary sensory engagement?

    Completely. But the caveat is that it's not about "sensory deprivation" and total isolation from everything in a contrived retreat environment, which is unsustainable and would have to get interrupted at some point. The practice is to continue living your life "normally", except for the fact that you *never*, *without exception,* act upon a mental state if it's bound with sensual craving, aversion, or desire for distraction. The foundation for that is the 8 precepts and the guidelines on speech (no harsh, slanderous, or trivial talk), and then based on that the subtler tendencies and views on a mental level can start to become revealed at their "root", and then restrained and abandoned.

    >Is craving something other than any pull/push on top of the present experience? Is it different from the pressure (felt either physically or mentally) to act on X \[eat cake, pursue an idea, etc\]?

    It depends. It is a "pull" for sure, but unless you have been living withdrawn, the "pull" you would be seeing would really be a secondary after-effect of the craving, not the craving itself. Craving is non-specific, and much more subtle than the obvious hankering after some particular thing. In fact, both indulging in your desire *and* trying to get rid of it and manage it fundamentally keep adding to the same craving.

    Restraining particular desires *might* eventually reveal what craving is. But it's not guaranteed, especially if one isn't making enough effort to understand.

    >Isn't there a sort of a counter-intention, in that someone who still values sensuality, but wants to no longer value sensuality, has to have a intention/goal of "I will not consider or act out of this current value of sensuality" \[which is visible as a push/pull\]?

    Yes, what will be motivating you will of course still be a form of pull. But that's why it's a Gradual Training. Even if you end up acting out of agitation or pressure of some sort in order to keep the precepts unbroken, that's OK, because at that stage the level of acting out of pressure that you're concerned with is that of bodily and verbal action. The subtler pressures won't even be clearly recognized at that point, so there's no need to worry about them.

    Therefore:

    >In my direct experience the real problem I see is with the mind in that it tells me to do this or that, even if I don't want to do this or that. Do you see it differently?

    Yes, that's true, but the point where you would begin to have a mind that doesn't pressure you in any unpleasant ways is in the first jhāna. And you won't reach that point unless you get your virtue and sense restraint in order first. Once those have been well established and stable for a good while, you can start trying to discern how to not be driven by *any* kind of pressure, even the "wholesome" ones, which is the stage of purifying the mind from the five hindrances.

    >Bhante do you see anything wrong with my understanding? Is the way I use dukha and craving the same way you understand them?

    It's fine as a contemplation to motivate you to restrain yourself. The profound recognition of what craving and dukkha are would only become available later on as a result of having restrained yourself long and well enough.

    I would just add, in light of the above, that it's not about holding *no values*, since that's a value that you're inevitably holding as well. It's about not valuing sensual pleasures specifically, and valuing renunciation instead, even if out of craving initially. Eventually you can learn to value renunciation and be equally restrained but without craving, and that's when you would be at peace.

### Role of focus

Just looking for perspectives on this particular view of practice. As I understand, the only problem with contemporary practices is the notion of avoiding what is present in favor of fully indulging in one sense object.  However, if you can maintain awareness of the necessary overlying context, ie; body is the container, and you don't shift away from anything that arises, then there is no problem with stabilizing the mind on the sensation of breath, for instance.  It's actually better than letting it jump all over the place and cause trouble. 

Either way, the phenomena don't care about you, they will arise.  But in the 1st option, your underlying view is that they ARE yours since you don't have enough insight persisting.  With peripheral awareness, you have just made a simple discernment, and now that knowledge is included in this otherwise very similar experience.  You don't lose that knowledge unless you deliberately go and distract yourself from it.  But just sitting on the breath won't make established background knowledge fade away, and it also won't prevent other things from arising.  So the difference emerges in that arising, where the meditator with peripheral awareness feels no need to turn away from pain, towards pleasure, etc.  Or if they do, they know where that pressure comes from too. It takes YOU out of the sense objects, essentially.  But that doesnt mean that YOU shouldn't stabilize your mind... it's more peaceful, more wholesome than letting a monkey jump around and steal food from passers-by.  Even if you know it's not your monkey, everyone would be better off if that thing were tied down and given something of its own to nibble on. 

I ask this because I have seen videos where Ajahn seems to discourage this type of focusing, and on the other hand I've directly heard "yes, by all means focus on the breath if it keeps you from acting out of the hinderances"  in another video.  I just want to clarify this so I can put it to rest in my own practice, I'm sure that there is a subtle piece that I'm not appreciating that kind of unites both sides of the coin, or maybe I correctly identified that piece above.  Either way, I'm unsure. 

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1c3khnr/role_of_focus/kzimzir/)** _2024-04-14 11:10:42:

    > the only problem with contemporary practices is the notion of avoiding what is present in favor of fully indulging in one sense object. 

    No, that's not the only problem with contemporary practices. Although it's less common, there are many teachers who *speak against* the intense concentration on one fixed object (a paradigm originating from the now mostly disregarded Visuddhimagga) and advocate a more "open awareness" style of practice instead, and that doesn't make their approaches right by any means.

    >then there is no problem with stabilizing the mind on the sensation of breath, for instance.

    Well, there is no problem with that *in itself* inasmuch as there is no problem with staring at a wall, sweeping leaves, or sewing. The problem is when there is a *view* that doing that in any way contributes to the cessation of craving any more than staring at a wall, etc. does (because those things also keep your mind from "jumping all over the place and causing trouble").

    While you're watching your breath (or anything else of that nature) and everything is seemingly clean and pure, passion, aversion, and distraction, and all the ignorance and wrong views are very much still there lurking, pulling the strings "from above". To use an analogy, all it really does is make the defilements operate at a lower frequency that the "ear" of an ordinary person no longer detects, and so it *seems* to them like they have a pure and unagitated mind at that time. To someone who's been sleeping on urine and excrement their whole life, even the dustiest of floors will seem clean.

    So instead of that, a person should make effort to see for themselves what exactly are the defilements, what is that "jumping around" of the mind really, instead of rashly assuming that it's as straightforward as the content of thoughts changing from one thing to the next—in which case a sniper whose mind does not waver from his intended target would have a mind that's not "causing trouble" at that time. Any sensible person knows that that's not the case, but they would not reflect deeper and realize that their meditation should revolve around stopping *that* kind of trouble on every level instead of just slowing the mind down, which is, as illustrated by the example, utterly unrelated to the problem. It's the basic error of mixing up correlation with causation: "whenever there's a lot of craving, my mind moves around a lot, and therefore the movement is the culprit".

    And getting to understand what craving actually is—which can only be done on the basis of steadfast virtue and restraint—will require lots of "movement" of the mind in the form of self-questioning, investigation, and reflection, and that is not a problem at all, because even the first jhāna *is* thinking-and-pondering, as the Suttas themselves say (although nowadays people like to insist that the Buddha used the term *vitakkavicāra* when he really meant something else).

    >I ask this because I have seen videos where Ajahn seems to discourage this type of focusing, and on the other hand I've directly heard "yes, by all means focus on the breath if it keeps you from acting out of the hinderances" in another video.

    You're probably referring to [this instance](https://youtu.be/-039SYi2a94?si=l2DSdYd7wN1sOejK&t=685). He said right afterward that the difference between attending to your breath rightly is and wrongly is whether you have the view that the *arising of the thought itself* is an issue, and you definitely would have that view if you are anchoring your mind in the *sensations* of your breathing, which is not Anapanasati at all. Having your attention on the level of sense objects, whether it's one fixed object or a range of constantly changing ones, inherently prevents you from having the type of perspective that can even recognize what the hindrances are, let alone overcome them. Again, at best it makes them operate at a lower frequency.

    [This talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwRqWW79kFg) goes into detail on abandoning the hindrances, and it's in those same terms that Anapanasati should be understood.

### Money, Material Safety and Dhamma

Do you think making money and following Dhamma are incompatible?

I know of the tenth precept as well as of Ajahn Chah emphasizing the fact that you can't want to follow the Dhamma and stay attached to your money (I'm paraphrasing).

I am asking because something like 1 year ago ago I started wanting to make money so as to be able to escape my current life and condition, but I quickly realized it wasn't going to happen or at least not very quickly, and it started making me quite miserable feeling so much delight at the idea of having much money so as to have that material safety and not have to restrict my wants and just escape the "rat race", but not being able to experience the target of that delight.

During this time I started investing my dormant savings here and there, and a few months later, because of that miserable feeling and the fact that I was questioning more and more the point of continuing that quite absurd meaningless life of commute, work and sleep, and also not being interested in the usual point of interests people are looking for in life so as to keep going (family, friends, career, the holy...), I was coming back to Buddhism stronger than ever because I was curious about the Buddha and his way of being able to be at peace without all these material considerations, and also because I felt a natural inclination towards the Buddhist spirituality for a long time.

Thanks to the Bhantes at Hillside Hermitage I feel like I learned a lot in the past few months about the Buddha teachings and also about "myself" and I was even surprised by how I was able to have more self control and to reduce my suffering in my daily life.

Until there I was letting my investments work without giving it much consideration, but recently my interest for it started rising again since it began to give me good results and also needed me to give it more attention so as to optimize the profits. But with it came back the lure of profit as well as the agitation, worry and the doubt, I realized I've been thinking almost exclusively about that in the previous weeks, the delight in the prospect of material safety came back even though I know it is quite pointless and will not be source of happiness/peace at the end of the day; and that my Dhamma practice have practically come to an halt, that I have even regressed on some points.

And so this led me to question whether these two aspects of my life could coexist, giving it all to search material safety on one hand (which has such a strong pull) and giving it all to search spiritual safety on the other hand, right now I feel like they are in complete contradiction and going toward one leads me further away from the other.

Not sure why I'm bringing this, I think I already know the answer to that question, maybe just to try and find some motivation and samvega, but I guess I would like to know how YOU are dealing with that, and also just address the topic on this sub and hear what you think about it

**Edit:**

**Materiel safety** is a bit too encompassing, I was mostly thinking about **monetary freedom**, being able to answer all monetary needs, for yourself and for your close ones, that kind of relative safety, also not needing to do alienating jobs wasting the time we have at our disposal but being free to live however you want and need (in the limits of the law)

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1c2a3r6/money_material_safety_and_dhamma/kzce3lw/)** _2024-04-13 05:04:46:

    It seems like you're presenting it as an all-or-nothing when it shouldn't be. You can invest effort in taking care of your finances without it necessarily involving giving in to hindrances, but what *is* black-and-white is that, at least if you hope for significant achievements in the practice, satisfying your sensual desires and worldly ambitions must not be in the list of intended uses for the money you earn.

    If you set that up as a context and make effort in constantly recollecting it, the amount of concern and agitation that would arise would be severely limited, since fundamentally the cause of any hindrance is dependence on sense pleasure (i.e., the *why* of your attempt to earn money, not the attempt itself).

### Would that meditation practice be ok ?

After encountering HH I dropped my morning sitting practice to focus on sense restraint first. Since then sense restraint helped me tremendously to improve my outer and inner conduct. I can clearly experience the pressure on the senses when the mind is craving something. I can clearly see how it is indeed disagreeable when the mind doesn't get what it wants. At times I noticed too how this craving appears and just vanishes without having done anything to suppress it. As explained in this sub before, the restraining needed to be tighten at some point because things got easier and I was't feeling bothered anymore. This has been my experience. I'm nowhere perfect as I'm still struggling noticeably in the evening time to not indulge in watching TV shows or to browse the web.

So my question is  : Would it be ok now to start practicing again a sitting meditation in the morning knowing that this won't bring any kind of insights but it's just pleasant and healthy for the brain ? It might also helps in stopping the pattern of the mind which seeks instant gratification. My fear is that I don't want it to be a cheatcode making me  unable to feel the pressure/craving on the senses. I actually tried this morning. Inspired by a video from HH (the ultimate method for overcoming hindrances) it went like this : I brought up in the mind a thought of sensuality to see how the mind reacted and immediately desire arose. I did not indulge furthermore the thought but concluded this desire was not leading to detachment and I'm not free from sensuality. Did the same with the other hindrances. The problem is that at some point contemplating like this the mind got quieter and when I brought up those thoughts the mind was more or less unmoved and some pleasure arose. Because it felt useless and wrong at this point to bring up thought of hindrances I switched to knowing the breath. Just knowing that I was breathing in or out. If I got distracted I tried to identify if it was a thought of ill-will, agitation and so forth without totally forgetting the breath.

So is that totally wrong or is that ok to practice sitting mediation along those lines ?

    >The problem is that at some point contemplating like this the mind got quieter and when I brought up those thoughts the mind was more or less unmoved and some pleasure arose.

    If you are asking this question (i.e., there was the possibility for doubt in your experience at that time), then it must have been because you didn't actually address the hindrances sufficiently. You have "addressed" the hindrances when there is no chance for even the greatest of your desires and the greatest of your fears to move you even as you're thinking about them. And you would never achieve that just by observing your breath in the way you're describing, which is more like getting occupied with something else altogether instead of [doing the work](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=XfnlunP24iI). 

    Instead of finding one nice, clean corner in a messy house that you can dwell peacefully in when you close your eyes and forget about the rest (which is what most meditation practices are about), it's about cleaning the whole house—*trying* to find dirt—so that eventually, no matter whether you walk, stand, sit, or lie down *anywhere* in that space, you will be at ease. Only the latter qualifies as right samādhi, and fosters the type of wisdom that matters.

### "One has to experience the pleasure of jhana before doing the sense restraint"

I've encountered this view i.e. that one has to achieve jhana before one can start abandoning sensuality since it will alleviate the pain of restraint, quite a handful of times on Reddit, SuttaCentral and even heard it from some ajhans. Does this view have any grounding in the suttas? Because, prima facie, it seems that such view contradicts many suttas (e.g. DN2) where a trainee get himself established in sila and restraint first, and only then he achieves jhana.

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1bz09ok/one_has_to_experience_the_pleasure_of_jhana/kyrmfcc/)** _2024-04-09 13:36:04:

    The view might stem from a gross misreading of [MN 14](https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/MN/MN14.html#mn14note03):

    >Sensuality gives little gratification and much suffering and distress, and the woe in it is what's greater. Mahānāma, even though a noble disciple has seen this as it is with right understanding, as long as they do not achieve the joy and ease that are apart from sensuality and detrimental phenomena, or something even more peaceful than that, they still might return to sensuality. \* But when they do achieve that joy and ease, or something more peaceful than that, then they do not return to sensuality. \*

    "Not returning to sensuality" means becoming an anāgāmi, the point being that unless a noble disciple (sotāpanna or sakādāgami) has become established in jhāna, they still be *liable* to thoughts and intentions of sensuality. But it does not imply at all that even a noble disciple, let alone a puthujjana, is justified in not being restrained until the jhāna is magically bestowed upon them. [No restraint means no jhāna; right restraint *is* jhāna](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.97/en/sujato?lang=en).

    As stated in AN 10.61, it is the misconduct of body, speech, and mind caused by lack of sense restraint that lies at the root of the five hindrances, so any practice of “jhāna” that somehow circumvents the need for sense restraint, putting the emphasis on various other things instead—having nothing to do with inclining the mind towards renunciation, [which is how jhāna comes about](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an9.41#an9.41:7.1-an9.41:7.18)—is sure to be misguided.

    >“Bhikkhus, having not given up these six things, it’s impossible to abide having entered upon the first jhāna. What six? Sensual desire, aversion, indolence and lethargy, restlessness and anxiety, and doubt. And the woe in sensuality hasn’t been seen clearly as it is with right understanding. \* “Not having given up these six things, it’s impossible to abide having entered upon the first jhāna.

    —[AN 6.73](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an6.73#an6.73:1.1-an6.73:1.5)

    It goes without saying that whoever does not practice sense restraint has not fulfilled the sixth prerequisite.

### Is experiencing less suffering the yardstick to judge the efficiency of a buddhist method ?

If I'm not mistaken it's when we experience less suffering thanks to implementing the Buddha's teaching that we can accept it without a doubt. If such is a case, how can we dismiss other buddhist teachings or even non buddhist teachings as dead-ends even though according to numerous autobiographies and testimonies those others methods (Dzogchen/Mahamudra/Advaita) produce an extinction of suffering ? For reference, [this gem of an answer from Bhikkhu Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1agagmv/possible_explanation_on_how_meditation_methods/) answers partly this question but doesn't address the suffering aspect which is why I'm posting this.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1bu9apb/is_experiencing_less_suffering_the_yardstick_to/kxv2ase/)** _2024-04-03 15:05:56:

    No, "experiencing less suffering" is practically speaking not an accurate measure, because that can be achieved through various other means, including other religions, which from a Buddhist point of view are based upon wrong view.

    The way to tell that a teaching works is that it pushes you to first and foremost acknowledge your liability to suffering *more* instead of less, and frees you from the whole "size" of that liability even while it's there, rather than the opposite way most teachings go of encouraging you to *ignore* the fact that you're liable to suffering, uncertainty and disappointment by getting absorbed on something that you have greater control over, and then helping you cover up the issue even more by layering various poetic concepts and mystical notions over it.

    For example, a person would be free from attachment towards things they depend on and not suffer if something happens to them because "in ultimate reality" there are no "things" for them anymore, but just a heap of [*kalapas*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalapa_(atomism)) \*(\*or whatever other fancy metaphysical idea their individual approach rests upon), whereas the Buddha's teaching would force you to acknowledge the significance of the things you hold dear and free you from all delight and attachment as well as lamentation and despair *while their significance remains.* It's like you're no longer frightened by a scary figure because you put a mask over it, instead of *actually* having become fearless.

    >There are some ascetics and brahmins who perceive that it’s day when in fact it’s night, or perceive that it’s night when in fact it’s day. \* This way of being of theirs is muddled, I say. I perceive that it’s night when in fact it is night, and perceive that it’s day when in fact it is day. And if there’s anyone of whom it may be rightly said that a being not liable to muddledness has arisen in the world for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans, it’s of me that this should be said.

    —[MN 4](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn4)

    As a corollary to this, the right practice of Dhamma will for most people (especially today) be more unsettling than reassuring in the early stages, because it requires uncovering a wound (the liability to suffering) that has been festering for ages but had been kept at bay with a combination of bandages and morphine.

### Right View vs. Fruit of Stream Entry

Would it be correct to state that Right View as an understanding of 'what needs to be done' comes about as a precursor and pre-requisite to the 'experience' of Stream Entry ?

In other words, Right View constitutes the knowledge of the path and practice that can lead to a temporary 'event' where one experiences freedom from the hindrances. Is this an accurate statement to make ?

If this is accurate, would Right View be a precursor to an *inevitable* Stream Entry fruition ?

    >Would it be correct to state that Right View as an understanding of 'what needs to be done' comes about as a precursor and pre-requisite to the 'experience' of Stream Entry ?

    Yes, a person on the path to stream entry could be said  to possess the Right View. With that I mean the [first of the 8 noble individuals](https://suttacentral.net/sn25.1/en/sujato?lang=en) who is already[ guaranteed to become an Arahant eventually](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn34#mn34:10.1-mn34:10.2), and not just any devoted "Buddhist practitioner" (see comment at the second link). 

    >In other words, Right View constitutes the knowledge of the path and practice that can lead to a temporary 'event' where one experiences freedom from the hindrances. Is this an accurate statement to make ?

    Not quite. There is no "event where you *experience* freedom from the hindrances", in the sense that it *"*comes over you" one evening by itself. The hindrances are abandoned [through *diligence*](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=sn35.246)*,* (with uncompromising virtue and sense restraint as necessary prerequisites) so it's whenever that person who is already a noble one is steadfast enough in doing that work that they will acquire the "fruit" of stream entry, of which the release and joy are secondary and not to be emphasized at all. What actually matters is that they gained unshakable certainty in their *understanding*, and thereby given up the first three fetters. They would've unavoidably solidified their understanding at the time of death anyway, as stated in SN 25.1, but that's the worst case scenario.

### Guarding the sense doors

Hi, I've been quite interested in this practice for the past few months, and I find that I've been in contemplation/meditation for a while, I can experience what this means. I've also experienced glimpses of the deathless before, so I get it on that "level" as well. However, with my normal waking mind, this is quite difficult. I try but the practice seems to have little no potency. 

&#x200B;

I would like to be able to practice throughout the day, during my "normal" life and I'd like to practice it more effectively when I am deciding to train. Do you have suggestions for both situations? I read in another post about sights being the easiest to start with, does it make sense to start there? I made a list of signs and features you might perceive with the eye: 

&#x200B;

 

* Labels
* Names
* Beautiful.Ugly 
* Tall/short
* Meaning
* Color
* Thin/fat
* Far/near
* Shape
* Color
* Texture, smooth, jagged etc. 
* Memories they provoke
* Ideas and beliefs they provoke
* The emotions and feelings they provoke

&#x200B;

Does this seem useful, am I missing anything? Any thoughts/feedback would be helpful. 

&#x200B;

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1bte1mb/guarding_the_sense_doors/kxq2dia/)** _2024-04-02 17:07:31:

    Sense restraint is not about preventing any of the things you listed from arising, which is unsustainable and ultimately impossible. It's about the recognition that *what* you perceive is not up to you to decide, but that you are certainly responsible for whether you choose to allow your mind to get sucked into those perceptions in such a way that desire or aversion increase.

    >Having seen a sight with the eye, he doesn’t grasp at signs and features of it on account of which—due to abiding with the eye faculty unrestrained—bad, detrimental phenomena of longing and upset would flow in on him. He practices to restrain that; he guards the eye faculty and brings about the restraint of the eye faculty. 

    Most people hold the view that their defilements are the fault of the objects and thoughts that arise for them, and from that the natural course of action is to try to shut everything out. But the defilements are in your *attitude* towards the objects, and if that is not clearly seen, you cannot possibly know what the signs that either nurture or diminish that attitude are. And precisely because people see the practice as involving suppression of everything, it creates this artificial distinction between "normal life" and "practice time", since you clearly can't be living with that intense focusing on every twitch of your attention all the time. But the defilements, when discerned clearly, can and should be restrained 24/7 even while you go about your life (as long as it doesn't involve breaking the precepts, see below), and you would never get tired or wound up from that unbroken practice. On the contrary,[ it's where the true peace comes from.](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.94/en/bodhi?lang=en)

    Also, sense restraint is always the stage that comes after virtue and seeing the danger in the slightest fault in the [Gradual Training](https://suttacentral.net/mn107/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=sidebyside&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin), so it's impossible to do it properly unless one is already proficient in never transgressing the 8 precepts. Sense restraint will not help you make keeping the precepts easier; it's the other way around: purifying your bodily and verbal actions from desire and aversion *first* will eventually allow you to discern how, on the subtler mental level that sense restraint operates within, those same defilements arise.

    >So ... would the same principle be true for sense restraint? One restrains the impulses of anger and desire they feel, but on the level of thinking out of them instead? And are these impulses what is meant by "nimittas" in sense restraint?

    Not quite.[ Impulses arise because of a lack of sense restraint beforehand.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFYC49o_rHQ) The purpose of sense restraint is, as the formula always says, to prevent states of desire and aversion (impulses) from "flowing in".

    Sense restraint simply means preventing yourself from becoming absorbed in the "world" of an arisen object, to put it like that—preventing loss of perspective, because that is always the root of desire and aversion.

    >I have seen Ajahn Nyanamoli describing sense restraint as restraint concerning the SIGNIFICANCES of sense objects... but surely things can be significant but still NOT evoking of lust/ hatred, no?

    "Significance" in this sense doesn't mean "relevance", but more like "characteristic". But characteristic not in the sense of patterns, shapes, auditory frequencies and so on on the ultra-particular level of sensory perception as people would think (operating on that level entails being already unrestrained in the way that actually matters), but on a more general level that involves all the five aggregates (that's what a "phenomenon" is).

    For instance, when you encounter agreeable food, there will be a whole array of feelings, memories, ideas, pressures, intentions, etc. associated with that food (and that includes even the inclination to get super focused on your eating to "catch" the moments of delight similar to what you described), and sense restraint is practiced by not falling for *any* of those more particular directions including in the name of "practice", while also not preventing it from being there completely. You just don't "open the door" for it (i.e. *grasp at* the arisen signs and features).

    You would practically achieve that by staying with the general context that you're eating the food only for the sake of survival even *while* the other myriad of more detailed significances are trying to catch your attention, and not allowing yourself to overthink it (but also not "underthink" it, i.e. losing the right context which will result in falling into delight in the food).

    [This recent video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igC9gzKZV6o) on the HH channel describes precisely how sense restraint works: you don't put things in the "center stage" of your attention, but at the same time you don't try to completely shoo them away as is people's natural reaction (because that requires you to grasp at their signs and features, ironically; the sign of "deny this" still involves "this").

    Sense restraint prevents you from *losing* perspective in the first place, but when you have already lost it (i.e., when you find yourself already getting ragdolled by the impulses and obsessions), then the task is to [regain perspective](http://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn20) (and obviously  to foresee it next time).

    >What I'm referring to is when overall, I'm feeling neutral, or even pleasant - and yet, there are more specific pressuring feelings of displeasure or pleasure within that simultaneously - what I meant by "impulses". It's that initially manifested experience that I can't really prevent - a pressuring displeasure WITHIN the neutral feeling that COULD potentially take over if I give in to it. It doesn't seem to constitute a "loss of perspective" yet at that point.

    >...perhaps our disagreement here may stem from different ways of using the word "impulse."

    I see, I indeed misunderstood what you meant with "impulse". In that case, yes, that's exactly what sense restraint is. The analogy of the bee buzzing in front of you is quite accurate. It's because people, if they don't outright indulge, have a tacit expectation that no "buzzing" should take place *at all* right from the start that they can't practice sense restraint and all the rest properly. But[ it's not a matter of choice](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=an9.42#an9.42:3.1-an9.42:3.9), and enduring the "buzz" [is necessary](https://suttacentral.net/an5.113/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=main&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin) once your virtue is firmly established.

    >As such, the overall experience of when I HAD to eat certain foods that I desired would simply be awkward and somewhat uncomfortable, with the tension just sitting there, waiting for involvement.

    That's why it's said that pleasure [should be seen as pain](https://suttacentral.net/sn36.5/en/bodhi?lang=en&reference=main&highlight=false), and that requires the "buzz" to be there to some degree (mentally, of course).

### Sankhara as an attitude?

I was reading the translation Ven. Anigha released for MN 35 and found this interesting [note](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn35#mn35:4.5-mn35:4.6) here which states:

> saṅkhāras are, strictly speaking, neither the simplistic “choices”, nor the abstruse “fabrications/volitional formations”. They are “movements” in the most general sense, but they need not always be fully deliberate. For instance, a puthujjana's misconceiving of the aggregates as “mine” is a saṅkhāra (SN 22.81), but because they're unable to recognize that attitude as a saṅkhāra—and thereby straight away as impermanent, in which case they would irreversibly cease to be a puthujjana—that “activity” continues to take place. It is therefore not possible to simply choose not to take things as self: that saṅkhāra is neither a “choice” nor an “intention”.

SN 22.81 states the following:

> Here, bhikkhus, the uninstructed worldling, who is not a seer of the noble ones and is unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma, who is not a seer of superior persons and is unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma, regards form as self. That regarding, bhikkhus, is a formation.

I'm unable to understand this, maybe I can sum up the difficulties in comprehending this into different parts:

1. Why is that "regarding" an activity?
2. It makes sense for that "regarding" to be an attitude: I simply *find* myself already having appropriat*ed* this experience as a whole *for me*. But this understanding of that "regarding" as an attitude seems incompatible with that "regarding" being an activity. One is implicit (attitude), whilst the other is explicit (activity).

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1bq9hju/sankhara_as_an_attitude/kx3q24x/)** _2024-03-29 12:59:20:

    >1. Why is that "regarding" an activity?

    >2. It makes sense for that "regarding" to be an attitude: I simply *find* myself already having appropriat*ed* this experience as a whole *for me*. But this understanding of that "regarding" as an attitude seems incompatible with that "regarding" being an activity. One is implicit (attitude), whilst the other is explicit (activity).

    \* Because it's something that can be brought to an end, something that's “taking place” rather than something that's static (in which case one would be hopelessly subjected to it and thus to suffering). Of course, a puthujjana cannot stop regarding things as self simply by trying, but that's because they haven't recognized the "regarding" as it is to begin with. Thus, whatever they might think needs to be stopped will not be *that* activity, but rather some other one that's secondary to it. If they did recognize it, they would give it up immediately as the Sutta says, but then they wouldn't be a puthujjana anymore.

    In other words, the root of the puthujjana's problem is not that he regards things as self, but that he can't even recognize *how* he's regarding things as self—it's an ignorance of ignorance (\*\*§\*\*25 of [Ñāṇavīra's Note on PS](https://nanavira.org/notes-on-dhamma/paticcasamuppada)). That's why your efforts should always be directed at rectifying your views about what the sense of self and ignorance even are, rather than at relinquishing whatever you may currently think those things are.

    \* The attitude will feel implicit to the extent that it's not understood. But the more the "dust" that is obscuring it is cleared out ([through none other than virtue and sense restraint](https://suttacentral.net/an10.61/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=sidebyside&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin)), the attitude gradually begins to become more explicit. Once there is not a trace of doubt about what the attitude is, the attitude will be gone, and that's stream-entry. Then, for a stream-enterer or higher, taking things as "mine" (the subtler *asmimāna* as opposed to the coarse *sakkāyadiṭṭhi* of the puthujjana) *is* in a sense a matter of explicit choice, which is why they're instructed not to do so in MN 1 and throughout the discourses.
- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1bq9hju/sankhara_as_an_attitude/kxd39j3/)** _2024-03-31 06:00:25 *(in reply to a comment not included)*:

    >With the ignoring of that arisen notion, there is conceiving of what is perceived (perceived is not recognized as 'just' perceived). Conceiving what is perceived there is the notion of seperation (self and the world are different), unity (self and the world are the same), seperation-and-unity, neither-seperation-nor-unity. 

    Yes, but it's important to clarify also that "just perceived" doesn't mean what people usually think it does: feelings should not exist, only "raw sense data". They may not outright say the point is to get rid of feelings but that's really what it is if you read between the lines. Apply this contrived view to everything you experience so that with the suppression of feeling, there is suppression of craving, while ignorance remains unaffected.

    So quite contrary to that, you would learn to "just perceive" things by not overlooking what is being felt--- non-specific pleasantness, unpleasantness, or neither---while there is perception, as opposed to by attending even harder to "bare perceptions" (which covers up the immediate symptoms of the illness of dukkha by actually making the root cause, ignorance, worse).

    >The "assumed privileged position" (the regarding) is also *ignored* and will remain ignored to the extent that the All hasn't been discerned. With the non-ignoring of the All, there would be the non-ignoring of the "assumed privileged position" to the aggregates on account of which the privileged position implying mastery ceases as the mastery is seen 'within' non-mastery. 

    Correct. The "assumed privileged position" is there because, while there is perceiving, most importantly the current feeling and the intentions in regard to it (the other half chunk of "the All") are not sufficiently recognized as simultaneously present (ayoniso manasikāra). That's what not grasping [the signs of the mind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMl8C1ViL1c) means. There is then automatically the assumption (which is not at all conscious or deliberate) of that other half of the All (background) happening somehow "outside" of the rest (the foreground), hence "privileged position". With ignorance, there will be assumption; you don't need to *decide* to start having *upādāna*, as people would think, and thus it's also not a matter of choice to stop it: the direct choice to stop it will be happening from that same "privileged position", that same ignorance, thus maintaining it.

    >The hindrances hinder is because they maintain the non-recognition of the All because they keep one 'stuck' to immediacy and prevent the recognition of the *presence* of the reflexive hierarchy. And this is why sensual desire is the *chief* hindrance: it is *the* basis for occupation with immediacy (= six senses). Being occupied with immediacy, one maintains one's ignoring, and maintains the ignoring of one's ignoring.

    Yes, it's impossible to act out of a hindrance without at the same time overlooking the presence of the background (peripheral feeling and intentions in regard to the thing you're acting out of). 

    >If this isn't too unnecessarily technical of a question, could you elaborate on how the reflexive hierarchy is the citta? I wonder whether there's something I'm misunderstanding regarding the citta on account of which I'm unable to understand the relation. The reflexive hierarchy is in essence degrees of knowledge of what is present, but what does this hierarchical knowledge have to do with the citta which holds the *attitudes*?

    It's nothing mystical or esoteric. The citta is really just the reflexive (background) aspect of the experience as a whole. As implied in what I wrote above, when you're having an experience in the foreground (which will always be composed of all the five aggregates, never just one), there will be another background "half" to that (which will also be composed of the five aggregates). yoniso manasikāra is about taking any aspect of the general level (body, feeling, moods, phenomena) and not losing sight of it while the particular (again, involving the whole five aggregates) endures. When done rightly, that right then and there closes the opening for every type of unwholesome, and sustaining that is what "tames" the citta: the hierarchy "broadens" so that there is no longer have a tendency to lose sight of the general, even if you make no effort to remember it, and that's samādhi.[Whether you walk, stand, sit, or lie down, there can be no hindrances](https://suttacentral.net/iti111/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=sidebyside&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin) (see also AN 3.63).

    Being rightly aware of that background is all it takes, you don't need to then get rid of the pressure to act out. You just maintain the recognition that there are these two simultaneous aspects: the thing (1st "half" of the All), and the intention to act out of it (2nd half), and just keep that dog ["on the the leash"](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.247/en/bodhi) for as long as it takes. 

    That's the entire principle of purification of the mind, without exception. And, of course, when you act out of body and speech, there is 0 possibility of discerning any of this, as you're already swimming far past the origin of the stream, so to speak. That's why virtue comes first.

### Why is fear not explicity called out as a hindrance ?

I have been wondering this for sometime now, and as far as I can tell it is likely because fear is embedded within the first two hindrances of sense-desire, and ill-will. 

The way I see it, fear is the manifestation of the pain of the likely unfulfilment of sense-desire, or cessation of object of sense-desire. 

In this regard, fear is also the underlying proximate cause for ill-will in.

However, the phenomenon of fear is such a primal one - and the Buddha also spoke about it specifically in Suttas (Fear & Terror).

I am curious regarding the treatment of fear as a hindrance, and the nature of practice that strikes at the root of it.

My understanding is that *freedom* from fear, is synonymous with having attained the deathless - since the likelihood of fear persists as long as death applies (i.e. the phenomena of person-hood still remains). Hence one is free from the fear of death (and consequently *any* fear), only at the attainment of the final knowledge. 

Kindly correct my understanding if inaccurate.

    Fear could be considered as being within the fourth hindrance, which is agitation/anxiety in general. It's also the 9th of the 10 fetters, abandoned only by an Arahant.

### Just sit and die?

Hypothetically speaking, if you really got yourself rid of desire (you won't leave your meditation to chase some sort of sensual pleasure, like "let me go and grab a snack" or "let me watch a movie"), and you get yourself rid of aversion (any pain or discomfort from sitting won't disturb you, not even if you sit for hours), and you have contentment/equanimity (you're completely content while meditating, you don't need anything else, you're OK), wouldn't you just "sit there" and die then?

    No, what you're describing as freedom from desire and aversion is becoming a robot (unfortunately confused with Arahantship quite often). 

    An Arahant still [experiences motivation to do things](https://suttacentral.net/an8.82/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin), as that is part of the five aggregates, [even in samādhi](https://suttacentral.net/mn111/en/sujato?lang=en). 

    But the difference with an ordinary person is that such actions are never rooted in a sense of entitlement to feel one thing and not feel something else (see [this reply](https://reddit.com/comments/1bni9q7/comment/kwlzdi6) for more on what that means). So if the action he was motivated to do does not produce the expected results, he will not suffer at all, having fully understood that his own experience does not belong to him. And that difference in the way they see things would not even be necessarily apparent to someone else from the outside, apart from the fact that there are [a few specific things](https://suttacentral.net/an9.8/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin) an Arahant can never do (and which someone who hopes to move closer to Arahantship should certainly not be doing either).

### Not acting out of any feeling

I was reading the article by Sister Medhini about fixed views vs unfixed certainties (https://www.hillsidehermitage.org/fixed-views-vs-unfixed-certainties) and towards the end she says "if you train towards not acting out of feeling to any extent at all...." 
This seems amazing to me. Is this how we should train?

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1bni9q7/not_acting_out_of_any_feeling/kwlzdi6/)** _2024-03-26 07:18:18:

    There is a difference between acting "with" a feeling and acting "out of" a feeling. The latter means that your action is rooted in either desire to increase a pleasant feeling or resistance to an unpleasant feeling. But if you make an action without either of those attitudes regarding the feeling that is there, you didn't act "out" of it.

    For this to make sense, it must be understood that "feeling" is always a broad mental phenomenon, and it's, to put it roughly, what you're referring you when replying to the question "how are you doing right now?".  A feeling is emphatically not a physical sensation.

    When you're hungry, there would normally be both an unpleasant feeling (i.e., a mental uneasiness), and a physical sensation in your stomach. An action of eating would be "acting out" of the present feeling if you eat in order to get rid of the mental displeasure, as opposed to just the physical phenomenon of hunger. In other words, if your motivation behind eating is emotional. You would know that it is because there's some particular food that you want, for instance, as opposed to just about anything that will quell the physiological hunger.

    With any feeling, there is an endless range of things that you can do which would not be a form of acting "out of it". If your mind is obsessed by the pleasant feeling of some sensual object, you can do chores, go for a walk, read, think about other things—pretty much anything that does not entail engaging with that object by body, speech, or mind. So "never acting out of feelings" does not entail locking yourself up in a dark cave and never moving a limb ever again.

    >However, this seems to state that there is only *a* feeling. But, isn’t there feeling associated with each sense base?

    There is, but there is one feeling in your experience as a whole that determines how the particular feelings in each sense are experienced, and it is that broader feeling that one shouldn't act out of. On that broader level, there can only be [one feeling at any given time](https://suttacentral.net/mn74/en/sujato).

    >This was how I understood how I could have a pleasant experience of eating something nice whilst being in pain physically. 

    Both of those instances would be particular feelings. If the more general feeling were unpleasant, (e.g., you know this is your last meal) then even the nicest food would not feel satisfying. If the more general feeling were pleasant, even physical pain would not bother you (e.g., when people are so pleased by the context of "I'll look better in the mirror" that the pain of exercise can even be enjoyable).

    You "act out" when your choices are aimed at increasing pleasure or avoiding displeasure on that general level, not when the action is directed at a particular feeling (e.g., [the Buddha interrupting his discourse to lie down because his back hurts](https://suttacentral.net/mn53/en/sujato).

    But, again, feelings are not sensations, so what the Buddha is trying to get rid of there by lying down is not just the sensation of tightness (a perception) in his back, but also the mental displeasure (feeling) that is associated with it. And it's not unwholesome because the more general feeling, whatever it was in that situation, is still being endured and not interfered with. 

    And that's also you wouldn't necessarily be able to tell an Arahant externally: you would still see them doing things so as to change what they feel on the particular level (except breaking the basic precepts and celibacy). The deeper layer of feeling that they have thoroughly understood as "not mine" and are incapable of resisting or delighting in is apparent only to them (and to each individual respectively). The idea that you train equanimity by arbitrarily enduring particular pains (such as not moving even when your knees hurt during meditation, or the whole bunch of Jain practices) is thus entirely misguided. Ascetic practices, if undertaken, must be done with reference to the general feeling; otherwise, they're no better than any plain old military training.

    Edit: You can think of perception as encompassing things like (for each of the 6 senses respectively): blue, yellow, red; high pitch, low pitch; petrichor, lavender (smells); salty, sweet, etc.; hard, soft, cold, hot, etc., and finally the endless array of content of mental images. Feeling, on the other hand, is only "nice", "not nice", or neither.

    >Let's say I'm feeling neutral and then out of the blue I'm starting to feel lustful. If vedana/feeling can only be pleasant/unpleasant and neutral, being lustful here would be what ? and would it be a particular or a broad vedana ? Maybe I'm making this complicated when it's not ... sorry if that's the case.

    Lust is not a feeling. It's your attitude towards the general feeling that seeks to make it more pleasant (or less unpleasant) by seeking out particular pleasant feelings. And you *can* certainly succeed in producing the particular pleasant feelings you wanted—that's not the problem with lust.  Fundamentally the suffering was on the level of the general feeling, which can very well remain the same despite experiencing even the best imaginable pleasures on the particular level. Therefore, by giving in to lust, one makes oneself more addicted and dependent on what is essentially a risky gamble (whether you actually succeed in altering the general feeling through the particular ones).

    >Also does this understanding of having two kinds of vedana (the broad one and the particular one) is based only on the satipatthana (vedana within vedana...) or is it a natural understanding coming from disparate suttas showing both broad and particular vedana being taught by the Buddha ?

    It's implied in many Suttas, especially wherever dispassion/Nibbāna is described as pleasant (*sukha).* For example, SN 22.43 describes how by knowing the nature of a feeling (which could in itself be *dukkha*) as it is, one would abide at ease (i.e., a general pleasant feeling). That would not be possible if both feelings were on the same level: it would require you to replace the old feeling with a new one, and for that the aggregates would have to [be in your control](https://suttacentral.net/sn22.59/en/bodhi?lang=en). Not seeing that there are two layers of feeling at any given time automatically results in attempts at "management", and from the previous paragraph it should be clear why that amounts to meditating with sensuality.

    (The same principle is also echoed in AN 6.55 on the section about the Arahant's citta (i.e., his general feeling) remaining unmoved regarding the feelings of the 6 senses).

### Only an anagami removes hindrance of doubt?!

In [another post](https://www.reddit.com/user/Additional_Fix8417/), Additional\_Fix8417 has said that:

>Edit: regarding vicikiccha, it is only doubt in the Buddha’s Teaching that is uprooted by the sotapanna. The sekha up until anagami still faces the hindrance of doubt (doubt as a general phenomenon, as it is tied to mama)

Without doubt as a fetter, how can it ever be a hindrance? It is like saying "*without roots, that plant will still grow and bother me*". The sotapanna removes all doubt regarding Buddha's Teaching  (*though he, and even an Arahant can still be ignorant/doubtful about unrelated worldly things disconnected from the Dhamma. An Arahant needs to ask for directions and ask people's names*).

Please explain.

Thank you.

    A sotāpanna is beyond doubt regarding the Triple Gem and regarding their own understanding, but they are still subject to resisting displeasure on a subtler level. The five hindrances are simply five alternative ways in which that tendency can manifest; they're not fundamentally different from each other, so you can't have three or four of them instead of five. If one of them is there, all the others are there by implication. So without fully having transcended the hindrance of sensuality for example, which a sotāpanna hasn't, the hindrance of doubt cannot but be there too.

    The fetter of doubt is not on the same level as this—it's not doubt about this or that. It's specifically about how the puthujjana lacks certainty about what the way out of suffering is. So, in other words, if a sotāpanna is not diligent enough in recollecting the same understanding that already freed them from the fetter of doubt and that they cannot doubt, the hindrance of doubt will be lingering; if he does make effort, the hindrance will necessarily fade. But the puthujjana is still in the woods about his understanding to begin with, so that he may not even be able to give up the hindrance of doubt no matter how hard he tries. That is due to the fetter of doubt.

    >Hindrance of doubt is manifestation of fetter of doubt. How can sotapanna be hindered by doubt in the Buddha, Dhamma etc?

    It's not doubt about the Dhamma, as I pointed out. It's the natural, inherent uncertainty in everything else that is there even for an Arahant,  and which carries an unpleasantness that the sotāpanna might fail to fully withstand, and thus they end up acting to get rid of that unpleasantness at least mentally (= hindrance of doubt). Hence I mentioned that it's on the same level as sensuality. If you have desire for something, the uncertainty that it might get taken away by somebody else or that you won't get it will emotionally affect you (= hindrance of doubt), etc.

### How Virtue, not “Concentration” or “Absorption”, Overcomes the Hindrances

    >Bhante, this comment isn't directly related to the content of this post but I didn't think it was significant enough to warrant a separate post. However, I was currently looking through [this entry](https://notesonthedhamma.blogspot.com/2024/03/ma-198-ariya-savaka-noble-disciple.html) on the meaning of ariyasavaka that argued it meant "disciple of the noble ones" instead of "noble disciples". From searching the suttas on instances of ariyasavaka, it appears to be a sound conclusion. Would it be possible to know your opinion on it?

    The article fails to provide convincing evidence. The first quote it gives does not mean one qualifies as ariyasāvaka by ordaining. It's rather operating on the premise that the person who ordained was already a noble disciple, i.e., got the Right View, which is how they'd be able to follow all of the instructions that come afterwards, especially the part about the four *satipaṭṭhānas* which is at the core of the discourse. As said in MN 107, even the Gradual Training is for trainees (*sekha*)*,* namely the first 7 of the eight noble individuals. It's not at all far-fetched that in the Buddha's time, most people would  ordain *because* they got the Right View, not in order to get it. Apart from the greater proliferation of sensuality in people's mind's today, the other great issue is that when people gain faith in "the Dhamma" nowadays to the point where they would ordain, the vast majority of the time there are alien components in their view that don't fit with what the Buddha was actually teaching, whereas back then there was no room for such misrepresentations to prevail.

    The same principle carries over to the second passage quoted in the article from the Chinese Āgama:

    >"A householder's son hears that Dharma taught by him. On hearing it, the householder's son ***gains confidence in the Dharma taught by the Tathāgata***\*\*.\*\*"

    As per all the Suttas in SN 25 (Okkanasaṃyutta) one who "merely" has faith in the Dhamma is already on the path to stream-entry, i.e. they are the first type of noble individual (sotāpatti-magga). What this means is that unless a person is at the point where they're guaranteed to become a sotāpanna before they die, what they have faith in is ***not*** the Dhamma—it's on some level a distortion of it, no matter how much effort and dedication they put into practicing exactly what (they think) the Buddha said. That is what it means to be a *puthujjana*, and that's why the standard formula always says "...an unlearned ordinary person who has not seen the noble ones...", i.e., whatever they think would make someone a noble one is incorrect.

    Moreover, in SN 55.40 the Buddha clearly states that whoever lacks the four factors of stream entry completely does not qualify as an ariyasāvaka, but as "an outsider, standing on the plane of ordinary people". The qualification "totally and utterly" is there not to include the a puthujjana who considers themselves Buddhist, but to include the dhamma-follower and faith-follower, the sotāpatti-magga individuals referred to above (who are said to have "transcended the plane of puthujjanas" in SN 25) That is, they do have a degree of faith in the Triple Gem, and they possess the five faculties (which a puthujjana does not, SN 48.12). But they have not yet abandoned the first three fetters fully. And that is what explains the passage from AN 3.94 and others which you referenced.

    As for the last passage quoted in the article, an "untamed" death for a noble disciple would mean, for instance, a sotāpanna dying without becoming an Arahant. The whole Sutta is instructing a noble disciple on how to tame his mind, whereas a *puthujjana* doesn't see his own mind in the first place. In other words, a puthujjana wouldn't just die an "untamed death"; they would also die without even knowing what "taming" entails.

    So no, I'm afraid there is no flexibility. In order to qualify as a "disciple of the noble ones", if we were to translate it that way hypotethically, one would need to now *what* truly makes someone a noble one in the first place. Even if from a "third-person/public-world" perspective (which is impossible to actually have) that teaching *is* really the teaching of the noble ones, it would not be the teaching of the noble ones ***for you*** unless you know exactly what makes it so, i.e., are a noble one yourself.

    In the end, even the Triple Gem exists only "within you". Not in some corny way, but in the sense that it's always going to be what ***you*** think the Buddha, Dhamma, and Saṅgha are that you're putting your faith in.

### Trying to grasp how to not act out on a mental level (inspired by the recent video)

When my mind encounters a pleasant idea, for example a sexual fantasy, I understand that if I were to pursue it or, in other words, start to entertain it or delight in it, I would be acting unskillfully i.e. I would be acting out of pressure by trying to develop this thought further. When this understanding (that pursuing this idea is unskillful) happens some sort of a "click" occurs, for the lack of a better word, which "blocks" my engagement with such thought, and, afterwards, this thought retreats into the background of my awareness (so it is not in my immediate focus anymore, but I can still feel the pressure of it, so to speak)  while I continue whatever I was doing at that moment. I'm not trying to actively dispel such thoughts like some people might do with their intrusive thoughts.

So, is this the correct way of restraint on the mental level? Thanks

(Sorry for somewhat clumsy description, just want to understand how to practice).

    >So, is this the correct way of restraint on the mental level? Thanks

    Yes, in theory. But if it's not already resulting in the first jhāna by itself, it means that there's still some form of inaccuracy present (either still welcoming the thoughts somewhat or still denying them somewhat), and this would be  maintained by lack of restraint on the physical and verbal level. If that isn't impeccable, then it might *seem* like one is discerning the mental level correctly while actually one isn't. Discerning mental unwholesome actions correctly and restraining them would have to result in the impossibility of unwholesome bodily and verbal actions, not in simply repressing them or forgetting about the possibility to do them.

    As long as it's not being done to replace/override the other images, then yes, that is how the right thoughts are cultivated. That is subtler than it sounds; everyone starts with a natural tendency to try to sort out the unwholesome thoughts by just pasting the wholesome ones on top of them (e.g., the popular "loving-kindness" meditation), and for as long as that is the case, the whole effort will be rooted in aversion and will not lead to right samādhi. 

    That's why reflection requires "endurance". You direct the mind to wholesome thoughts _while_ the other images are still lurking around pressuring you to think them intentionally, and you refrain just from that final deliberate engagement (which is where all unwholesome states are to be found, not before that). 

    It's as if someone is asking you to sign a contract, but you simply don't do it, no matter how long they stand there trying to coerce you with threats. The purpose of the wholesome thoughts is to keep reminding yourself why _you_ shouldn't sign, not to keep telling the person to go away (which doesn't work because [he's actually your boss](https://www.hillsidehermitage.org/living-under-an-authority/)).

### In DN 21 and AN 9.3 what is the cutting of thought and reflexion referring to ?

Engaged in a conversation on another forum these two suttas were mentioned where the stopping of thinking and pondering is presented as a worthwhile goal and a usecase for anapanasati. It got me wondering as I've never heard about it before. I think in DN 21 the Buddha may be talking about first and second jhana where in the second thinkong and pondering are absent hence more happiness but I can't be sure. No idea for AN 9.3. What do you think ?

[DN21](https://preview.redd.it/4h2anxgkebpc1.png?width=1812&format=png&auto=webp&s=e73b0633fcae7924060be01dcd27c6ddfe59250a)

    Firstly, it's easy to overlook what the Buddha states as coming before those four practices at the end:

    >...  
    (5) A bhikkhu with good, friends, companions, and associates is expected to be wise, to be endowed with the understanding related to arising and passing away that is *noble, penetrative, and leads to the complete exhaustion of suffering.* **\[= a bhikkhu is a sotāpanna at least\]**

    >But then, a bhikkhu *grounded on these five things* should develop four further things.

    —AN 9.3

    (It's also clear from the context that "good friend" (*kalyāṇamitta*) is someone who could elucidate on and thus help you to attain such understanding, and therefore they must possess it themselves. It doesn't simply mean anyone who also happens to be a Buddhist).

    *Ānāpānasati* leads to the "cutting off of thoughts (*vitakka*)" if practiced correctly because it's about precisely the opposite of what people would generally think it is. Establishing the context of the body breathing as a background makes particular thoughts (*vitakka*) lose their significance and therefore subside because they're being undermined through *yoniso manasikāra.* That means that while they arise, they're being known as standing upon the necessary foundation of this body (that breathes).

    This is another story altogether than the usual focusing on your *sensations* of breathing in order to suppress your thinking, which is ironically prioritizing and increasing *vitakka* (immediacy) and overriding *vicāra* (reflexion/context), while it should always be the other way around.

    >“When this composure has been developed and cultivated by you in this way, then you should develop this composure with thinking (vitakka) and pondering (vicāra); you should develop it without thinking but with pondering only; you should develop it without thinking and without pondering.

    —AN 8.63

    Focusing on sensations (*vitakka)* can successfully be accomplished by children in the span of one meditation session, while, as the Sutta clearly says, what's actually being described requires the Right View (as well as virtue, learning from other noble individuals, and diligent effort in abandoning unwholesome states).

    Regarding DN 21, the fact that the happiness that doesn't have thinking and without pondering is better than that which does is simply a statement that the second jhāna is better than the first, and that should be uncontroversial. But the Buddha also stated that one who tries to enter the second jhāna without being steady in the first (which is *characterized* by thinking and pondering) will fail to get either of them (AN 9.35), and this is exactly what people are usually attempting to do.

### Skilful boundary for contemplation practice

To what extent is is beneficial/unbenefical to bring to mind circumstances that would cause one to suffer, as a means of ascertaining one's liability to still suffer? 

Just as it would not be wise to subject oneself to circumstances provocative of sensuality, in order to verify or test one’s endurance of it - would it not also apply to bringing up ‘thoughts’ pertaining to circumstances that are provocative of fear/anger/anxiety etc.? 

However, one of the suggestions Ajahn makes in his talks are to ask yourself from time to time ‘am I still liable to suffer / what could cause me to suffer’. 

How is one to understand where the skilful boundary lies in such an evaluation; so as to not overstep into the territory of unbeneficial. 

Many thanks in advance

    >So how would an Ariyasavaka then approach that very prospect ? He would discern an arisen citta afflicted with fear/anxiety, on account of that prospect, and he discerns an arisen unpleasant feeling simultaneously. He ***having established the right order beforehand***, that feeling is felt unyoked, and he endures it to the extent it persists. Therefore his task is to maintain that state of heedfulness of the background, under the pressure that tries to pull him towards the foreground, while that prospect of thought is present in the foreground.

    Yes. The "foreground" is not this or that specific thought or image, but the whole experience of the thing that's pressuring you. A noble disciple then knows how to rightly establish a background to that foreground so that they remain "unyoked" from it.

    >Further, is the endurance of the unpleasantness of that prospect of thought, in itself sufficient to erode the craving in regard to the thought itself and its likely materialsation in real life ? Or does the 'harness need to be tightened' ever so slightly (i.e. move gradually from the prospect of the thought, to slowly allowing the thought itself to be fully brought up and persist) as one progresses in this direction ?

    The mind will naturally be able to "look" at it more directly as the craving is indirectly starved by sustaining the right context, but you can't measure that progression. All you can do is make sure that to whatever degree of the thought is currently enough to provoke the mind, you refuse to abandon the context, and that you don't bite more than you can chew. Also, it's important to remember that this whole practice applies, as said in the video, when the mind isn't currently taken by any obvious unwholesome states. When there is something in particular that's agitating the mind, the right thing to do is to not act out of it until the mind goes back to baseline. Trying to do the contemplation at that time would result in [acting out of aversion to the pressure.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ny71L92YnFk)

    >When he discerns that the prospect of that thought is no longer as provocative of aversion, how does he then confirm that it is truly an erosion of craving - and that he hasn't simply 'got used to it' - or are the two the same thing ?

    It would be clear that it's truly an erosion of craving because the mind is not shaken by the storm anymore, rather than there no longer being a storm (AN 6.55). In other words, the same feeling is still there, but the mind is now equanimous *in spite of it (* uprooting)*,* not equanimous because the old feeling got replaced with a neutral one (management).

    >“Herein, what are the six kinds of equanimity based on the household life? On seeing a form with the eye, equanimity arises in a foolish infatuated ordinary person, in an untaught ordinary person who has not conquered the boundary \[of pressure\] or conquered the results \[of action\] and who is blind to danger. Such equanimity as this does not transcend the form; that is why it is called equanimity based on the household life.

    >“On hearing a sound with the ear…On smelling an odour with the nose…On tasting a flavour with the tongue…On touching a tangible with the body…On cognizing a mind-object with the mind, equanimity arises in a foolish infatuated ordinary person, in an untaught ordinary person who has not conquered the boundary \[of pressure\] or conquered the results \[of action\] and who is blind to danger. Such equanimity as this does not transcend the mind-object; that is why it is called equanimity based on the household life. These are the six kinds of equanimity based on the household life.

    That is also what is meant with "separation" (viveka) in the first jhāna.

    Yes, this is a feature of the original translation files from SuttaCentral that I've modified. Sections that merely repeat something that was already said are sometimes either left out if they don't add anything new—such as the repetition of the original statement after a simile—or are abridged (e.g., when the monks recount an already narrated event to the Buddha).

### Anagami and Arahants are in constant Jhana?

I was contemplating the hindrances and noticed that if all that was required to get into jhana was the temporary abandonment of the hindrances then that would appear to contradict the suttas. Ironically, in my contemplation I was contemplating the hindrance of doubt, and this question is certainly present on the basis of that hindrance, so in a sense I'm just pushing back my progress in terms of discerning the escape from the hindrances.

But simultaneously, I discerned a sense of fear that I thought was gone for good; I thought I was no longer liable to a significant protection towards 'my' worldview, but it seems I was wrong. So instead of just enduring doubt, I decided it would be a better endeavor for me to further push myself in a position of fear and endure *that*.

Now that I've established my intention here, I'll get to the actual issue.

It's quite clear from the suttas that hindrances need to be temporarily abandoned to abide in the jhanas. The Buddha compares the five hindrances to a prison, and it's clear that to abide in the jhanas, one must *escape* the prison and not just be at the mercy of the prison guards and just not get tortured by them for some time. Hence, the argument of simply 'doing away' with sensual desire temporarily without having explicitly discerned its escape beforehand and *actually* having escaped doesn't seem to hold. However, if discerning the escape from the hindrances is sufficient for jhanas, then that means an anagami, who would've ended any sensual desire (and consequently, ended all hindrances, as far as I can see), would be abiding in jhana constantly. And the same with an arahant.

However, this doesn't seem to measure up well with the suttas:

>'Sir, this is not my only incredible and amazing quality; there is another. Whenever I want, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, **I enter and remain in the first absorption**, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, **I enter and remain in the second absorption**, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected. And with the fading away of rapture, **I enter and remain in the third absorption**, where I meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’ With the giving up of pleasure and pain, and the ending of former happiness and sadness, **I enter and remain in the fourth absorption**, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.'  
>  
>AN 7.53

Nanda's mother is an anagami who can abide in all four jhanas, however, the fact that she states "whenever I want, ..., I enter and remain in the first absorption" suggests that there's a state where she *isn't* in the first jhana. But that normal abiding of hers should already be an abiding devoid of the hindrances as she destroyed the fetter of sensuality. So it appears that jhanas are abandonment of the hindrances + something else, and I'm unsure of what that 'something else' is.

In [SN 4.23](https://suttacentral.net/sn4.23/en/bodhi?lang=en&reference=none&highlight=false), we see the Arahant Godhika who's unable to remain in the "liberation of mind", which I thought referred to jhanas, but that doesn't seem to be the case as it's not mentioned in Pali. But then what can it be apart from jhana since the mind is already liberated for an arahant? Or maybe he wasn't an Arahant considering liberation of mind refers to that, and attained it when the moment he killed himself?

But I also remember reading some sutta where the Buddha or some arahant had some sort of pain and then decided to dwell in jhana (not sure if it was first or higher ones though) but the sutta seems to have just disappeared..

**EDIT**: It appears, at least currently, that I've solved the conundrum I was in through shameless use of analysis (instead of trying to discern escape from the hindrances, presently, thereby entertaining heedlessness). I would appreciate thoughts on this if possible:

AN 1.53 states that one with a mind of metta is not devoid of jhana:

>“If, mendicants, a mendicant develops a mind of love even as long as a finger-snap, they’re called a mendicant who does not lack absorption, who follows the Teacher’s instructions, who responds to advice, and who does not eat the country’s alms in vain. How much more so those who make much of it!”

However, according to MN 55, the Buddha *constantly* abides with that mind of metta:

>“Yes, sir. Sir, I have heard that Brahmā abides in love. Now, I’ve seen the Buddha with my own eyes, and it is the Buddha who truly abides in love.”  
>  
>“Any greed, hate, or delusion that might give rise to ill will has been given up by the Realized One, cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and is unable to arise in the future. If that’s what you were referring to, I acknowledge it.”

Thus, through basic *modus ponens* here, one can argue that the Buddha -- in his *constant* abiding -- isn't devoid of jhana. The only way I can currently conceive of contesting this is if one argues either of the following:

1. That either one of the translations are wrong
2. That either one of the suttas are inauthentic
3. That when the Buddha says that one with a mind of metta isn't devoid of jhana he doesn't *really* mean jhana (or he means a variant of 'jhana' that isn't discussed of in any of the suttas)

I cannot adequately assess accuracy of any claims to (1) or (2) due to my lacking analytical capabilities. However, (3) can be axiomatically rejected on the basis that the Buddha -- being the foremost of the teachers out there -- wouldn't willingly entertain a contradiction (A is not-A) so as to lead astray many of his potential disciples.

The issue that one is now presented with is the task of reconciling this interpretation with the supposed implication that an anagami is capable of abiding in non-jhana as mentioned in AN 7.53. After reflecting on the language, one can notice that stating "whenever I want I can remain in the first, second, third, fourth jhana" doesn't imply that one's default abiding is a state that is *not* those four states.

For example, humans can rightly state "whenever I want, I can enter and remain on the ground, in the underground, or above the ground"; these would be the only possible states of existence in space for a human with reference to the earth, but that doesn't mean that in stating this I'm existing in an area apart from such spaces.

Anyways, I certainly need to stop my analysis here otherwise I'll go back into even more of my previous analysis-inclined mind, which would exist in contradiction to heedfulness.

    Arahants and Anāgāmis are most certainly not constantly in jhāna. If that were the case, the Suttas wouldn't exist, since[ speech ceases in the very first jhāna](https://suttacentral.net/sn36.11/en/bodhi?lang=en)

    SN 17.30 also states that an Arahant can lose their "pleasant abiding in the present experience " (*diṭṭhadhammasukhavihāra*), an epithet for the jhānas, if things that obstruct solitude take up too much of their time.

    >The Buddha compares the five hindrances to a prison, and it's clear that to abide in the jhanas, one must *escape* the prison and not just be at the mercy of the prison guards and just not get tortured by them for some time. Hence, the argument of simply 'doing away' with sensual desire temporarily without having explicitly discerned its escape beforehand and *actually* having escaped doesn't seem to hold.

    That is true, but at the same time it doesn't mean that this escape would be permanent. The freedom from hindrances is indeed absolute and immovable while it's there; it's not that you simply "forgot" about these things for a few hours because you were focused on your meditation object. In other words, that state is such that even if you tried to arouse hindrances, you would fail, in the same way that in the past you would have failed if you tried *not* to have them. That's because what either overcomes or is affected by the hindrances is the *citta,* not *mano* or the other five senses, and all volition and direct control can only happen through *mano*.

    But if you don't protect the things that brought the citta to that "invincible" state, i.e., virtue, restraint, and seclusion, it would eventually fade away. An Arahant would not lose the first two, but they would on a daily basis be losing the third, on account of practical necessities like going for alms round.

    >The only way in which that can be argued against is if I were to re-evaluate some axioms and perhaps see 'jhana' as an idiom rather than the absolute jhana. 

    Well, yes, usually jhāna is taken as this fixed "state" that you are either in or not. There are the jhāna factors and so on, but it's not a clear cut binary. For example, when laypeople would hear the Dhamma from the Buddha the first time and become sotāpannas, the Suttas say their minds would become pliable and calm through understanding the danger in sensuality that the Buddha pointed out. You could say that's a taste of the first jhāna (not that the "full" version has less thinking or something, but even greater abandonment of hindrances, i.e. inability to lose context and dispassion despite any degree of thinking).

    Jhāna literally means "contemplation, reflection" (that is accompanied by pliability of mind and joy arising from burdenlessness), and not "ecstatic, mystical state of altered consciousness", as I pointed out in [this essay.](https://www.hillsidehermitage.org/what-the-jhanas-actually-are/)

    These are different contexts. You can put it this way: *citta* starts out defiled owing to one's own past actions, but you cannot directly reverse that. What you do is, having restrained unwholesome acts by body and speech, you also restrain acts of sensuality and aversion by *mano* (*manosañcetana).* If you do that properly, with discernment and *yoniso manasikāra*, the *citta* is purified, and then what comes through *mano* no longer matters because it cannot induce defilements regardless of how much it used to. It then becomes clearer that that's also Māra's domain, whereas before it felt like *mano* is "me".

### Citta

I’m trying to identify the citta in full clarity so to correctly practice metta. I Need clarity about it help would be appreciated

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1b8wy66/citta/ktyqpjy/)** _2024-03-08 19:58:24:

    You won't be able to identify the citta by trying to identify it; it would just be an abstract idea even if it's correct.  You get to see the citta in the way that actually allows you to develop it only by restraining yourself from the actions which by default run with the inclinations of the citta, and by not delighting in company and [dwelling in solitude.](https://suttacentral.net/an6.68/en/sujato?lang=en) To the extent you keep acting out of greed, aversion, and delusion to any degree, you are precisely adding to the ignorance of what the citta is.

    Once you start to see more clearly what the mind is on account of that basic training that basically "pulls you back in" from the level of the world and objects, you would get to see that aversion is not something that "happens" to you by accident—which is the only thing that would justify having to manage it and get rid of it through various secondary methods and exercises. Aversion is there because you intentionally let your mind take pleasure in the idea of removing unpleasant feelings that came on their own. And if you now see that attitude and are thus able to abandon it, mettā would automatically be there, because in the ultimate sense the problem was never the person or what they did to you. They were just the scapegoat for the realm problem: fact that you wanted to get rid of the unpleasant feeling. Now that that's not there, there would be no reason for you to not have a friendly disposition towards them.

    But without the sufficient preliminary training in virtue and restraint mentioned above, that subtle internal choice to resist the unpleasant feeling, which is the unwholesome attitude of the citta, would've never become apparent. You would instead be still trying to deal with the people that are causing that unpleasant feeling, by repeating the mantra "may you be well" and whatnot, ironically perpetuating the wrong view that the problem is on the side of the person or situation instead of your mistaken relationship to your own aggregates/senses.

    >However, all of this is possible quite easily *while* one delights in company, which is supposed to be obscuring one's perspective with regards to the levels of generality present in one's experience. So does that mean these attitudes that are discerned aren't really the attitudes of the citta, and the citta holds more fundamental attitudes?

    >Also, Ajahn seems to be stating that it's impossible for an untrained mind to even discern the attitudes if one is not physically secluded, which makes me even further believe that I'm not 'seeing' the right thing.

    Yes, therein lies the answer. All of what you described is still theoretical; it's not the concrete type of knowledge that would actually free you.

    The extent to which you truly know your citta as it is, is the extent to which you cannot suffer, because it entails becoming aware of craving and of how you're actually responsible for it. From that position, you couldn't possibly keep "doing" it even if you tried. You would get to realize that it's entirely impossible for craving, let alone any of its further unwholesome byproducts, to *impose* themselves on you (which is how you become incapable of engaging in management, which always operates from the view that these things just *occur,* and you need to be "antidoting" them after-the-fact). It would have seemed like craving is something that just "comes up" without your say only because you did not see your citta for what it was, meaning you did not sufficiently see resistance against  feeling as an arisen [intention that you can either give in to or not.](https://www.hillsidehermitage.org/the-nature-of-ignorance/)

    In other words, just being able to see the citta makes suffering become entirely a matter of choice—a choice which you of course could never intentionally make.

    > The only way through which I'm capable of 'discerning' that is through inference; for example, discerning that there is restlessness or boredom manifest, which must *logically imply* the existence of a more fundamental attitude of resistance towards the experience as a whole

    Yes, you start with that "inference". You know that on account of things like restlessness, there must be something more fundamental that has been nourishing those states to the point where they are. But if just you try to get rid of the first thing that you become aware of, which is what people usually do by trying to suppress any and all bothersome mental activity, you won't even allow yourself an opportunity to discern the citta. It's like preoccupying yourself with the flies out of the knee-jerk reaction to get rid of them ASAP, instead of investing that effort in [looking for the source of the stench that's attracting them to begin with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edaHv35nVek).

    >if one hasn't discerned the attitude of resistance that underlies one's experience as a whole, then regardless of whether one discerns the fact that there is this experience-as-a-whole that is present in conjunction with this fragile body, that 'experience-as-a-whole' is precisely *not* what one takes it to be due to the fact that the experience-as-a-whole would *also* include that always-enduring peripheral attitude of resistance which is what one will *now* identify with as being me, mine, what I am, however subtle. Thereby, not really dwelling independent of the *entire* world. Is this understanding correct?

    Exactly. You don't have to *choose* to regard something as you or yours in order for the sense of self  or attachment towards the world (the aggregates/senses) to be there. All that's required is for the discernment of the totality of the experience to fall short of what that totality actually is, and craving and ownership will find a "space" *automatically*. That's what the Buddha meant with "knowing things as they are" (*yathābhūta*); he wasn't talking about some ultimate hidden reality but about knowing these peripheral phenomena that are already there, but just get overlooked. And that's actually much harder and subtler than all the esoteric perceptions of sense objects that people regard as "insight".

### Can you observe the mind?

I’ve seen somewhere on HH that it isn’t possible to do this. Assuming the mind is not its thoughts; I am observing my thoughts? Feelings? 

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1b52k3t/can_you_observe_the_mind/kt5qzoy/)** _2024-03-03 15:43:19:

    The mind (citta) cannot be recognized as an object or through direct perception, including the "mental eye" (mano). The mind is, practically speaking, the domain where attitudes are held regarding the things you experience, including your innermost thoughts and feelings. That is to say, the mind is not the experiencing of a pleasant feeling, for example, but the attitude of welcoming and delighting in it (or the opposite if the mind has been trained). Therefore we often say that the mind is "always peripheral" to what you're attending to.

    This "indirect" nature of the mind is the reason why the Buddha compared  the individual who recognizes their own mind with a [skilled cook who picks up on the preferences of his master](https://suttacentral.net/sn47.8/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin). The cook does not *hear* the king saying "I like this dish; I don't like that one" (i.e., one does not apprehend the mind as an object), but he instead is able to indirectly infer the king's preference based on what he does with x and y dish. In the same way, you know your mind as that which inclines towards or away from experiences and harbors greed, aversion and delusion towards them.

    The citta starts to become apparent bit by bit through the Gradual Training, because the mind is that which insists in acquiring pleasure and getting rid of displeasure even when you set boundaries on that through your direct intention. It starts to become evident that there is that unclear "something" in your experience that keeps trying to go left even though you're earnestly trying to go right, so to speak.

    >What is the relation between the citta and the training?

    >Is the training supposed to help tame the citta so at one point it never comes into conflict with one's will/direct intention? Or maybe, is the training supposed to help one remove an assumption in regard to the citta? Or "just" to remove that ingrained tendancy to crave and replace it with the tendancy to not crave? Or something else..?

    >I don't really know what to make of it in relation to the knowledge regarding the aggregates and the senses

    First of all, the goal is to see the citta. Until one sees that, any idea about "what" needs to be trained, or even about what assumption or craving are, will remain inaccurate. When, having recognized the citta, one tames it (samādhi), the recognition of what the aggregates and senses are will be there on its own, because those things are already there.

    >“For one who is composed no volition need be exerted: ‘Let me know and see things as they are.’ It is inevitable that one who is composed knows and sees things as they are.

    —AN 10.2

    It's not like you need to go looking for "things as they are" somewhere else; they're being *overlooked* because of the underlying tendency greed, aversion, and distraction, i.e. the tendency to lose perspective of the context in favor of the content.

    Unfortunately, it is safe assume that that won't happen unless you at least become a sotāpanna. The things that you think of as "the Dhamma" while still being a puthujjana, and your motivations for practicing them, are things that you will lose when you die.

    You will certainly reap mundane rewards proportional to the corresponding effort that you put into virtue, restraint, generosity, and non-greed and non-aversion, but that doesn't mean that the "practice" as such would get carried over. That would only be the case for a noble disciple.

### Formal Meditation

What is the right way to go about formal meditation? Choose a context and let the mind revolve around that context? How do you all practice? 


Edit: when I say formal meditation I mean set time aside to contemplate certain themes that the Buddha recommends to reflect on like death, impermanence, un-ownability of the aggregates, dangers of sensuality, etc 

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1b3syte/formal_meditation/ksv3v4t/)** _2024-03-01 15:37:54:

    As u/SDC pointed out, it's not a problem to set aside dedicated periods of reflection. What we advise against is "formal meditation" in the sense of taking up some sort of exercise, *whatever* that may be, with the purpose of having some sort of special insight or experience resulting from it, failing to see that the relevant insight is found at the level where your views and assumptions with which you try to overcome suffering are.

    Instead, you'd just be trying to address whatever you *now* think suffering is, by overcoming whatever you *now* think craving is, in order to reach whatever you *now* think freedom from it is, by means of whatever you *now* think the path is. Since those background assumptions remain essentially untouched, you would actually remain stagnant on the level that matters, irrespective of how many liberative experiences and novel releases you achieve sitting on that cushion.

    Then there's also the fact that most of the time it doesn't actually affect, or not sufficiently at least, people's lifestyle "off the cushion", while in reality the choices affected with craving that one makes through one's life are what's most prominently responsible for one's suffering, not the lack of proficiency in whatever exercise the chosen meditation revolves around.

    The right "formal meditation" would be therefore about continuously questioning, discarding, and finally upgrading one's views about what meditation even should be if it is to lead to the end of suffering, for example, and about contemplating what exactly is hindering one from reaching that.

    Once this work is finished, and sotāpatti has been reached, as it inevitably would be, formal meditation is about being in solitude and purifying the mind from hindrances and craving, having now acquired the direct knowledge of what those phenomena actually are.

    >Like contemplating the danger of sensuality or keeping in mind the nature of the body and the actuality of death.

    You can do that, but always within the overarching frame of trying to understand what is the right way to practice those contemplations so that they free you from suffering entirely, not with the aim of just doing them as if that in itself will lead to something of value.

    > in keeping the right context in mind when engaging with things to make sure unwholesome states are not engaged in and proliferated. 

    And yes, for the purpose of restraint as well, it is necessary to keep a context in mind that prevents you from going with the grain of things that pressure you. So it's beneficial to set time aside to understand and cultivate those contexts, and discern how it is that they can prevent you from falling into unwholesome states not just then and there, but throughout your whole day. That's not really what people would tend to understand as "formal meditation" though.

    That's right. First they should lead to the overcoming of unwholesome actions by body and speech, and only then can unwholesomeness within the mental domain start to be seen more clearly.

### Questions on the right view

I had a couple of questions on the right view and would be grateful for any clarifications on this:

1. How is one with the right view sure that their mind will never lose this understanding? Just like all the other things in the experience that are liable to change, what is the property of mind that makes this kind of understanding not change?
2. Is the above knowledge of lets say the "permanence" of right view always known to the one with right view?

Thank you.

    >How is one with the right view sure that their mind will never lose this understanding? Just like all the other things in the experience that are liable to change, what is the property of mind that makes this kind of understanding not change?

    They would know that they have understood even the experience of not knowing, such that even if they were to completely forget everything they know about the Dhamma, they would still not suffer. That is how you know that you have arrived at the understanding that uproots things, instead of managing them, because the salient quality of management is its dependence on things that you learned and became skilled at, and could therefore gradually forget and lose your proficiency in. Just like any ordinary ability. That dependence on memories, perceptions, and acquired information is what's in common to every meditation method, and even the "insights" that may come out of them, which is why that can never result in anything but transient and conditioned freedom.

    >Is the above knowledge of lets say the "permanence" of right view always known to the one with right view?

    It's the same principle as the following:

    >“But Master Ānanda, when a mendicant is perfected, would the knowledge and vision that their defilements are ended be constantly and continually present to them, while walking, standing, sleeping, and waking?”

    >“Well then, Sandaka, I shall give you a simile. For by means of a simile some sensible people understand the meaning of what is said. Suppose there was a person whose hands and feet had been amputated. Would they be aware that their hands and feet had been amputated constantly and continually, while walking, standing, sleeping, and waking? Or would they be aware of it only when they checked it?”

    >“They wouldn’t be aware of it constantly, only when they checked it.”

    >“In the same way, when a mendicant is perfected, the knowledge and vision that their defilements are ended is not constantly and continually present to them, while walking, standing, sleeping, and waking. Rather, they are aware of it only when they checked it.”

    —MN 76

### New Essay: Pervading the World with Friendliness

    >equating this passive harmlessness with active intentional goodwill is an error.

    >grey is not black certainly, but it is not white. 

    The "passive harmlessness" that you're describing is not mettā. It's simply a mind still liable to ill will that momentarily does not have it. If the mental state does not fit the description the Buddha gives, then the tendency to ill will has not been sufficiently subdued. That's absolutely not the same as saying that "active intentional goodwill" has not been sufficiently fabricated.

    >even in the suttas you have quoted, the buddha directs monks to actively develop goodwill after abandoning ill will. this points to the two mental states being non-equivalent.

    It points them to foster and nurture the mental state that they already achieved. In MN 40 for instance, it clearly says that the monk abides in the liberation of mind through mettā having properly abandoned the unwholesome states that obstructed it. It does not say that first they abandon the unwholesome states, then they "do" their mettā practice, and ***then*** they abide with a mind full of mettā towards the whole world. 

    And yes, that state then has to be further cultivated, nobody says that there is no effort involved; there is, just as one must further develop and steady the first jhāna after attaining it. The point is not that mettā does not require effort at all, but that you don't get it by directly generating some preconceived idea of mettā *while* you still have the susceptibility to ill will, because that mettā, no matter how agreeable it feels, will be necessarily tainted by craving and hindrances, and thus not be of any value.  This is what the quote from AN 8.63 is referring to.

    In the excerpt from MN 55, the Buddha states that he can be said to abide in mettā as Brahmā would because he has destroyed any passion, aversion, and delusion on account of which ill will could arise. He doesn't say "I abide in mettā because I indeed have the greatest good will for all beings, like a mother for her child" or something along those lines.

    >‘When I exert a \[physical, verbal, or mental\] fabrication against this cause of stress, then from the fabrication of exertion there is dispassion \[[dukkhanidānassa saṅkhāraṁ padahato saṅkhārappadhānā virāgo hoti](https://suttacentral.net/mn101/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=sidebyside&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin#mn101:23.5)\]. When I look on with equanimity at that cause of stress, then from the development of equanimity there is dispassion.’ 

    The operative expression there s "cause of suffering". There will be cases where striving is what goes against the grain of craving, and cases where equanimity is what goes against the grain of craving. But first a person needs to have discerned for themselves what that "cause of suffering" is, and (to make it relevant to the topic at hand) that displeasure is not the cause of suffering—that displeasure is not ill will.

    When you see for yourself the in reality large (yet initially invisible) gap between even the most intense mental displeasure on the one hand—such as that of your limbs being severed one by one—and aversion on the other hand, then anything you do within that will not be considered "active striving" if you compare it to someone who can only avoid the unwholesome state by managing and covering up the *displeasure* of it, by manually producing the opposite. There will be different levels to it, but it's only "active" when compared to the right equanimity. 

    In other words, for someone who is used to management, the right type of active striving will feel like "just" equanimity, and the right equanimity will be something that they can't even conceive of yet.

    That is why there is wrong effort in the eightfold wrong path, culminating in wrong liberation, and all of it is based on wrong view (i.e., as to what the cause of suffering is). It cannot be taken for granted that as long as you're trying to overcome the defilement *somehow*, you're   going in the right direction.

    No, there certainly would have to be effort involved in attaining stream entry, But the key is that any effort would have to take place within the context that at any given time there is a high probability of not only falling into wrong effort, but of not knowing wrong effort as wrong effort. Not forgetting that the mind has a deeply rooted tendency for management that could creep in at any time.  Having that context, which is basically the right-est type of sati one can have initially, changes things completely because it makes the efforts be relentlessly self-critical and self-adjusting as opposed to being taken at face value. It also makes the whole thing more unpleasant, as the weight of ignorance and the lack of any safe ground to stand on is being rightly acknowledged.

    There are things that a puthujjana does that take them closer to stream entry and things that don't, but they will only know that in hindsight when they get the Right View and thus the ability to clearly know right as right, or Dhamma as Dhamma. And one thing for sure is that whenever something seems to "work" in eliminating your suffering and yet having discovered that somehow didn't turn you into a sotapanna, it's not the right direction, but still the old management in a new form.

    >i don’t disagree that metta practice can be practiced after one has broken the fetters of ill will.

    The point is that there can be no mind of metta until the tendency for will has been actually abandoned so that no amount of displeasure can push your mind into aversion at least at that time--that you cannot use metta to "antidote" your ill will by covering up the displeasure as it's typically done. I'm not saying that you need to abandon the *fetter* of ill will in order to practice metta, which would be illogical.

    >this is the mettacetovimutti that the buddha teaches that is additional to the worldly practice of metta

    The practice of metta that existed before the Buddha's type is supramundane if we compare it to the practice of management that is called metta today. The people who were proficient in it (e.g., [the teacher Sunetta](https://suttacentral.net/an7.66/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin)) did not become anagami merely because the Dhamma was not available in their lifetime. The development of mind they achieved on account of that practice *would have been* more than sufficient to destroy most if not all the fetters if they had met the Buddha, whereas the "worldly metta" you're describing doesn't even result in sotapatti even though people who engage in it have ample familiarity with the Buddha's teaching. It also doesn't at least result in the destruction of sensuality as Sunetta's practice of metta did.

    That means that it's of no relevant benefit.

    >bhante, when you say "until the tendency for will has been actually abandoned" it certainly sounds like you're saying the fetter needs to be broken (given the fetters are tendencies). if this is what you are inferring, i don't believe this would be correct according to the suttas.

    >if on the other hand, you simply mean that when a person starts to practice metta, they must simply put aside all thoughts of ill will when they initially start to practice, and while they continues to practice, then i would agree with you. this does appear to be the correct interpretation according to the suttas.

    Neither of these are what I'm referring to. Abandoning the tendency to ill will so that metta can arise means abandoning the hindrance of ill will. The hindrance of ill will is not the ***thoughts*** of ill will that you say must be "simply put aside". For you that "putting aside" means simply suppressing them and ignoring that you're still liable to them so that you can start fabricating benevolence instead.

    But what I'm describing is that the mind must reach a state where even if strongly disagreeable feelings would arise, they would not be able to move your mind into having thoughts of ill will, *without* needing to resort to the fabricated sense of "greatest goodwill" to cushion and ameliorate the displeasure.

    Again, the quote from AN 8.63 that I already included in the essay:

    >“Well then, mendicant, you should train like this: ‘My mind will be steady and well settled internally. And bad, unskillful qualities that have arisen will not occupy my mind.’ That’s how you should train.

    >When your mind is steady and well settled internally, *and bad, unskillful qualities that have arisen don’t occupy your mind, then you should train like this*: ‘I will develop the mind’s release by friendliness. I’ll cultivate it, make it my vehicle and my basis, keep it up, consolidate it, and properly implement it.’ That’s how you should train.

    * AN 8.63

    That state is temporary and it's not the same as the destruction of the fetter of ill will (but cultivating that temporary liberation would certainly lead to it eventually). That temporary liberation is simply the actual abandonment, as opposed to the management and covering up of the hindrances.

    >certainly, the weak man initially cannot lift the heaviest weights. they cannot bring forth metta in aversive situations - it does takes practice to get to that stage.

    >however, how else will they build their muscles except by practice? if someone dedicates themselves to the practice, and makes every effort to bring forth metta in aversive situations, they are lifting weights both on and off the cushion. at some stage their practice will mature and they will get it - metta will become easy for them in any situation.

    Yes, it takes practice to increase your skill in management, but that's not what I'm referring to. The management method you are describing is not training you to lift heavier weights; it's all about making the weights lighter so that you can lift them. Making yourself like and have affection for the person you previously found unpleasant takes all the "weight" off, so you're not making your mind stronger at all, but quite the opposite.

### How to abandon deeply rooted views/goals

Dear friends,

From past practice, I have some bad habits (that get triggered automatically).

For example:

The suppressing thoughts/thinking. From past practice, I tried to "have a quiet mind with no disturbance" which ended up suppressing things, (and painfully too). However now I believe this has become an ingrained habit, that can happen automatically when the conditions are right. For example: 

1. Thought arrises
2. Mind (automatically) suppresses it
3. Pain from that suppression.

How do I remove this habit from my mind, and in general other bad (habitual/automatic) habits? 

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1b2odzt/how_to_abandon_deeply_rooted_viewsgoals/ksyv576/)** _2024-03-02 06:10:12:

    You don't need to remove the habit directly. You just have to recognize that now, while that habit its taking place, you have a choice to simply recognize the "mind that wants to suppress" as "mind that wants to suppress", and simply not act out of it. That's how you would actually remove the fuel that's feeding that mental state.

    If you try to suppress the intention to suppress, you are actually feeding exactly the same habit in the name of overcoming it.

    >If you’re sinking in the mud yourself, Cunda, it is quite impossible for you to pull out someone else (**your own mind**) who is sinking in the mud. But if you’re not sinking in the mud yourself, it is quite possible for you to pull out someone else who is sinking in the mud. If you’re not tamed, trained, and extinguished yourself, it is quite impossible for you to help tame, train, and extinguish someone else. But if you are tamed, trained, and extinguished yourself, it is quite possible for you to help tame, train, and extinguish someone else.

    >In the same way, someone who is cruel extinguishes it by not being cruel. An individual who kills extinguishes it by not killing. ... (an individual who suppresses extinguishes it by not suppressing).

### "Rightly discerning aggregates is like penetrating a hair-tip with an arrow".. why?

I was reading this Sutta and came across this verse:

>“Those who see the five aggregates   
>  
>*Sukhumaṁ te paṭivijjhanti,*   
>  
>as other, not as self,   
>  
>*vālaggaṁ usunā yathā;*   
>  
>penetrate a subtle thing,   
>  
>*Ye pañcakkhandhe passanti,*   
>  
>like a hair-tip with an arrow.   
>  
>*parato no ca attato.*  
>  
>**Thag 20.1**

Why is it such a subtle and difficult thing to discern the aggregates as such? I mean, can't I simply enumerate "*this* form, *this* form, *this* form, any form whatsoever at all is impermanent, not me, not mine, not I am"? And the same for the other aggregates? That doesn't sound like such a difficult thing to do compared to the analogy given which is splitting a hair-tip with an arrow.

Is this perhaps related to the fact that discerning *any* form, far or near, large or small, with all its various permutations, is difficult to do? I don't really know how to do this apart from holding a thought of 'all form' -- which would extend an open awareness to discernable forms within the visual field -- and directing the idea of anicca towards it.

Now the other issue here is discerning consciousness; it cannot even be discerned because it escapes any attempts at discernment. Consciousness necessarily has to come first for there to be any discernment anyways, the fact that there is discernment means there is consciousness. Everything affirms the existence of consciousness (it is the that-because-of-which-everything-is) and there's an idea of permanence associated with it partly due to this fact.

Well, maybe I should reflect on what I mean by 'discerning' since perhaps this is in some sense its discernment. But either way, I cannot *observe* by any means, the change in consciousness. I can indirectly relate the presence of consciousness (through their even being the discernment of this body) to this enduring body, but then question whether consciousness and body really co-exist? Could it not be the case that this consciousness is more fundamental than the body and when the body ceases, there is only consciousness left?

I'm unsure. Maybe such a "subtle thing" is about "including the sense of self" into the picture as it is often discussed?

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1b2n8ws/rightly_discerning_aggregates_is_like_penetrating/ksnw5m8/)** _2024-02-29 07:01:58:

    >I'm unsure. Maybe such a "subtle thing" is about "including the sense of self" into the picture as it is often discussed? 

    
    Yes. Even the most untrained puthujjana can see *instances* of form, feeling, etc. and know them as impermanent, etc. But what is subtle and hard to do is see those peripheral, more "personal" aspects of experience that you naturally takes for granted, and that endure *simultaneously* with the particular content, as also being within the aggregates. 

    
    A good example of this is the situation described in the [previous thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1b0g1ix/questions_on_the_samanadipa_vids/), where one recognizes that the attempt to even contemplate things and "practice" which seems fine superficially is underlain by a subtler aversion to the present feeling . That is a real part of your experience/five aggregates that is not recognized *while it's there*. 

    
    But if you embark on a quest to "catch" such background intentions and inclinations with your direct attention, you will for that very reason fail to see them, and there will be pressures and attitudes lurking underneath *that* activity you're engaging in. They are always there **in regard to** the things you attend to directly. To use Ajahn Nyanamoli's simile, it's like those stars in the sky that are seen only *as peripheral* to other starts, and disappear the moment you try to zone in on them. Knowing the aggregates as they are requires you to have sufficiently grasped the signs of the mind/developed sufficient yoniso manasikara, and that means being able to recognize these overlooked phenomena. 

    
    This is why the Buddha compared the aggregates to a murderer who earns your trust and kills you when you don't expect it. The way the householder in the simile places trust in that person and doesn't suspect them is analogous to how one overlooks the peripheral aspects of the five aggregates where all the assumptions and wrong attitudes become established. 

    
    To extend the simile, people would instead tend to think of the aggregates as things they can see from afar as they're approaching, and that's how the naive methodical and systematic attitudes toward the practice come about. You'd think you escaped the danger by warding off and "antidoting" these obvious thoughts and pressures and focusing on objects, while you continue to commune with the murderer. 

    
     Edit: The Sutta with the relevant simile is SN 22.85

### Questions on the Samanadipa vids


Theruwan saranai! These are some questions I have had for some time while listening to and contemplating Samanadipa's set of new videos. Forgive the length, as usual! 

1. In "Discerning the Middle Way", Bhante Anigha (I presume) points out that discernment of intentions should be about discerning one's attitude towards feeling, not about what one would state as their intention if one were to be asked. 

The example given in the video (34 min) is that intentions such as "I want to be admired/ understood" that go unnoticed while in company are closer to the sort of intentions you want to be discerning, NOT intentions like  "I-am-sweeping-today-bc-there-is-no-time-to-sweep-tomorrow", for ex.

My question is - what exactly is wrong with discernment of intentions in the way mentioned in the sweeping example?

 From my personal experience, it's possible that one COULD in fact be sweeping simply because it is a practical thing that happens to need to be done now ... NOT out of some sort of emotional compulsion or distraction, restlessness, desire, and so on. 
One may happen to feel neutral while sweeping, but that doesn't necessarily mean that they are sweeping BECAUSE they feel neutral. Action doesn't need to come OUT OF feeling, does it - action can be PARALLEL to feeling instead. 

To give an example of this "parallelness":
 I was listening to Dhamma talk yesterday afternoon and when I reflected on why I was doing it, I found that though my mood was pleasant while listening - I was not listening BECAUSE it was pleasant. Basically, the pleasant feeling was there, but was not the reason for me choosing to engage in that particular task. I could have just as easily sat quietly or read some suttas instead, without much mental resistance. 

In another instance, the same intention of wanting to listen to a talk arose with an almost palpable urge/pull to experience the pleasure of distraction. At that time, I wouldn't have been able to so easily choose to do something else - since in that state of mind, NOT distracting myself would be experienced unpleasantly. Acting OUT OF feeling. 

2. Yesterday morning I woke up in a pretty bad mood (the ambiguously nauseous kind). I then decided to "let the displeasure endure", and contemplated how the displeasure arose on its own and I had no say in it being there.

 Later, upon reflection, I realized that ALL of it - the "enduring", the contemplation - were ALL rooted in a subtle hope in my experience that my efforts would GET RID OF the bad mood. That the endurance would make the displeasure vanish once I got it right.  So what I initially thought to be khanti was fully enclosed within AVERSION (but not at the coarse level I'd usually see it in). 

Another time, I was sitting and was considering what topic I should choose to contemplate on, when I questioned myself why I wanted to contemplate in the first place. The answer was a subtle pressure towards the possibility of the peaceful feeling that often arises during contemplation. I then reflected that my entire intention to contemplate was rooted in a desire for pleasant feeling. If I did decide to contemplate anything other than my present situation there, my contemplation would have been WITHIN desire. 

Would these examples be more along the lines of how I should be discerning intentions in terms of one's attitude towards feeling? The push towards pleasure, the push away from pain - that dominate and envelop one's entire situation?

    >From my personal experience, it's possible that one COULD in fact be sweeping simply because it is a practical thing that happens to need to be done now ... NOT out of some sort of emotional compulsion or distraction, restlessness, desire, and so on. One may happen to feel neutral while sweeping, but that doesn't necessarily mean that they are sweeping BECAUSE they feel neutral. Action doesn't need to come OUT OF feeling, does it - action can be PARALLEL to feeling instead..

    That's true. But most people would not be seeing it that way when they hear the expression "the intention behind the action". They would often tend to review the logical/rational reasons for doing it at the expense of checking whether there is emotional pressure at the background pushing them to do it.

    When the action is "parallel" to the pressure as you put it and not rooted in it, then the stated reason for the action is irrelevant. You could even be misjudging the situation and making a mistake on worldly terms, but in terms of Dhamma the mistake is acting out of craving.

    >In another instance, the same intention of wanting to listen to a talk arose with an almost palpable urge/pull to experience the pleasure of distraction. At that time, **I wouldn't have been able to so easily choose to do something else** - since in that state of mind, NOT distracting myself would be experienced unpleasantly. Acting OUT OF feeling.

    Yes, and this is one instance where one would easily assume it's automatically fine because it's superficially a wholesome action. And the highlighted part is key in recognizing what is underlain by unwholesome intentions and what isn't.

    >Later, upon reflection, I realized that ALL of it - the "enduring", the contemplation - were ALL rooted in a subtle hope in my experience that my efforts would GET RID OF the bad mood.

    >Would these examples be more along the lines of how I should be discerning intentions in terms of one's attitude towards feeling? The push towards pleasure, the push away from pain - that dominate and envelop one's entire situation?

    Indeed, that's what is meant by an "underlying tendency", and also by "grasping the signs of the mind". The unskilled monk in SN 47.8 is superficially doing the work and genuinely thinks he's cultivating the right context. But behind that effort there would be a more subtle aversion (or delight and anticipation for an experience of relief), and because he doesn't see *that*, he can't possibly abandon the hindrances because he's, as it were, infecting himself in his very attempt to cure the infection, just not in the obvious way he'd be aware of.

    Seeing the attempt to get rid of a bad mood and including even that within what you're enduring and contemplating would be a quintessential example of "enduring things on the right level", and those more subtle intentions could not become palpably apparent to someone who isn't virtuous and restrained.

    Also, it's exactly this type of "subliminal" intention that is perpetually there during the deliberate implementation of a meditation method or technique, and people are not training themselves one bit towards grasping the signs of those intentions with that, since they're necessarily focused on what to "do" and the expected results. In fact, it's wrong even if that "doing" is precisely the right endurance, forsaking of methods, and right contemplations that we talk about, not to mention if it's full on object-focusing.

    In other words, the tendency to turn anything into a method is simply the tendency to overlook the signs of the mind. Now if on top of that the *instruction* is also in the form of a method, then not only are you already an "unskilled cook", but you're also being encouraged to remain as one.

    You suffer because you resist unpleasant feeling and want it to be otherwise, or crave for pleasant feeling to increase (because not enough pleasure is unpleasant). It doesn't matter if the source of those feelings is something "internal" that feels as if it's personal and you're responsible for it, like a bad mood. If you develop khanti towards that internal domain, it would be impossible to be bothered by external things, as well as to act out of the inner ones.

    It boils down to what OP mentioned above

    >In another instance, the same intention of wanting to listen to a talk arose with an almost palpable urge/pull to experience the pleasure of distraction. At that time, **I wouldn't have been able to so easily choose to do something else** - since in that state of mind, NOT distracting myself would be experienced unpleasantly. Acting OUT OF feeling.

    The unwholesome "drives" are those where your mind would be nagging you if you don't give in to them. Things are unwholesome not when their *content* is like this or like that, but when there's clearly that pull of the mind underlying them (i.e. craving). It means that if you succumb in such cases, you are "spoiling" your own mind just like you would a child, by letting it have whatever they want if they only yell at you loud enough. But if the child is asking politely and it's clear that they won't get upset if you say no, then it's fine. Instead of saying "check the intention behind the action", you could say it's about checking whether there is an *impulse* behind the action or not.

    In the case of trying to get rid of a bad mood as above, it's unwholesome because it's rooted in that same kind of impetus, just on a much subtler level that won't become apparent until you have been practicing virtue, restraint, and are able to discern the signs of your mind to a significant degree on account of that. Only then does this deeper plane of wholesome vs. unwholesome become properly discernible. Otherwise, when you try to look on that "level", it can easily seem like everything is a problem (which is incidentally related to how concentration gets conceived as the freedom from unwholesome).

    It's possible for neutral actions like sweeping and going for walks (or even contemplating and trying to "endure" things) to be underlain by craving, but it's essentially pointless to even attempt to address that if the sensual, averse, and careless actions that entail a much greater degree of impulsivity, and that you *are* clearly aware of, have not been abandoned, hence *gradual* training.

    It makes no sense to place gold on a crucible for melting when there are still coarse impurities in it.

    >“Gold has coarse corruptions: sand, soil, and gravel. A panner or their apprentice pours it into a pan, where they wash, rinse, and clean it. When that’s been eliminated, there are medium corruptions in the gold: fine grit and coarse sand. The panner washes it again. When that’s been eliminated, there are fine corruptions in the gold: fine sand and black grime. The panner washes it again. When that’s been eliminated, only gold dust is left. A goldsmith or their apprentice places the gold in a crucible where they blow, melt, and smelt it. Still the gold is not settled and the dross is not totally gone. It’s not pliable, workable, or radiant, but is brittle and not completely ready for working. But the goldsmith keeps on blowing, melting, and smelting it. The gold becomes pliable, workable, and radiant, not brittle, and ready to be worked.

    >This means there are two problems with my discernment: 1.) it wasn't something one could call "peripheral" discernment, since I was directly attending to these intentions and - 2.) The "sign" of my mind was seen when it was NO LONGER the sign of my mind... Basically, I saw it only in hindsight.

    Sure, it'd have been ideal that you had noticed the issue right then and there. But the fact that you realized it at least in hindsight is already a step closer to the sign of the mind than not realizing it at all. If the recognition were truly null, it wouldn't even have occurred to you that that was a mistake. That means that on future occasions, there is at least *some* chance that you'd be able to grasp that "sign" while the underlying unwholesome intention is present and actual.

    >Discernment of one's intentions (as well as reflection in general) seems to me to necessarily depend on DIRECT ATTENTION. If I reflect and question myself on why I am doing something - whether it is acting out of feeling or not - this self-questioning/ reflection must depend on my directly attending to & thinking about how I feel, no? I am thinking, pondering, and considering things in experience... so how can this result in peripheral discernment?

    Well, it might seem to you now like this is "direct attention", but from the point of view of the average practitioner who doesn't live restrained enough, and is trying in vain to compensate for that by overriding the level of reflection and pondering with the "present moment", it's not.

    "Peripheral awareness" doesn't mean that you don't think about it at all and it must somehow magically appear by itself. It means that you are thinking and pondering about the phenomenon *while it's there*—in this case the subtle intention to get rid of a bad mood ***by*** "enduring it", instead of *actually* enduring it (which you must have picked up on beforehand to reflect on it in the first place, otherwise you'll remain "absorbed" in it).

    You fall from "peripheral awareness" when your attempt to contemplate the present phenomenon results in you trying to "replace" it with another one, which is what you would've been doing in the instance you mentioned: thinking and pondering about the nature of the bad mood or whatever it is so as to *get rid of it.* Or, when it's something pleasant, you would lose peripheral awareness by overlooking the manifestation of that experience (which is in itself not delight), and letting your mind rest on the particulars of it so you it can "squeeze" more out of it. In both cases, you end up overriding what was there on its own because you couldn't withstand its initial "weight"/pressure. But if you learn how to contemplate *concretely* (a.k.a. "peripherally"), even your active contemplation and reflection about the nature of that thing will not be interfering with it in either "direction", so to speak.

    A few talks that might clarify this further:[ "Don't Be Afraid To Question Yourself"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fs-DA5ISZVE&pp=ygUlaGlsbHNpZGUgaGVybWl0YWdlICBxdWVzdGlvbiB5b3Vyc2VsZg%3D%3D), ["The Meaning of Right Samadhi" ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53sSOqThO2A&pp=ygUcdGhlIG1lYW5pbmcgb2YgcmlnaHQgc2FtYWRoaQ%3D%3D), ["Meditation — The Right Kind of Questioning"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPPi7ielaaM&pp=ygUlaGlsbHNpZGUgaGVybWl0YWdlICBxdWVzdGlvbiB5b3Vyc2VsZg%3D%3D).

    And, really, essentially all of the Dhamma talks are meant to be "peripheral" reflections: the person is supposed to be seeing the things being discussed in their present experience, having them "at the foreground" of their attention, *while* the context of those very phenomena is being elucidated. It's really nothing mystical; it's the basic principle of how all reflection already works, but unfortunately it needs to be pointed out explicitly.

    The problem of the ordinary person is not that they don't know *how* to reflect, but that they [don't see the phenomena that they should be reflecting upon](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn2#mn2:5.3) (e.g., their own "hidden" intentions), because they don't see the signs of their mind, and on top of that they give in to the things that make it even harder to do so (sensuality, ill will, distraction).

### Free from sensual desire = free from fear?

Hi fellow practitioners, 

Would it be correct to say that one free from the fetter of sensual desire would concurrently have eliminated all possibilities of fear and anxiety to arise? 
(as the non-returner / anagami, who is also free from ill will) 

That must be a sublime peaceful state!  

As greed & sensual desire is about obsessing about, wanting to obtain, or protecting this or that ‘pleasant thing’, and wishing to remove all ‘unpleasantries’ — once the underlying desire is uprooted, why would one even care? 
Whether things are pleasant, unpleasant or neutral, you have ‘no bets in the game’, you can’t win or lose. So logically, no fear would arise. 

Before coming across Ajahn Nyanamoli’s and HH’s teachings, I hadn’t deeply considered the ‘indirect’ approach of uprooting fear- and all suffering for that matter- by training oneself in virtue and sense restraint.

(Then there’s the question/curiosity of what happens to deeply rooted  “biological fears”, regarding survival for example - I would suppose anagamis, or even Arahants experience them as well- although as “first arrows” but no more. But maybe it’s fruitless to speculate on this point..) 

What do you think? Please share any related thoughts or comments you might have. 


Best wishes, 

A fearful person

    >Would it be correct to say that one free from the fetter of sensual desire would concurrently have eliminated all possibilities of fear and anxiety to arise? (as the non-returner / anagami, who is also free from ill will)

    Yes. What would remain for an anāgāmi is a subtler restlessness/agitation/uneasiness, not full-blown anxiety and fear.

    >(Then there’s the question/curiosity of what happens to deeply rooted “biological fears”, regarding survival for example - I would suppose anagamis, or even Arahants experience them as well- although as “first arrows” but no more. But maybe it’s fruitless to speculate on this point..)

    There's no such thing as a "deeply rooted biological fear". Certain especially forceful and threatening pressures exist for almost every set of 6 senses (e.g., a gun pointed at one's head), and each individual mind is either developed such that that *internal* threat does not turn into fear, or it isn't.

    >When a mendicant’s mind is rightly freed like this, even if potent sights come into the range of vision they don’t overcome their mind. The mind remains unaffected. It is steady, imperturbable, observing disappearance. Even if potent sounds … smells … tastes … touches … and phenomena come into the range of the mind-sense they don’t overcome the mind. The mind remains unaffected. It is steady, imperturbable, observing disappearance.

### What exactly is Anatta?

Is it a mindset of not regarding things as not self, or is it the thought that there really is no self.

A lot of teachers have different takes on this I would love to see what HH takes on this as well as more experienced posters in this sub.

  
Also I want to apologize if my point is not clear enough. English is not my first language, I hope everyone can understand.

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1aynqlc/what_exactly_is_anatta/krx7jch/)** _2024-02-24 14:26:25:

    *Anattā* is about the fact that the aggregates are ultimately not in your control, as demonstrated by MN 35 and SN 22.59. It's not about whether you *deliberately* call things "me" and "mine" or not, and it's also not a metaphysical statement in the style of "God does not exist" that you just "agree" with or not.

    You gauge how much you have understood *anattā* not by your intellectual understanding of fancy ideas, nor the attainment of mystical experiences through meditation, but by reflecting on how deeply you'd suffer if you lost the things that are dear to you (or failed to acquire them in the first place).

    The degree of suffering that arises there is the amount of control that is assumed over the aggregates, and thus the degree to which a self, in the sense of a master of the experience, is still assumed. Whether you then "believe" that "in ultimate reality there is no self" is irrelevant.

    >This to me felt like a first arrow type of reaction to the situation (my body is doing this crying thing) as opposed to the second arrow of pain in reaction to the situation. Although it was emotional, it didn’t feel like suffering. I wonder if I am thinking about this correctly?

    You wouldn't be able to not experience the second arrow only in certain situations. In other words, unless you've got the Right View once and for all, then whenever you don't suffer, it *has* to be because the first arrow was not as strong. And of course, with the Right View comes freedom from doubt, so in that case you would be fully certain that the second arrow cannot return.

    It's important to recognize that sometimes the feeling that accompanies certain perceptions can diminish, so that suffering would not accompany those same perceptions as much as it did for you before, or as much as it does for other people. Virtue and restraint alone can achieve that to a degree.

    But the freedom from the second arrow that a sotāpanna has gained is such that even when the feeling accompanying the perception *is* intense, when it truly has that existentially threatening "edge" to it, they still don't suffer. So it's no exaggeration to say that this is outright *inconceivable* from an ordinary person's point of view.

    If suffering is a liquid and the mind is a barrel, then the sotāpanna is not overwhelmed by suffering because the barrel simply has no bottom, not because there is a limit to the amount of liquid that comes in, nor a constraint on the types of liquid.

    Not if they "stay passive". One does needs to understand what right endurance is in order to become a sotāpanna. One's initial attempts will always be somewhere off the mark until that point.

    So yes, one doesn't necessarily need to "wrap one's head around" the *theory* per se, but about how to endure things correctly so that there is neither welcoming nor denying of mental states/aggregates. That understanding is not strictly theoretical, as it is achieved in a concrete or "experiential" manner through trial and error with virtue and restraint as its basis, but it is a form of understanding nonetheless that one previously didn't have.

    It's the concrete, "lived" understanding of the Middle Way that you wouldn't lose even after death, whereas all the theory and information would get erased.

### I am new to Buddhism and have watched a few videos by Hillside Hermitage, I don't get what the problem is with Orthodox or mainstream Therevada 



- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1avup7i/i_am_new_to_buddhism_and_have_watched_a_few/krgbugp/)** _2024-02-21 14:33:57:

    "The problem" is not mainly some specific point of doctrine; it's the fact that people's spiritual practice in general, whether it be mainstream Theravada or anything else, hinges unwittingly on ignoring or covering up one's liability to suffering—in various ways ranging from simple to elaborate, and which may or may not have any common ground superficially—in order to achieve freedom from suffering, whereas the genuine Dhamma is about confronting your liability and uprooting it, so that there remains nothing at all that *could* make you suffer but which you didn't acknowledge so as to feel relief as soon as possible.

    Therefore, the liberation that lies at the end of mainstream approaches is such that some things *could* still make one who reaches it crave and suffer, hence it's not true liberation. Peace would be there only for as long as one happens not to experience those things, no matter how unlikely and distant they are.

    Edit: All specific disagreements in doctrine are a consequence of this fundamental difference.

    >As I understand it, various meditation teachers (ex: Mahasi) do teach how to totally "uproot suffering" through developing wisdom. I do not know any authentic teacher of meditation who teaches mere suppression of "suffering".

    This is why I wrote "hinges *unwittingly".* It's obvious enough that nobody would be teaching something and calling it Dhamma while fully knowing that it's only managing things superficially (unless they're deliberately deceiving people, which I assume is rare). It goes without saying that almost every teacher would not only claim but be inwardly certain that their approach leads to uprooting suffering.

    But what all these practices have in common is that when things that cause suffering arise, you do something to get rid of *them*, and not to train your mind in such a way that they no longer cause suffering whether they arise or not. And with "they" I mean not only perceptions and thoughts, but emotional states which are also ultimately not in one's control, and arise due to contact.

    You would be free—regardless of what method you used to arrive at it, even if it supposedly involved the 4NT, the three characteristics, and so on—because you no longer experience certain feelings and mental states, and that's also partly due to a sheltered environment.

    Put someone who has come to an advanced stage of practice through these methods in a situation where their life  and well being is in very acute and immediate danger for a sufficient amount of time, and their peace would wear away. The internal pressures and disturbances that they achieved relief from by covering them up would forcefully come back, and they would not be able to help but to identify with them, appropriate them, or try to get rid of them.

    A person trained in true uprooting would be able to remain unperturbed *despite* the arising of such internal threats stemming from the aggregates themselves, because they have practiced the right context of non-ownership in regard to *any* feeling, instead of practicing mindfulness with the covert purpose of dampening what they feel.

    The latter would remove the suffering because the *trigger* for craving was taken away, not because the tendency to craving itself was uprooted.

### Upadana and Knowledge outside of the five aggregates?

So one experiences a feeling and the mind's automatic reaction to get rid of it or want more of it.

If one chooses to act out of this automatic intention by body, speech or mind because one thinks of these intentions as mine (upadana), isn't think process also expressed as a sankhara (mental activity)? Thus making it also within the five aggregates?

Also side question: can knowledge of the characteristics of the five aggregates can also been seen as the absense of upadana?

Thanks in advance

    >If one chooses to act out of this automatic intention by body, speech or mind because one thinks of these intentions as mine (upadana), isn't think process also expressed as a sankhara (mental activity)? Thus making it also within the five aggregates?

    Yes, the saṅkhāras that are there when avijjā is there are saṅkhāras (\*"\*with ignorance as condition, activities"). But you can't characterize that as "thinking processes" because that implies a person can just decide to become aware of them and remove them, whereas those things are there *because* you can't see them even when you try; that's what ignorance is. Ignorance means *not knowing,* not just "forgetting to check". That's why it's a massive contradiction when people think that they first "catch" their defilements and then "let go" of them by doing this or that.

    There is no interval between recognizing upādana or craving correctly and giving them up.

    >can knowledge of the characteristics of the five aggregates can also been seen as the absense of upadana?

    Therefore, yes.

    Upādāna is the lack of knowledge of the upādāna-aggregates, and absence of upādāna is knowledge of the upādāna-aggregates, which means there are no upādāna-aggregates anymore.

    Point being, you can't know upādāna *as* upādāna and still have it.

    Yes, a false sense of certainty is one of the symptoms of assumption, in this case the assumption of sensuality. But you could lose the sense of certainty and start doubting sensuality while still having the assumption, because it's more deeply rooted than that.

    A sensual act is determined most acutely by the "perversion of perception", whereby you regard getting yanked by something as pleasant because it's *content* is pleasant, not seeing that the context of something being imposed on you and pressuring you whether you like it or not makes it be fundamentally unpleasant no matter how agreeable it is.

    >Pre right view, upādāna is part of five aggregates as saṅkhāras with ignorance as it's condition.

    >Post right view, knowledge can be seen as lack of upādāna. Thus by definition it's outside of the aggregates.

    You have to distinguish between the five aggregates (pañcakkhanda) and the five assumed aggregates (pañcupādānakkhanda). You could say knowledge takes you "outside" of the five assumed aggregates (because lack of knowledge is what determines them), but not outside the five aggregates. Nothing whatsoever can be outside of form, feeling, perception, activities, and consciousness, but there can be an end to upādāna.

    >For someone with right view there is still upādāna when mindfulness is not present, correct?

    Yes, but never to the same degree as a puthujjana. And that upādāna would only be regarding sensuality, not views, virtue and duty, and selfhood. That remaining upādāna would be there when a sotāpanna strays from the noble eightfold path they acquired.

>  
>*AN 4.199, Ven. Thanissaro*

I used to think I gave up gossiping and coarse forms of discussion of other people, what they do, why they do what they do, and so on. But I realized that wasn't the case today and also found out that I'm almost like a zombie mindlessly talking without any particular reason; it's like that image of a donkey with a carrot in front of it: it'll just pursue it mindlessly, thinking that by moving in that direction it'll *eventually* end up getting what it wants, but never *actually* getting it. There's just some vague ambiguous goal of "perfected pleasure" (the carrot) that I'm seeking, which I never actually reach; my verbalization is a manifestation of this. It's just constant useless blabbering.

Perhaps this is the nature of craving as a whole, but it just became clear as day to me right now, and only in the instance of speech. Perhaps the whole notion of "moving with the grain" is just this constant mindlessness and zombie-like behavior?

But more specifically, when I analyze my speech (internal & external), it's entirely composed of "I" or "others"; the *exact* same permutations mentioned in the sutta above. More precisely, the locus here is "I" against which there are "others"; every discussion of how others are, are not, is related to how I am, or am not. So the fundamental basis for this verbalization is as the sutta points out, the notion of "I am". Even right now, I have a tendency to unnecessarily provide details and examples about **me**.

My reason for restraining this currently is simply because it's unnecessary. But I wish to know what the sutta means here so that I can reflect on a better reason. It seems to be positing some relationship between craving and conceit, and I've never been able to understand this relationship. I understand (theoretically) the relationship between craving and the sense of "mine", but what does craving have to do with "me or I am"? Why are those verbalizations particularly *craving*\-verbalizations? It seems to imply that the removal of craving would also annihilate such manners of thinking; why? What is the danger in regarding something as "me" or thinking in terms of the various permutations of "I am"?

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1av8m05/reflection_on_conceit_and_speech/krbe2nx/)** _2024-02-20 17:05:20:

    The Pāli is *taṇhāvicarita*, which means literally "craving-roaming" or "craving-wandering", not "craving-verbalization".

    What's being referred to here is the *context* behind your thinking, whether or not you ever verbalize the words "I" or "mine". Having such contexts present more strongly might *result* in a person talking about themselves a lot, but that would be one of the many secondary symptoms of appropriation that can be superficially managed and suppressed; it's not the illness itself.

    These tendencies can only be overcome if one has recognized the sense of self as a phenomenon rightly and learned to put it second, which makes there be no need to micromanage your speech. You would naturally talk less about yourself without actively trying, while still freely using the words "I" and "mine" when necessary, and without any of these permutations of craving being there.

    One cannot simply choose to not regard things as self, because it will result in the "seeing not-self with self" that MN 2 refers to. As the Sutta implies, these ways of thinking are there because craving is there. If you deal with that (by first understanding what craving actually is), you pull out the actual root of it all, whereas if you just cut the branches by squashing and "antidoting" every sense of "I" or "mine" you become aware of, the root remains intact, and there will be appropriation in one of these 18 permutations as the overlooked context to that whole tactic.

### Yoniso manasikara

I’ve been listening closely and repeatedly to the below video trying to gain a better understanding of overcoming defilements with proper yoniso manasikara coupled with another’s utterance. Some what understandable when using the examples for the defilement of lust. But one of my main issues is the defilement of worry. So in the case of worry, would the proper attention to the root or womb be ignorance? Example (worry about job) or (worry about family issues) The womb in these instances being ingnorance in ownership or misappropriating things out of my control such as situations at a job or dealing with family. Or in other words I’m ignorant in thinking I can own or change bad situations and thus ignorance leads to the sankhara of ownership? Am I on the right track here? Thank you Dhamma family

    >But one of my main issues is the defilement of worry. So in the case of worry, would the proper attention to the root or womb be ignorance? Example (worry about job) or (worry about family issues) The womb in these instances being ingnorance in ownership or misappropriating things out of my control such as situations at a job or dealing with family. Or in other words I’m ignorant in thinking I can own or change bad situations and thus ignorance leads to the sankhara of ownership? Am I on the right track here?

    Well, as always, the first "root" or "womb" that you need to start investigating is your lifestyle. You can be trying to figure out how to attend to things correctly and whatnot, but fundamentally if you are still in coarse ways maintaining the dependence of your well-being on not only your own body and mind, but on sense pleasures and external possessions, then you can't be surprised if a lot of worries arise and you get overwhelmed by them, because as the Buddha said, where there is desire there will be acquisition, and with acquisition comes the need to protect. You could then find clever ways to cover up the worry, but the *liability* to worry will still be there for as long as desires are acted out of.

    There's only so much intensity of worry (and hindrances in general) that you can properly surmount and learn to be unaffected by without covering it up, and you will have more than that much if you don't keep the 8 precepts.

    Having said that, you can't really see ignorance as "the womb" directly, because ignorance can never be something you're concretely aware of. It's by definition beyond your immediate reach.

    Instead, while the worries are there, you need to find a reference point that allows you to maintain perspective and not be going "with the grain" of the worry, but without ending up suppressing it and replacing it with something else entirely. For example, knowing that while you're worried, you're feeling displeasure, or while you're worried, your body is there, liable to sickness, aging, and death.

    That's all there is to it, and the failure to do it properly is in the fact that the mind will be veering either towards not recognizing the context clearly enough, or emphasizing the context too much and losing sight of the whole situation and pressure to which that context applies, which makes it not be a context any longer and defeats the whole purpose. You don't need to "resolve" the hindrance which is what most people would be trying to do; you simply need to keep perspective in face of it.

    When the context has been sustained properly long enough, then whatever you where thinking will not be a "worry" anymore, even if it's the same thing. That's because the worry (and the suffering) was not *in those thoughts*, but in your mind jumping into them head-on, so to speak. That becomes impossible if the context is clear and stable to the point where it's impossible to forget it even if you make no effort to recollect it.

    Also, it's not about *constantly* attending to it as you would in a meditation technique. You only have to "refresh" it once you notice your mind actually *giving in* to the worry or whatever it may be. You don't lose the context *because* the hindrance is there, but because you act out of the hindrance, even by mind.

### What did the householders in the Buddha's time see to want to go into the homeless life?

The suttas and vinaya are filled with householders realizing some inherent danger in remaining as a layperson and it appears that that danger is so much that it overrides all their responsibilities. I can imagine an only son leaving his family to ordain being a significant threat to that family's well-being considering Indian societies are structured around their kids providing full support to their parents which is the case even today.

This is also my only obstacle towards ordination. Leaving my parents without properly fulfilling my duties to them feels like the biggest possible betrayal one could partake in to me. It's incomprehensible to me what kind of danger the people in suttas saw that it completely overrode this sense of duty that must've *also* been there for them and most likely in an ever more pressuring sense.

Like I remember reading a biography in *Great Disciples of the Buddha* regarding a monk who'd apparently seen worms die in a field and that was enough to arouse enough sense of urgency in him to ordain? First of all, is this even realistic? Secondly, if so, what is the danger that that monk must've seen to then want to ordain? And lastly, why is there such difference between now and then? Is this a difference in time or between individual tendencies, both, neither?

I do recall there being a sutta that differentiated between the individuals whose sense of urgency is aroused on account of hearing of sickness, old age and death, then individuals who have it aroused on account of seeing, and experiencing it themselves. But what quality is responsible for these varying discernments into the danger of remaining a lay person?

For context, I managed to find the relevant excerpts from the book and it turns out that that's apparently the backstory of Ven. Mahakassapa (named Pipphali as a layperson):

>He was named Pipphali. His father owned sixteen villages over which he ruled like a little king, so Pipphali grew up in the midst of wealth and luxury. Yet already in his youth he felt a longing to leave the worldly life behind and hence he did not want to marry. When his parents repeatedly urged him to take a wife, he told them that he would look after them as long as they lived but that after their deaths he would become an ascetic. Yet they insisted again and again that he should take a wife, and thus just to comfort his mother he finally agreed to marry—on the condition that a girl could be found who conformed to his idea of perfection.  
>  
>For that purpose he commissioned goldsmiths to fashion for him a golden statue of a beautiful maiden. He had it bedecked with fine garments and ornaments and showed it to his parents, saying: “If you can find a maiden like this for me, I shall remain in the home life.” But his mother was a clever woman and thought: “Surely my son must have done deeds of merit in the past, and he must have done them together with a woman who is the counterpart of this golden image.” Thus she approached eight brahmins, showered them with rich gifts, and asked them to take the image and travel around in search of a human likeness of it. The brahmins thought: “Let us first go to the Madda country, which is a gold mine of beautiful women.” There they found at Sāgala a girl whose beauty equalled that of the image. She was Bhaddā Kapilānī, a wealthy brahmin’s daughter, age sixteen, four years younger than Pipphali Kassapa. Her parents agreed to the marriage proposal, and the brahmins returned to tell of their success.  
>  
>Yet Bhaddā Kapilānī too did not wish to marry. Like Pipphali, she longed to live a religious life and wished to leave home as a female ascetic. Such correspondence between her aspiration and that of Pipphali was not due to chance but sprang from the strong kammic bond they had forged in previous lives. Maturing in the present life, this bond was to unite them in marriage in their youth and to lead to a decisive separation later on—a separation which was again to be resolved by a union at a still higher level, when both consummated their spiritual endeavours by winning the supreme fruit of holiness under the Enlightened One.  
>  
>Pipphali was most distressed to hear that his plot had been foiled and that his parents had actually found a girl who matched the golden statue. Still intent on escaping from his agreement, he sent the following letter to the girl: “Bhaddā, please marry someone else of equal status and live a happy home life with him. As for myself, I shall become an ascetic. Please do not have regrets.” Bhaddā Kapilānī, likeminded as she was, independently sent him a similar letter. But their parents, suspecting such an exchange would take place, had both letters intercepted on the way and replaced by letters of welcome.  
>  
>So Bhaddā was taken to Magadha and the young couple were married. However, in accordance with their ascetic yearning, both agreed to maintain a life of celibacy. To give expression to their decision, each night they would lay a garland of flowers between them before they went to bed, resolving, “If on either side the flowers wilt, we shall understand that the person on whose side they wilted had given rise to a lustful thought.” At night they lay awake all night long from fear of making bodily contact; during the day they did not even smile at one another. As long as their parents lived they remained aloof from worldly enjoyment, and they did not even have to look after the estate’s farms.  
>  
>When Pipphali’s parents died, the couple took charge of the large property. **It was then that they felt the spur that set them on the course of renunciation**. One day, as Pipphali was inspecting the fields, he saw as if with new eyes something that he had seen so often before. **He observed that when his farm hands ploughed the land, many birds gathered and eagerly picked the worms from the furrows. This sight, so common to a farmer, now startled him. It struck him forcefully that what brought him his wealth, the produce of his fields, was bound up with the suffering of other living beings**. His livelihood was purchased with the death of so many worms and other little creatures living in the soil. Thinking about this, he asked one of his laborers: “Who will have to bear the consequences of such an evil action?”  
>  
>“You yourself, sir,” was the answer  
>  
>Shaken by that insight into kammic retribution, Pipphali went home and reflected: “If I have to carry along the burden of guilt for this killing, of what use to me is all my wealth? I would be better off giving it all to Bhaddā and going forth into the ascetic life.”  
>  
>But at home, at about the same time, **Bhaddā had a similar experience**, seeing afresh with a deeper understanding something she had very often seen before. Her servants had spread out sesamum seeds to dry in the sun, and crows and other birds ate the insects that had been attracted by the seeds. When Bhaddā asked her servants who had to account morally for the violent death of so many creatures, she was told that the kammic responsibility was hers. Then she thought: “If even by this much I commit evil, I won’t be able to lift my head above the ocean of rebirths even in a thousand lives. As soon as Pipphali returns, I shall hand over everything to him and leave to take up the ascetic life.”  
>  
>*Great Disciplies of the Buddha, p. 105*

So it seems that their families were both quite wealthy and so that sense of duty must've not been so heavy even though it was still likely there, but it seemed to have not bothered either one considering they were both quite intent on renunciation from a fairly young age (16, and 20). I understand inherently wanting to remain celibate, not get married, not inclining towards proliferation of sexual desires, wanting them to lessen, not being passioned with regards to the world. However, the rest of the story seems odd.

It seems that it wasn't because of the death of the animals that they'd gone forth but rather some understanding into the metaphysical notions of karma that also don't seem to fair up well with my own understanding currently. For instance, why are they ones who'll have to "bear the consequences for such evil actions" when that's not even something they've intended?

However, the general point still remains that there seems to be some danger seen in remaining as a layperson throughout all the people who wish to go into homelessness that apparently I cannot see. But if such a danger does in fact exist, then I would like to see it.

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1aropkz/what_did_the_householders_in_the_buddhas_time_see/kqteys6/)** _2024-02-17 09:47:16:

    It's not like you're missing some piece of information that will reveal you the danger. The mind fails to see things as they are not because it hasn't been *told* the way they are, which is certainly necessary, but because of its own defilements that haven't been cleared up.

    Some people's starting point might naturally be less cluttered with obstructions, and that is why some people would without even needing a lot of instruction, incline towards renunciation just by hearing about the misfortunes of someone else (AN 4.113).

    (The story about Mahā Kassapa is commentarial and thus most likely fictitious).

    The only way to clear up these obstructions is as always adherence to the gradual training. There is some possibility, depending on whether you're wearing away things properly or not, that the danger that you already know intellectually would one day become apparent enough to push you to ordain.

    But waiting for that is always a risky choice, because nobody has an outside view of their own situation, and it's impossible to be sure that the way you are practicing and living now is genuinely training your mind properly except in hindsight. It is perfectly possible that taking the plunge and ordaining is exactly the push that would help you to take on the practice on the right level, which you (unwittingly) may not have been doing before, or it could also be that you would eventually see the danger just by practicing in your current environment, but after so long that by the time you felt inspired to go forth, it would be too late—assuming you live that long, to begin with.

    Choosing to maintain the status quo until something magically changes is always unwise; at the very least you should be striving further in renunciation whether or not you ordain. Renunciation is also a gamble from one's initial point of view affected by ignorance, but the difference is that even if you don't "win", the only loss it can result in is only worldly and transient, no matter how much it hurts.

    >How is renunciation a gamble? Is it because one doesn't yet know what renunciation truly is? Or that one doesn't know the kind of renunciation that's conducive to liberation?

    I meant it just in the sense that when you're starting out you never know for sure that liberation is possible or that you'll achieve it. Since the mind still values sensual pleasures inherently, it'll feel like you're taking the risk of missing out on something that you already have in exchange for something you're not sure even exists.

    >But I still don't understand how it is a gamble. Whatever has been let go of has only been freeing -- even though it may be through that management kind of renunciation.

    But yes, if you just go through with it even partially, you would start to see for yourself that renunciation is actually more pleasant. At that point you can then reason that that ease of renunciation is closer to what Nibbāna is than any other fancy ideas you might have about it.

    >The only issue is that I do not see how I can just "switch" to that non-management kind of renunciation, it seems wholly inaccessible.

    You can't just "switch" to it by choice. It's more like you simply need to be aware that there is always more to even the basic virtue than what you already have unless you're a sotāpanna, otherwise you'll start to think this part of the work is done and now it's time for something else, which is how most people go off track.

    So there might be a tendency to try to get rid of the desires and so on, but as long as you not only keep the precepts and restraint but also question and investigate yourself and avoid becoming content with that, it will become apparent how you can start to refine it and go beyond management. You don't use the fact that your restraint won't be perfect as a reason to not do it, because that's how it'll certainly remain less than perfect.

    We all start out wrong, and there's nothing we can immediately do to change that. The real problem is when you overlook that fact, either because nobody told you or because you didn't make enough effort to remind yourself.

### Resistance is suffering

Hello, I'm looking for some clarifications about tanha and assumption of sensuality.

In Ajahn Nyanamoli's book I found this passage on the assumption of sensuality:

&#x200B;

>**The Only Way to Jhana - Chapter 4 : Desire to end desire**  
>  
>Taṇhā is more on an immediate level of your attitude towards your present enduring feeling, whatever it is. That attitude is always rooted in resistance. Even if there is craving for pleasure, that is rooted in you resisting the current feeling, which is not in itself unpleasant, but it’s not sufficient—the pleasure is not sufficient, which is why you crave for more pleasure—which means, it’s painful.  
>  
>Any resistance is painful, and with the mind of resistance, if you experience pleasure, you will be resisting it by default, because by default, you want more of it. With the mind not free from taṇhā, when you experience pain, you’re resisting it by default, because you don’t want any of it. You want it to completely go away. With the mind not free from taṇhā, when you experience a neutral feeling, you will automatically resist it, you will incline towards oblivion, towards ignoring it, towards turning away from it, because you don’t understand it. Taṇhā, practically speaking, is always that resistance on the level of what you’re currently feeling.  
>  
>Q: Even if you’re feeling pleasure, you’re still resisting it. It’s not good enough for you.  
>  
>Nm: Absolutely. That’s why if you’re not free from craving, every pleasure will be underlain by craving for more. With the presence of resistance, there is the presence of dissatisfaction. Presence of taṇhā means dukkha is there, presence of dukkha means taṇhā is there.  
>  
>If taṇhā is still present, that means that there is still resistance to whatever feeling is there for you at the time, and that’s why you suffer: not because of what is felt, but because of that resistance. And why would you be resisting? Why is it that you’re not content with an agreeable feeling that is present? Why is it, that by default, the mind wants more of it? It’s because of the wrong view in regard to what pleasure is, what sensuality is, and what gratification is.  
>  
>Sensuality is a form of upādāna, an assumption. It’s basically the view and the values that you uphold throughout your day-to-day existence. Sensual desire is felt unpleasantly and that’s why you want to gratify your senses, because non-gratified senses hurt. However, your resistance is the suffering there, and so if you stop resisting the non-gratified senses, they’ll stop hurting and there will be no suffering there despite the senses being ungratified. But when you don’t see that the suffering is on the level of your resistance, you think suffering exists because of the non-gratification of the senses, and so you go out and seek gratification, and that’s why you keep perpetuating your suffering.  
>  
>So first, you need to stop seeking out the gratification of the senses, so that your resistance to the non-gratified senses becomes apparent as the cause of your suffering. Only then can you realise, ‘Oh, I stop resisting, it stops hurting’. Which means that gratifying the senses becomes redundant. The habit of resistance (craving) perpetuates the sensuality view that non-gratified senses cause suffering and gratified senses means freedom from suffering.  
>  
>Taṇhā feeds kāmupādāna—the assumption of sense desire, and the kāmupādāna feeds taṇhā. It’s a vicious circle, it has no beginning. It’s not that you were pure, then you develop taṇhā, and then you develop upādāna. No, you start already infected, perverted, mistaken, confused, assumed. Corruption is beginningless. And that’s why if you understand it, if you uproot the gratuitous assumption or the craving, both will be uprooted and cannot revert back. That uprooting is irreversible.

&#x200B;

I'm really just looking for confirmation or correction, could anyone please tell me if my understanding is correct or if anything is missing or misinterpreted please?

&#x200B;

**Sensual desire in regard to feeling** : resistance to the current feeling that add a layer of suffering on top of the current feeling because the ~~sense~~ mind wants to have what it doesn't have (either more pleasantness or less unpleasatness)

**Pleasant feeling** : resistance towards it because wants more of it

**Unpleasant feeling** : resistance towards it because don't want it

**Neutral feeling** : resistance towards it because don't want it (don't understand it)

&#x200B;

So roughly speaking are these the steps to see the way out of kamupadana and eventually free oneself from tanha all together after refinement?

1. Any contact is there accompanied with feeling, there is sensual desire in regard to this feeling, meaning resistance to it
2. Resistance to the feeling hurts so want to gratify the sense so it doesn't hurt anymore
3. Stop resisting the feeling and it will stop it hurting so there is no need to gratify it anymore
4. We are left with only the current feeling

    >So roughly speaking are these the steps to see the way out of kamupadana and eventually free oneself from tanha all together after refinement?

    Yes, but point #3 is where the vast majority of the work lies. Learning how to stop resisting feelings without that turning into a subliminal attempt to get rid of them is what takes a long time.

    >Is the first and the second arrow contained in this small expression of paticassamupada?

    No, that's not really how PS works. Paṭiccasamuppāda is not giving you an "explanation" of how everyone's experience comes to be, like a sort of quasi-scientific universal principle of the mind. It's a description of a puthujjana's suffering—of his *assumed* aggregates and what they depend on. It's a description of the second arrow alone.

    When there is no suffering, it's because the entire thing did not take place at all, starting with ignorance. The feeling that is there on the basis of contact is already suffering because it already involves ignorance. The five aggregates free from assumption, i.e., that are not dukkha, are not within paṭiccasamuppāda.

### Hello

Hello,

I recently discovered this community, I have gone through many of the posts here and other forums and many videos on the youtube channel as well, just tried proper sense restraint for past few days and I am convinced.

My main question is, since developing the right view involves a lot of critical analysis, the "peripheral view" of different kinds of sensuality whilst staying present with whatever comes up (forgive me for my simplistic and maybe erroneous reduction), if a person is not intelligent enough to properly do the critical analysis, how can one bring one's abilities to that level, is that possible, if so how can I do it? I will start going through all of the HH youtube videos carefully, start reading the suttas , Ajahn Nyanamoli's books/ essays, but would appreciate any other tips. Thank you!

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1aq4cz4/hello/kqctz2w/)** _2024-02-14 07:20:45:

    Not being *as* able to perform what you call the "critical analysis" and not being able to wrap one's head about all the theoretical nuances is not the central obstacle on the path.

    The only true insurmountable obstacles on the path are: 1) Trivializing/underestimating avijjā and the Dhamma 2) Lack of renunciation, virtue and sense restraint.

    In order to not fall into #1, all one has to do is regard the idea that one is already partaking in even one of the factors of the Noble Eightfold Path as to good to be true. That will ensure that, despite inevitably still having certain misunderstandings, one will at least not be *cultivating* them by failing to be sufficiently skeptical towards one's own practice., and failing to treat the Dhamma with due respect.

    This is the reason for our continuous insistence on how there is no right meditation or understanding before one becomes a sotāpanna. Anything less than that attitude entails an unrealistic assessment of one's predicament of being immersed in ignorance, not realizing the sheer magnitude of it.

    As regards point #2, people's idea that they can practice the Dhamma without actually abandoning the actions that go against it is a result of point #1, but it's still worth a separate mention.

    If a person relentlessly makes sure to avoid those two pitfalls, they would realize the essence of all the more detailed and intellectually challenging stuff we teach eventually with only the Suttas as their guide. People back in the Buddha's day didn't have a tendency (or much less at least) for either of these two things, which is why so many of them realized the Dhamma without the need for so many technicalities.

    It's also how there are "faith types" who achieve enlightenment through faith. It's those people that go so intensely in the opposite direction of these two pitfalls that they can do without as much intellectual aid. "Faith" is not about a feel-good sense of blind devotion and admiration that has no direct bearing on your actions.

### Overcoming drowsiness and dullness?

Hi all, just want to ask for opinion regarding dealing with drowsiness and dullness.  


>SN 46.53  (I'm quoting parts from the sutta)  
>  
>When the mind is sluggish, it’s the right time to develop the awakening factors of investigation of principles, energy, and rapture. Why is that? Because it’s easy to stimulate a sluggish mind with these things.   
>  
>When the mind is restless, it’s the right time to develop the awakening factors of tranquility, immersion, and equanimity. Why is that? Because it’s easy to settle a restless mind with these things.  

What does it mean by developing the awakening factors of principles, energy and rapture when the mind is sluggish? Likewise for when the mind is restless?   

How does one stimulate the sluggish mind with principles, energy and rapture?  

How does one settle the restless mind with tranquility, immersion and equanimity?  

Does this investigation happens in sequence? 

i.e  

investigation of principle -> energy -> rapture 

developing tranquility -> immersion -> equanimity 

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1aovr9j/overcoming_drowsiness_and_dullness/kq9ehb2/)** _2024-02-13 17:38:15:

    To add to what SDCjp wrote, the awakening factors do not exist before stream-entry (SN 46.30) The very first factor, sati, is about recollecting one's right understanding. If one doesn't have it to begin with, one cannot recollect it.

    Besides that, the same principle applies to dullness and drowsiness as to all other hindrances: the hindrances are simply 5 manifestations of one's overall impulse to act on account of what's felt. So whatever one does to overcome a hindrance, it must not be operating under the same principle of wanting to get rid of whatever feeling is there, in this case the displeasure of a dull mind, no matter if in theory "dullness bad". It isn't in itself, just like any other mental state. What's bad is when you *act*, even mentally, out of the pressure of a mental state. Sāriputta for example became an Arahant by [knowing "sluggish mind" as "sluggish mind"](https://suttacentral.net/an7.39/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=sidebyside&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin), not by *doing* something to get rid of it. "Knowing it" means you are aware of it's presence to the extent that neither succumb to it, nor do you overshoot it and act as if you're entitled to control the arising of pressure (SN 1.1)

    If you try to get rid of any hindrance directly, what will always happen is you will end up feeding another hindrance in the process (trying to get rid of sensuality directly, people do asubha with aversion; trying to get rid of ill-will directly, people do mettā with longing and attachment; trying to get rid of sloth and torpor, people feed restlessness, etc.). There will always be a subtler hindrance motivating any such attempts.

    (Edit: If you're full on nodding, it's perfectly fine to get up and walk. Also, you shouldn't be meditating with eyes closed. That's almost a one-way ticket to wrong samādhi).

    On every occasion. When you close your eyes, you're automatically in La-La Land, which is what most people regard as "meditation".

    >Can you expand more on it Bhante? How do you contemplate or meditate? Do you not get distracted when you don't close your eyes? Do you feel bright room or dark room matters in the contemplation or meditation practice?

    Sense perceptions, as long as they're not accompanied by lust or aversion, are not distractions. *Moha* (distraction or delusion) is a mental choice that one must learn to recognize and restrain. It's not something that "just happens" to you merely by having functioning senses.

    >“Bhikkhus, possessing five things a bhikkhu is unable to enter and dwell in right composure. What five? Here, a bhikkhu is not forbearing with sights, not forbearing with sounds, not forbearing with smells,  not forbearing with tastes, not forbearing with touches. Possessed with these five things a bhikkhu is unable to enter and dwell in right composure"

    —AN 5.113

    This means that if one needs to shut away the senses in order to be free from delight and aversion, it is impossible that one's samādhi will be right. That's when one is practicing concentration/absorption instead proper samādhi.

    What one certainly does need to do is withdraw oneself from coarse distractions such as other people, which is why the Suttas always say the monk goes to the root of a tree, an empty hut, etc. The presence of other people is what *does* count as an impediment to the right kind of samādhi, even if they're perfectly silent and motionless in a dimly lit meditation hall.

### Metta abandons only ill will ?

I had some doubts about metta practice from one of  u/Bhikkhu_Anigha's comment on another post.

&#x200B;

>The sole purpose of practicing *mettā*, which is the foundation upon which the next 3 are built, is to [abandon ill-will ](https://suttacentral.net/an6.13/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin)

Is metta a practice just to overcome ill will? That makes no sense to me, How is it possible to overcome ill will without simultaneously overcoming sensuality? I know the approach to both practices are different and the themes you contemplate also vary but shouldn't diminishing ill will also diminish sensuality?

>They are able to "witness with the body" the cessation of a defilement

Does defilement here mean hindrance or something else? When you stop taking up hindrances and start seeing them arise at the level of the body, This vision applies to all hindrances, Either your mind is subjected to all the hindrances or it isnt subjected to any of them (pls correct me if i said something inaccurate). So When you "witness with the body the cessation of a defilement", I suppose this is to mean something other than "not taking up the hindrance of ill will and thus all hindrances" because these hindrances can rearise if you "loose" mindfulness. So, does "cessation of the defilement" mean the recognition that the hindrance of ill will has permanently subsided and can never reappear again even if you get distracted from your establishment of metta and no circumstance or loosing mindfulness can reintroduce ill-will back into your experience. If so, is it possible to be permanently free from one hindrance and be subjected to the rest?? I'm very confused about this part.

This excerpt is from the suttas.

>Take another mendicant who says: ‘I’ve developed the heart’s release by equanimity. I’ve cultivated it, made it my vehicle and my basis, kept it up, consolidated it, and properly implemented it. Yet somehow desire still occupies my mind.’ They should be told, ‘Not so, venerable! … For it is the heart’s release by equanimity that is the escape from desire.’

Does desire here mean sensual desire? When practicing brahmaviharas, does one have to develop their mind all the way to equanimity to be free from sensual desire? if so, Why is that? I cant see how one does not abandon sensuality alongside ill will.

Also is ill will and sensuality abandoned immediately by someone with the right view after establishing mind on metta or jhana and thus becoming anagami or is that a gradual turning away of the mind? Also, do you have to do further contemplations on the disgust of sensuality or the peril of ill will in order to free yourself once after you've established your mind on this greater context or is this process automatic?

Sorry to bother you with so many questions. This has been bugging me for a while

    I was not implying that mettā is some sort of direct "antidote" to ***ill-will only*** as people tend to understand it. mettā overcomes all the 5 hindrances, and all craving entirely if paired with Right View. What I meant with "sole purpose" is that the goal of mettā is not give rise to *pleasure* as people would think, but to train the mind to be unmoved by the displeasure that other people might generate. Being moved by that displeasure *is* what ill-will is.

    The usual way of practicing mettā is actually just another way of being moved by that displeasure, such that you feel the need to jump into feeling *affection* for the person instead so that the displeasure gets covered up. This is in its essence the same principle as sensuality: you can't endure the displeasure of not seeing, hearing, tasting, smelling or touching some object that is pulling your senses, and so you jump the get the pleasure of that object to distract you from the more fundamental discomfort of the senses being attacked by things beyond your control.

    Hence, mettā done rightly removes *all* tendencies for sense desire too. Mettā as generally practiced not only fails to address them—it's *driven* by those same underlying tendencies.

    >So, does "cessation of the defilement" mean the recognition that the hindrance of ill will has permanently subsided and can never reappear again even if you get distracted from your establishment of metta and no circumstance or loosing mindfulness can reintroduce ill-will back into your experience. If so, is it possible to be permanently free from one hindrance and be subjected to the rest?? I'm very confused about this part.

    In the context where I wrote that (certain ascetics who fully developed mettā outside the Buddha's dispensation), yes, it was a permanent abandonment of ill-will (and a permanent abandonment of sensuality by definition too). A puthujjana can be free from sensuality, which means they can also be free from ill-will.

    >If so, is it possible to be permanently free from one hindrance and be subjected to the rest?? I'm very confused about this part.

    So no, in that case they would've been freed from the other hindrances too. But they were still puthujjanas, so the fundamental level of ignorance remained. So as the Suttas say, they would be reborn in the same plane as an anāgami, but eventually after many eons they would fall back down into the sensual or lower realms. But of course, they would've become anāgāmis almost instantaneously if they'd heard the Dhamma, just like the Buddha's former teachers, but they never did.

    >Does desire here mean sensual desire? When practicing brahmaviharas, does one have to develop their mind all the way to equanimity to be free from sensual desire? if so, Why is that? I cant see how one does not abandon sensuality alongside ill will.

    No, that's a mistranslation. The word is *rāga* which is "passion". What remains when the first three brahmavihāras have been developed is a subtle residue of passion (more on the level of the passion for form or the formless that an anāgāmi still has, not *sensual* passion). That's what's abandoned through the final abiding of upekkhā. Sensuality would've already fallen away long before, through the very first brahmavihāra which is mettā.

    >Also is ill will and sensuality abandoned immediately by someone with the right view after establishing mind on metta or jhana and thus becoming anagami or is that a gradual turning away of the mind?

    Yes and no. As per AN 3.94, a sotāpanna who dies while the mind is free from hindrances would essentially die as an anāgāmi. But unless that happens, they are liable to fall back from that and be affected by sensuality and ill will at some point again. Repeated abiding in samādhi would be necessary to make the abandonment permanent.

    >Also, do you have to do further contemplations on the disgust of sensuality or the peril of ill will in order to free yourself once after you've established your mind on this greater context or is this process automatic?

    Those contemplations *are* what would establish the mind on that greater context and strengthen it once it's already there. That's what it means to "steady your mind" in jhāna and "make much of it" for example: clarify the danger of sensuality even more by reflecting on it, which indirectly increases the wholesome joy of withdrawal. It doesn't mean "get *absorbed on this object* even more".

    >Can a sotapanna abiding in jhana become an arahat by cultivating dispassion to that wholesome experience without technically becoming an anagami first (considering his mind hasnt turned away completely)?

    Yes. They're not "stages" that one needs to pass through necessarily.

    >Is this what constitutes a sakadagami? I suppose sakadagamis exist on a spectrum with some having minds almost fully turned away and close to the state of anagami and others with minds very similar to their previous sotapanna state. Is this correct?

    Yes, a noble disciple who can already attain jhāna and understands how to abandon the hindrances clearly would tend to be a sakadāgāmi at least.

    >Also, can this turning away of mind be percieved? I dont think its just citta nimitta at that point ?? Can someone abiding in the jhana know just how far his mind has given up the hindrances permanently?

    No, there's no sudden flash of light or fireworks. One would know the mind has given up the hindrances permanently when without any *samādhi*, in the midst of assailing sense objects, the mind still remains dispassionate. And to know what a dispassionate mind even is, one needs to have grasped the *cittanimitta*.

    >Sorry for picking your words like this, but by repeated, you do mean the length of time one abides in the states has to be of a sufficient duration and not that one has to restablish his mind in this state multiple times after falling away to make the state permanent right.

    No, the length of time is irrelevant. It's not like you're channeling some sort of energy by being in this "state". It means one has to strive in abandoning hindrances again and again over a long period of time, until the mind becomes totally familiar with what the hindrances are and "sees through them" all the time, no matter how outwardly busy you get.

    >Does discerning higher states of samadhi make the process of turning away faster?

    Not that it's "faster" as if you're waiting for some magical click to happen. Higher states of samādhi allow for the ordinary state of no samādhi to be understood and penetrated with wisdom even more clearly. (That's why "absorption" is so wrong; it *disassociates* you from your ordinary experience, and so it is useless in helping you overcome anything permanently).

### How to understand MN20 in relation to ‘Sīla is Samādhi’?

I’m having some trouble reconciling two teachings, hopefully you can help. In the ’Removal of distracting thoughts’ MN20, the Buddha teaches 5 methods to remove unskilful thoughts. He says…  


>When evil unskillful thoughts connected with desire, hate, and delusion arise in a bhikkhu through reflection on an adventitious object, he should, (in order to get rid of that), reflect on a different object which is connected with skill. Then the evil unskillful thoughts are eliminated; they disappear. By their elimination, the mind stands firm, settles down, becomes unified and concentrated  
>  
>getting rid of a coarse peg with a fine one

Then the other 4 methods: seeing danger, ignoring, stilling thought formation, ‘crushing mind with mind’.  


This seems to go against the idea of enduring unwelcome thoughts as taught in the essay ‘[Sīla is Samdhi](https://www.hillsidehermitage.org/sila-is-samadhi/)’. As reflected in the following passages:  


>…thoughts in the form of desires, annoyances, boredom/laziness, anxieties and doubts about various issues will inevitably come to the foreground of attention, …start trying to see how a different route than the usual two extremes that one is used to (indulgence and denial) could in fact be taken towards those mental states.  
>  
>it is one’s ***volitional lust***, one’s *deliberate choice to accept* the presented possibilities to try to “release” the mental pressure that is the problem  
>  
>It must be emphasized that the purpose of this contemplation of danger is not to get rid of the arisen *thought*, but to address one’s inability to remain *internally* unmoved by its alluring nature  
>  
>in the above Sutta, the man simply *refrains* from doing what would cause the lamp to burn longer than it should on its own. He doesn’t *manually* try to get the oil out or put out the fire. This is the only way to abandon an unwholesome state without generating another.  
>  
>you always *touched* the trap either to eat the bait or to throw it away, and that’s all the hunter needed to get you. But now, you are learning to not *take* the bait, nor try to *remove* it either

Initially I thought the Buddha could be referring to the removal of the 3 poisons, which would make sense with ‘not touching the bait’ of the thoughts. But that can’t be so as it distinctly says evil, unwholesome thoughts (connected with 3 poisons desire, hate, delusion), which is the same phrase used in the formula on sense restraint, (that without samvara such states would assail you), but in that case it is dhamma rather than vittaka.  


Many thanks to Bhikkhu Anigha for writing this essay, I feel like it will be a massive help in my practice. Best wishes.

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1amu2uw/how_to_understand_mn20_in_relation_to_sīla_is/kpqvdix/)** _2024-02-10 05:26:09:

    The confusion is rooted in an extremely common (including by translators) careless reading of the relevant passages, paired with a confirmation bias in favor of meditation techniques.

    >*Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno* ***yaṁ nimittaṁ āgamma*** *yaṁ nimittaṁ manasikaroto uppajjanti pāpakā akusalā vitakkā chandūpasaṁhitāpi dosūpasaṁhitāpi mohūpasaṁhitāpi, tena, bhikkhave, bhikkhunā tamhā nimittā aññaṁ nimittaṁ manasi kātabbaṁ kusalūpasaṁhitaṁ.* 

    >Take a bhikkhu who is attending to some ***sign*** that gives rise to harmful, unfavorable thoughts connected with desire, aversion, and muddledness. That bhikkhu should attend to a different ***sign*** connected with what's favorable.

    The Buddha also gives a simile:

    > Just as a skilled carpenter or his apprentice might knock out, remove, and **extract a coarse peg by means of a fine one,** so too…when a bhikkhu gives attention to some other sign connected with what is wholesome…his mind becomes steadied internally, quieted, brought to singleness, and concentrated.

    This is not saying that you should attend to a different *dhamma*/*vitakka,* which is what people interpret it as ("focus the mind on a *different* *object").* The word is *nimitta*, which absolutely does not mean "object", nor even "thought" or "mental image".

    SN 47.8 describes how a monk who cannot grasp the *nimitta* of his mind is unable to abandon the defilements. This is a a slightly  different context but the meaning of the word is the same. You cannot grasp the "object" of your mind, that's preposterous. What it's talking about, to put it simply, is noticing the *attitude* that your mind harbors towards this or that object, which is where the defilements are. It compares the monk who is able to notice that attitude with a cook who catches the subtle *signs* that reveal the king's predilection for certain dishes. The whole point is that those *nimittas* are not observable *objects* of perception, in which case there would be no possibility for the cook not to catch them unless he were blind, and the Buddha would've chosen a different simile.

    The *nimittas* that MN 20 refers to are on exactly the same level; it's certain attitudes that the mind holds towards this or that thing which is feeding the unwholesome thoughts. So only by first recognizing that attitude would one be able to "replace" it with an attitude connected with the wholesome. Replacing one *object* with another does nothing to the attitude, which is why it will remain the same. Also, notice that the simile is replacing one coarse peg with a finer, not replacing a coarse peg with *another* coarse peg, which is what happens when you simply switch to another object.

    Essentially, this is why meditation techniques are "meditation with sensuality". Because one cannot catch those *nimittas* of one's own attitude and can only cover up the underlying craving by attending to different *object*, the attitude of sensuality and the hindrances as a whole remain there. This is what AN 11.9 refers to with "harboring sensuality ***internally***, he meditates...."

    The main takeaway is that one needs to be willing to admit that one doesn't even know what craving and defilements are in order to do the work of uncovering these "signs", instead of conveniently assuming that by switching the object of attention, which even the most untrained, ignorant beginner could understand, the problem is solved. The purpose behind the Gradual Training is to contain the outpours of one's defilements so that gradually the signs of those defilements can become more and more apparent. It's by definition not something that the average person can even relate to, and is the primary reason why one wouldn't see the Four Noble Truths—insufficient recognition of the signs of the mind.

    It's because of this that MN 2 starts off by saying that the abandonment of defilements is "only for one who knows and sees", and not simply for one who can replace one object with another, i.e., everyone. These 5 strategies in MN 20 are in fact not even addressed to a puthujjana, because it talks about "one devoted to the higher mind", which would have to be a sotāpanna at least—precisely one who can grasp the signs of their mind. A puthujjana first needs to see clearly what desire, aversion, and delusion are in the first place, thereby getting the Right View, before they can properly implement these 5 strategies.

    (Edit: Another problem with the idea of "switching the object" is that it would only be applicable when you're sitting in "formal meditation", whereas what the Buddha is referring to here is the urgent task that can and should be carried out *at any time*, "as if one's head were on fire" as other Suttas say).

    >The 5 parts of MN20 (switching nimitta, see danger, ignore etc) are still aiming at the vanishing and going away of assailing vitakka. So the bhikkhu is practicing for the purpose of banishing those vitakka not recognising their safety in the presence of them.

    Yes, of course the Sutta is describing a situation in which *something* needs to be abandoned. It's not that one shouldn't do anything. But the key is that, as the passage says, it's the thoughts *connected with desire, aversion, and delusion* that need to go away. So by, for example. establishing the right attitude/context that is an infertile ground for those mental states to continue, *whatever* thoughts you have will no longer be affected by them, i.e. **you will now have thoughts** ***not*** **connected with desire, etc.** It doesn't necessarily mean that you will change the *object*; that would only be the case if there was no reason to be thinking about that object except the unwholesome. Say, if the mind was revolving around thoughts of food but there was no actual hunger to justify those thoughts, and it was just rooted in desire for that sense pleasure. But if there was a practical reason for you to be thinking about whatever it was then you would keep doing so without any unwholesome roots present.

    Once that principle is developed to the max—keeping in mind that this is simplifying it for the sake of explanation; in practice the undeveloped mind will fail to distinguish the unwholesome states clearly enough as in SN 47.8—there is *nothing* that the mind is being held hostage by, as it were. As it says at the end, you can think whatever you want to think and not think whatever you don't want to think, and there is no impetus born of hindrances behind any of that. The sense of relief that comes from that is the joy of the first jhāna.

    So it's actually the polar opposite of the common conception of jhāna involving being locked into one object. There's no *freedom* involved in that. It's just a nicer form of bondage that for an ordinary person would feel liberating even though it really isn't.

    >Another question about nimitta - in the standard sense restraint passage the Buddha mentions nimitta but also what is sometimes translated as a “secondary detail or characteristic”. (na nimitta·ggāhī hoti does not seize a nimitta,  
    n·ānubyañjana·ggāhī does not seize a detail). Is this just the first and secondary attitude that you take?

    It's most certainly not a "detail or characteristic", which carries the view that it's some aspect of the *sensory representation* of the object that you need to restrain yourself from seizing (e.g., pretend you're just seeing an abstract, unspecific shape while you look at another person). That's acting as if it's up to you what significances come with sensory perceptions, ironically taking ownership of the entire thing.

    Those *nimittas* would also be attitudes, but the thing is that the "attitudes" are technically more in the objects than they are in your mind. For example, both the sign of attractive (*subhanimitta)* based on which lust increases, and the sign of unattractive (*asubhanimitta*) that causes lust to decrease, are "available" in the object you perceive. Thus it is said that you should not grasp at those signs which would arouse lust or aversion.

    But I prefer to talk about it as an "attitude" rather than a "characteristic" of the object, because people are already too likely too misinterpret the latter. You could also say that it's a "context"; every object in and of itself has various contexts that can be adopted towards it—ways in which it can be *regarded*, as opposed to gimmicky ways of playing around with your perceptions which is what people would understand as "not grasping details and characteristics".

    >“Whatever ascetics and brahmins at present regard that in the world with a pleasant and agreeable nature as **permanent, as happiness, as self, as healthy, as secure**: they are nurturing craving.

    >\[...\]

    >“Whatever ascetics and brahmins at present regard that in the world with a pleasant and agreeable nature as i**mpermanent, as suffering, as nonself, as a disease, as fearful**: they are abandoning craving

    —SN 12.66

    These are all different *nimittas* that one could emphasize, the former being those which need to be avoided in the practice of sense restraint.

    >Do you think that *taṁ nimittaṁ* here refers to a different *nimitta* than *cittassa nimittaṁ*?

    They're the same essentially. In the first occurrence of *nimittaṃ uggaṇhāti*, it's about recognizing the sign of the fact that the defilements, when the *satipaṭṭhānas* are practiced with *this* attitude, are abandoned. You would only be able to know that if you can see the sign of the mind, because only then would you have the criterion to know whether it's defiled or not in the first place (which is why stream entry is the indispensable prerequisite for right meditation). And the other way around too: you would only know the mind indirectly by understanding that there is *something* there that doesn't directly appear, and which is indirectly affected by the attitude you undertake toward things. So if one can grasp any sign pertaining to the mind, one can grasp all of them; they're just different aspects of the same recognition that can be individually emphasized.

    This is mirrored by how if one sees any Noble Truth, [one sees all the others](https://suttacentral.net/sn56.30/en/sujato?lang=en) (conversely, if one doesn't see one, it's because one doesn't actually see the other three). Each truth pertains to one aspect of the same sign of the mind.

    In the context of this Sutta, the monk who cannot grasp the sign of his own mind is unable to recognize the problem, its origin, its cessation, and the way leading to its cessation all at the same time. So he would not recognize that his attempt to practice the 4 satipaṭṭhānas is itself underlain by the same craving he's trying to abandon, and he would simultaneously not know that *that's* what the problem is. He would be thinking that the problem is in the *content* of his application of the four satipaṭṭhānas, that maybe he should be using this object instead of that object, that he should be breathing like this and not like that, etc. And ironically many people would think that this is what it's about; knowing which object to use, how, and at what times so that the *symptoms* of craving are replaced with pleasure, thereby covering it up.

    >Different defilements need different "antidotes". For anger it is metta, for lust it is asubha. etc. If one doesn't know one's state of mind and its problems, then of course one cannot abandon the arisen defliment. If one doesn't know the obstrution, then one will not know the correct way out.

    Not really. The view you're alluding to is what we call *management* as opposed to *uprooting* of defilements. What this Sutta is referring to is way more subtle than just knowing which "antidote" you should be applying at what time. It would be, for instance, not recognizing how the impulse to apply an "antidote" is itself rooted in craving against displeasure, and how that antidote is being applied to the symptoms rather than root of the illness. All such practice provides is an immediate relief from the feeling caused by the underlying craving—not by *abandoning* that craving at its root, but by invoking a different feeling: a more pleasant one in the case of mettā to counter the displeasure, and a more unpleasant one in the case of asubha to counter the pleasure. The craving thus stops making noticeable "noise" even though it still lies latent there. Not seeing the signs of the mind, one would not also overlook the fact that that's what's actually going on.

    >Mind cannot arise without an object. It ALWAYS has an object. It can be sight, sound, smell, taste, touch, mental idea... If one cannot grasp that, then there is no mind.

    True, but that's not what I meant. I was referring to the potential misconception that the *nimitta* that one "grasps" could be some sort of direct representation of the mind, whereas the mind is always that which is at the background of objects, and *nimittas* in themselves are always indirect. They are not "images" of things, but *signs* of things, including of mental phenomena.

    >Why can't one do it in a busy mall but has to go into seclusion if one shouldn't try to replace one object with another? By going into seclusion one does replace one object (seeing people at the mall) with seeing wall of a cave, or trees .

    Yes, that's exactly what most people would think seclusion is for: running away from the disturbances. But seclusion is for the sake of *facing* the disturbances clearly on the mental level, not for appreciating the peaceful atmosphere and the chirping of the birds for its own sake.

    When you go into seclusion, unless you're are an anagāmi, or you're actively trying to ignore things by focusing on an object, your mind will naturally start coming up with thoughts and memories about things that it wants, such as the pleasure of being at a busy mall, faced with stimulating sense experiences. Instead of trying to think about something else so as to superficially calm the mind down, you would, *while* the mind still has those intentions, contemplate the danger of craving for pleasure so that dispassion becomes established in regard to the *same thing*, no so that the mind *forgets* about what was tempting it.

    You can't do that as well as you could in seclusion *while* you're in the busy mall, because it's not the same to experience things with your 5 senses as it is to contemplate them mentally.

    Either way, it's not that one should *never* "change the object", but that changing the object does nothing to fix the problem. So sure, you can forcefully stop thinking about things when the mind is too overwhelmed so that you don't proliferate the defilements further. But that's more like withdrawing from a fight that you're not ready for than a victory, so the less you need to do it the better. What one shouldn't do is think that meditation is about just doing that repeatedly until  some sort of bliss born of oblivion is reached. 

    If you stop practicing like that completely for a good month or two, the mind would be back to square 1.

    >Craving for jhana/arupa states (rūparāgo & arūparāgo), Ignorance (avijjā) and few other fetters are abandoned at Arhatship. For most people it is quite a long way away thus making it (craving for management ) irrelevant **until** lower factors are abandoned first. One can't abandon higher fetters until one abandons LOWER factors first. Fetter of Ignorance (and other higher fetters) are still present. So I think it is wrong to demand an Arahatta-magga level practice until one is actually close to it. Right?

    The (actual) jhānas can only be attained precisely by abandoning management. That is why they lead to Arahantship instead of *away* from it. Management can never magically result in uprooting, any more than running away from fights can make you a better fighter.

    > A child who goes into 1st grade (or even much higher grades, ex 5th-6th) isn't expected to behave like grade 12 student.

    So it's more like, someone who practices management is attending the wrong school altogether. Wherever they end up won't be Arahantship, because their practice is literally about *ignoring* the Four Noble Truths, and pretending like *feelings* are what suffering is.

    >Maybe for someone really shitty at meditation or just starting out. Anyone who has gained any modest skill in working with their mind learns to alter the troublesome relationship to thoughts and sensations itself as well, not just cover them up or swap out their objects.

    From the ultimate point of view that we're talking about, that "altering of the troublesome relationship" you refer to, if it's done through a meditation technique, is very much still a cover up. And the problem is not so much that it *is* a cover up, as almost everything an ordinary person does already is that, but that the cover up of meditation techniques tends to carry the view that it ***isn't*** in fact a cover up, so it's infinitely more detrimental.

    >Always resorting to caricatures and low-hanging fruit. For example, mockingly characterizing a method as “focusing on one’s nostrils” when a sensible person knows this is a failure mode, not the instruction itself.

    So sure, we "caricaturize" it often because otherwise we'd have to spend a long time going through the myriad different permutations and subtler ways in which the same principle manifests, but ultimately the principle that makes "focusing on one's nostrils" wrong is an underlying tendency of the mind that would extend to the attempt to apply *our own instructions*, let alone other contemporary techniques that are more nuanced than pure nostril-watching. For instance, even the most "open awareness" type of approach is still wrong because it would still involve the same attitude as focusing, even though they're starkly different on the surface.

    You could say that that tendency is necessarily there until a person attains stream entry, which is why it's so important for them not to think that they're already meditating properly: *managing* their feelings instead of uprooting their *craving*.

    >How can one ATTEND to something that is NOT an object? The fact that the bhikkhu in question is said to be "attending to some sign" implies that the thing attended to is an object of attention. "Grasping" has quite different (indirect) connotations than "attending", so it seems difficult to say that the nimitta mentioned here is the same as the one in the Cook's Simile.

    Well, of course there is nothing that can be designated that is outside the sphere of the six senses. But still, signs are always on a different level than the objects they signify. That's what they're *defined by:* the structural fact of pointing toward, characterizing or indicating something ***while*** being separate from it (and this definition applies to all the occurences of "nimitta" in the Suttas, including mundane ones, like the "pubbanimitta" for Brahma's appearance in DN 11 being a light that appears.

    Therefore, when you *attend* to a sign, meaning when you take it as an object in its own right, it ceases to be a sign and becomes the main object which has its own signs. That's the basic principle of how the mind works.

    >How can one attend to their own attitude - nimitta, as you put it?

    So it is a form of "attention" (*manasikāra)* from a third person point of view. It can't be anything else because all dhammas originate from attention as the Buddha said. But for your *personal* point of view, while things are being concretely experienced, a nimitta will always be there *in regard to* what you're attending to.

    And as I mentioned in another comment somewhere here, "attitude" is not a literal translation of nimitta. Attitudes are only one kind of nimitta, but it's one of the most practical forms of them. I don't think there's a word that would translate it literally while also giving you any sort of palpable sense of what it means.

    For example, the asubhanimitta is not strictly an "attitude", it is a characteristic of the *thing* that is already implicit in it (AN 6.41). But if I say that you need to find the asubha in the *object*, people will interpret it as if the asubha is in some visual perception (even imaginary) that they can directly apprehend, which is emphatically not the case (otherwise there wouldn't have been those Vinaya stories of monks engaging in intercourse with the wounds of decomposed corpses). So thinking in terms of the attitude towards the object, which strictly speaking also belongs to the object/aggregates in the final analysis, is a more useful pointer.

    >the sutta literally says that bhikkhu is giving attention to something is what makes it sound like "nimitta" is being used in reference to a palpable object of some sort.

    Besides, one has to keep in mind that the word "give attention" in English has connotations that the phrase "\[nimittaṃ\] manasi karoti" in Pāli doesn't. The latter literally just means "to make into the mind".

    >If the replacement is a replacement of one "attitude" with another, this would then just be replacing one fine peg with another fine peg ... what exactly would be "coarser" about the first attitude in that case? Just the fact that it is unwholesome?

    When the mind is taken by unwholesome thoughts, one is not even *aware* of the attitude that is present. From one's point of view, it's more like one is *absorbed* in whatever one is thinking about, and this is the "coarse peg". Thus, the shift of nimitta will always be experienced more as if you *introduced* something more subtle into the experience that wasn't there before (a peripheral attitude). The wrong attitudes cannot be there *while* one is aware of having them; they are there precisely to the extent they are not seen for what they are.

    If, on the other hand, you simply attend to something else altogether, there is no sense of introducing something more subtle. It's more like you just replaced an apple with an orange.

    (Edit: Also, it might be helpful to take into account the description at the end of MN 28, which squarely refutes the common idea that you can possibly have just one "object" present in your experience. Every single "object" that is cognized by a sense base is itself composed of the five aggregates, and included within that would be your attitudes, intentions and inclinations towards that object. That's why you can change those while the "object" as a whole remains the same.)

    >You allude to it being a matter of applying ones’s own instructions, but what does that mean? Enduring the pressure on the right level once it is elicited by renunciation/sense-restraint is an instruction of sorts too.. so what, though?

    What I meant is that even religiously adhering to HH instructions would not ensure that one isn't operating under the principle of management. As in, a person could be fully sold on the idea that the practice is about "enduring things on the right level and uprooting things instead of managing them", and *still* be managing things while explicitly telling themselves that they're not doing so, and being dead sure about it.

    That's because that "principle" I'm referring to is not something that a person can simply stop doing; it's something that underlies their entire existence—it *is* existence in fact (bhava). It's the (unseen) attitude of seeking an escape from *dukkha* by substituting or manipulating the feeling that's causing it rather than being unmoved by that feeling, which would be the true uprooting of craving.

    A person will usually not outright say to themselves that they're trying to get rid of their feelings; they'll always *think* that it's the craving that they're abandoning. They'd fall into that if they started their practice with the pernicious assumption that they already know what craving is, whereas the practice should've from the very start been about abandoning their wrong assumptions about what craving is, which is what eventually results in sotāpatti. Engaging in any form of meditation without abandoning those wrong assumptions first necessarily entails doing that meditation *with them,* and with craving by extension.

    That's how profoundly ingrained these tendencies are, and that's why there is no right meditation (actual abandonment of craving) without the Right View.

    >I also somewhat disagree with framing open awareness as involving focus.

    That's not what I meant. I said they involve the same *attitude* as any focusing practice, i.e. the attitude of management. Of course they are the opposite of focusing, and the point is that even that doesn't make them better by any significant margin.

    >continually relaxing any tendency of the mind to fixate on particulars, but still maintaining metacognitive awareness and alert presence.

    But why would someone feel a need to do that? The answer is: it covers up whatever displeasure they were experiencing. The right practice, available only once a person becomes a sotāpanna, would be such that you don't suffer without having to "relax" or "do" anything regarding the feeling that arose. The different "methods" the Buddha taught, like the four satipaṭṭhānas and anapanasati, are just different angles from which to approach that "non-doing" in regard to whatever arises, no matter how unpleasant and threatening.

    > It might not be fully *sufficient*, but neither is cardio and weightlifting for a boxer and no one regards that as a misguided covering up of their actual task.

    That's not an accurate analogy because these practices don't prepare you to abandon craving at all. "Success" in them happens precisely when you get what you craved for—when you get rid of what was bothering you—regardless of whether it's by "relaxing", by contemplating, by focusing, by "just being", or by anything whatsoever (including "enduring things on the right level") that a puthujjana might feel "works" for them without immediately turning them into a sotāpanna. If it doesn't, it's still a cover up on some level.

    The "cardio and weightlifting" of a Dhamma practitioner would be virtue and sense restraint, if anything.

    So, just to be clear, the issue I'm describing is not solved by doing what we say instead of what all other teachers say. It's solved by acknowledging that for as long as one remains a puthujjana, the work is to *find out* what the practice is, not *do* the practice. As we say often, a person will need to question their attitudes and motivations behind even virtue and sense restraint. Even that you cannot "just do", because until the person abandons *sīlabbataparāmāsa,* that will also be a form of management. The difference being it doesn't in itself bring wrong views and delusion to increase, unlike meditation techniques.

    >Is that roughly correct?

    Yes, theoretically, as long as it's interpreted in a simultaneous and structrual sense instead of a temporal, sequential one. Although, again, it doesn't hurt to emphasize that the most important point is not that people should simply replace whatever "model" they have with this one. It's that they need to come to terms with the fact that the practice and the correct implementation of whatever the right model is starts with sotāpatti, not before.

    If people take every single HH teaching as gospel and reject everything else, but continue to relate to the Dhamma as if they have a good sense of what they're doing and how it's leading them to liberation, that wouldn't be much of an improvement (e.g., they rashly assume that they're already capable of doing away with the fourth layer of the model, which will automatically mean that they're still operating on levels 2 and 3).

    One must instead take the attitude of someone who's trying to find their way out of a vast maze with only a couple of very rough pointers. Being perpetually ready to accept that what seems like the right direction to go (what seems like it's removing the 4th layer) might very well not be, because you genuinely have no way to tell except in hindsight, *once* you're out of the maze alive (i.e., once you know beyond doubt that you're free from wrong view).

    If a sensible, self-transparent person were to approach the Dhamma with that attitude, paired with virtue and sense restraint, they might be able to make it out of the maze without detailed instruction such as this "model" we're discussing (and the rest of the "jargon laden dhamma/existentialism fusion" as you put it).

    >And that, furthermore, people often think they’re operating on the level of 4 while they’re actually still subtly performing 2 & 3 moves by trying to modify feelings instead of directly uprooting them at their source via the gradual training as an overcoming of the valuing of sensuality; e.g., they might tell themselves that they’re equanimously observing an unpleasant sensation/emotion with detachment, but they’re actually doing so with an unacknowledged underlying attitude of hoping that this will eventually remove or lessen the unpleasant sensation/emotion?

    That's right. But, to go further, they might even genuinely succeed in lessening the unpleasant emotion. People clearly often do, otherwise management techniques wouldn't be so popular—*they work*. The problem is that this type of success still depends on the principle of *action*, no matter how infinitesimally small, and it's a universal law that no action can with 100% certainty produce the desired result. Hence, it's not the Dhamma, because it's categorically impossible for the Dhamma to fail. The Dhamma is the *cessation* of action, not action that *provides* freedom from suffering (a contradiction in terms; action ***is*** suffering). It's the inviolable nature of things that if there is no craving, no suffering can be there, regardless of what you do or don't do.

    Uprooting, in contrast with management, "works" such that you don't have to do anything whatsoever or obtain any result in order to be free. Neither before things manifest, nor while, nor after, with no exceptions. That is the stilling of all *saṅkhāras* and the relinquishment of all appropriation which the Suttas describe as Nibbāna—it's not a mystical state of consciousness resulting from meditation.

    And that is what needs to be understood to *become* a sotāpanna; it's not that only an Arahant has access to that.

    (Since people often get confused, it's worth pointing out that jhānas and samādhi also partake in the same principle of cessation and uprooting, and are reached through abandoning all dependence on management. It's not like they're the "right management" that magically leads one to the ending of management.)

    >“Reverend, they say that ‘extinguishment is apparent in the present life’. In what way did the Buddha say extinguishment is apparent in the present life?”

    >“Here, a bhikkhu, separated from sensuality ... dwells in the first jhāna having entered it. To this extent the Buddha said that extinguishment is apparent in the present life in a qualified sense. …

    >“Thus, friends, you should train yourselves: ‘Being monks devoted to Dhamma, we will speak in praise of jhana monks.’ That’s how you should train yourselves. Why is that? Because these are amazing people, hard to find in the world, i.e., those who dwell touching ***the deathless element*** with the body.

    AN 6.46

    (Edit: Also, regarding the model you presented, emotions/feelings [actually precede perception *structurally*](https://suttacentral.net/mn18/en/sujato). It's a common error of modern thought to assume that "the facts" are primary and feelings secondary).

    I see where you're going, but not quite. nimittas are the signs through which you recognize/relate to *one thing*, so it's not the same as the dependence of one thing upon another as in PS.

    You would know what feeling, craving, and contact are by grasping their nimittas, and on the basis of that their dependence would become clear. 

    By not grasping their nimittas, what a person would think craving is, actually isn't, for example. Any alleged recognition of "with feeling, craving is" would thus also be missing the mark. 

    That's what ignorance is, in a nutshell:  because of the lack of knowledge of the *signs* of an orange, one would think something is an orange when it's actually a mandarine, or think it's a mandarine when it's actually an orange. avijjā works exactly the same way (not knowing the *signs* of wholesome and unwholesome, for instance).

    >But when I ask myself to what end one would do that, it is for the same ending of suffering/dissatisfaction (dukkha →dukkha-nirodha) that the whole dhamma undertaking is always about, right? How then does this escape the "manipulation of feelings" accusation you level against the other contemporary approaches?

    The need to manipulate one's feelings does constitute another layer of feeling, which is the second arrow.

    But a puthujjana must think in terms of giving up *all* need to manipulate his feelings, not of finding the second layer and abolishing it, because whatever he thinks that second layer is will necessarily be within the first—that's exactly what makes him a puthujjana. So no matter how far he steps back in his experience, even if he goes back to some hypothetical layer 16 within the structure we discussed, he will still just be dealing with the first arrow.

    So it differs from contemporary approaches most crucially in that those would not be giving you that disclaimer, allowing you to proceed with your limited understanding of what suffering is and "just practice". They don't force you to challenge your conceptions about what actually needs to be fixed; they just give you different tools to pick and choose from. If they then go even further in telling you absurd things like that focusing on breathing sensations until you enter a trance is the way out of suffering, that's just the cherry on the cake, not the cake itself.

    >Is it simply because it is actually effective and the other way is not?

    Ultimately yes, but practically no. The other way can seem totally effective because people already don't recognize their *liability* to suffering on the broadest level; all they recognize is particular sufferings, even if it's the aggregation of all the sufferings they know. This results in them being free from (internal) things that *try* to make them suffer, while the liability to suffering is destroyed when *despite* your aggregates trying to make you suffer, you can't. Only that counts as success from a truly Buddhist standard, because the former can be achieved for a while by any random person who goes on vacation and/or takes drugs—awfully effective for many—whereas the latter is something that nobody in the world except the noble ones can even fathom.

    >HH talks in terms of being "unmoved" in relation to craving and aversion, but unmoved cannot just be non-acting, but an actually alleviation of the suffering associated with it, so this seems like a second-order craving of sorts? Do you view the yoniso manasikara resulting in non-appropriation and non-ownership of the feelings as a way out of this?

    So yes, that's correct. But a puthujjana would only see for himself what is that associated suffering that gets alleviated (the suffering of *kamma* that I alluded to earlier) by enduring whatever for him *seems* to be the suffering without acting out of it. That endurance is what yoniso manasikāra is.

    Yes. And it's not even that you need to deliberately *attend* to the sign of craving for comfort or against discomfort. It's the default attitude.

    So effort needs to be made to attend to and clarify signs like the danger of *this intention* of seeking pleasure  and avoiding displeasure that is there, and how giving in to that makes you more affected by displeasure when it inevitably comes.

    >while endurance is just feelings urges of wanting and not wanting but not performing the associated behaviors that would satisfy them.

    This is exactly what yoniso manasikāra achieves. If you don't have that underlying context then you cannot "endure" things properly. Your endurance would still be a form of engagement and investment in them.

    Only when your mind is simultaneously established on something more primordial than the pressure—such as, yes, the body, but apprehended as a background foundation to your experience and not as a foreground sense perception—can you transcend the two  opposing ends of indulging and denying. Those two opposing things both "satisfy" the pressure.

    >For instance, if we see the danger in the slightest fault, we should, at all times, try to avoid scratching our body because of an itching sensation, and other similar almost automatized reactions to body and mind commands. Right?

    If you take such things to be unwholesome then you will certainly become unnecessarily neurotic and wound up. "Danger in the slightest fault" refers only to the actions pertaining to the 8 precepts, and the 4 forms of wrong speech.

    You basically don't need to be at all concerned about what bodily actions you do unless it falls within those (even a little bit, hence "slightest fault") or within unmistakable indulgence and ill will.

    >In case of doubt, since most of us don't have available a proper teacher to ask to, it is better to "over do it" than to fall short (specially in the beginning)?

    It's certainly critical to dedicate time to straightening out one's views in the beginning, since almost all of us today start out extremely amiss. But it should not be done at the expense of the actual training in restraint, and there will come a point where one has all the "ideas" down well enough, after which the lack of practical application will become the true limiting factor.

    In this context, as a *prerequisite* for going in to solitude, it would simply mean that one should have reached the point where breaking the 8 precepts takes more effort than keeping them.

    Solitude and seeing the signs of the mind on the basis of that would eventually result in the ["accomplishment in virtue"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLRRaga5a2s), which is the Right View (the ability to be virtuous without *sīlabbataparamāsa).*

### Do you think going forth is the best possible way to train the mind?

Hello, I was wondering about one point and since I have no experience in the matter, I'm curious what people that possibly have some experience might think about it.

&#x200B;

Do you think going forth and ordaining is the best way to put all the odds in your favor when it comes to train to become a sotapanna or anagami?

&#x200B;

The reason I'm wondering is that I realized that in my daily living I encounter plenty of agreeable and disagreeable sense-objects in the society on which I have no control and that can allow me to endure the discomfort from the pressure and not delight in the perspective of getting rid of it.

I'm bombarded with pressurable things, the mind is pushed left and right, while on the other hand, I imagine the life of a bhikkhu (but I might be wrong, after all I don't know what's it is like at all) to be less stressful on the level of encountering all these sense-objects, being surrounded by people wanting to live peacefully, also people that are more likely to be easy to live with because more restrained that those we can encounter in the world, and so all-in-all possibly being a less pressuring context, or maybe at least pressuring at first because of not getting used to so much austerity, but once one get used to it I feel like it could be possible to fall into a sort of "complacency" by not being pressured enough to be able to train the mind.

&#x200B;

I'm not saying that to criticize, I'm genuinely curious about it.

I read the story from someone who got into a one-year thailand retreat and was not doing much during all that year, he admitted not being asked much by others because he was a foreigner (??) but I believe that even if he was doing some tasks the result would have been similar.

He said his mind got peaceful by being extremely secluded from all the pressuring things of the world, but that as soon as he had to come back into the world for administrative purposes and having to confront the effervescence of the world, people being in hurry, not being considerate, the peace disappeared.

So I understand it as if his mind wasn't trained enough to be immovable by the pressure of disagreeable things in the world.

&#x200B;

What do you think?

    >He said his mind got peaceful by being extremely secluded from all the pressuring things of the world, but that as soon as he had to come back into the world for administrative purposes and having to confront the effervescence of the world, people being in hurry, not being considerate, the peace disappeared.

    Yes, this is the only peace that the vast majority of people who ordain get to experience, and it's mainly because of their wrong views of what the practice is about.

    Monastic life is, or at least was meant to be, where one can *begin* to confront the things of the world in their entirety, because it's only when you're not engaging with them that you get to see them in their fullness. That probably sounds absurd to someone who is immersed in the world, but it's when your engagements have been minimized in the way prescribed by the Vinaya that you start to come face to face with "pressuring things".  The full extent of pressure can only be experienced when there are no "outlets" for it in terms of bodily and verbal action, and blocking  those outlets is what monastic discipline is about.

    Not having those fixed constraints, counterintuitively, allows even a layperson who keeps the 8 precepts to let off some of the steam of their restraint without realizing it, and this is why not going forth is a compromise.

    Since people, when they take on the robe, think of virtue as only a set of observances that only need to be externally kept, and are basically just imitating the standards of whatever tradition they joined, they never force themselves to take on virtue "on the right level" as we say, meaning that, indeed, at some point things become peaceful and it seems like there is nothing further to do on that front, because the initial difficulty (if there was any) of the mere external adherence to the rules has faded.

    At that point, the natural assumption for most monastics is that the further "development" that's needed is in the meditation technique department, which will cement them even more in the wrong type of peace that comes from circumstantially avoiding disturbances.

    But beneath all that superficial peace, the *value* of the things of the world remains untouched. The work of wearing away that value is what would force one to confront those things that one only externally relinquished. A layperson is in a much less advantageous position to *question* that value to begin with because they still to some extent carry it forth through their very livelihood, even, again, if they keep the 8 precepts.

    The internal valuing of the world that remains is measured by whether or not a monastic *could* still disrobe, and to what extent, having done so, they would return to the same things that they previously relinquished. If they do so, it means that they were abstaining from those things only because their external *duty* of being in robes, which they no longer see a purpose for, obliged them to. They never took advantage of the external restraint to become internally and  irreversibly dispassionate towards the world.

    There is no inherent problem in [meditating with sensuality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_BeJMNM86A) from a worldly point of view. In an isolated analysis, it is better than coarser forms of sensuality such as anything that involves breaking the five precepts ***if*** it is being done at the expense of those more unwholesome things. If a person totally replaces those things with their "meditation" of choice, it will probably lead to a better rebirth at least. (But even that is quite an achievement; most people do their "meditation" on the side of their coarse sensual engagements. They don't even replace one with the other).

    However, when it does becomes a net negative by far rather than a net positive is when people start thinking that by engaging in such meditation, they are on some level partaking in the Buddha's teaching, and when they start using Buddhist terminology such as jhānas, wisdom, Four Noble Truths, etc., to talk about the experiences that result from those practices. They then start to not only delude themselves, but also others who might've strived for and achieved *actual* freedom from suffering rather than this bogus version of it that's available for much cheaper.

    If a person's goals are limited to the 4 things you listed, then potentially they can achieve that though doing what almost any "Buddhist" teacher today would instruct them to do. But ideally, if they insist in practicing like that, they better do so with the knowledge that that's not *actually* the Buddha's teaching, and that the true purification from defilements comes at a higher price than they're currently willing to pay.

    If they want to achieve *freedom from suffering* in the Buddha's definition, however, then seeing any value in meditating with sensuality will become a categorical obstacle. It will prevent them from ever finding out what sensuality actually is, as they think they're already abandoning it by getting these counterfeit "jhānas", and yet they're not even scratching the surface.

### Ajahn Chah's approach to mediation

In this talk Ajahn Chah talks about using meditation to calm the mind to then give rise to mindfulness.

>We take note of these three points \[nose-tip, chest, abdomen\] in order to make the mind firm, to limit mental activity so that mindfulness and self-awareness can easily arise.

Is this approach also valid? Or is it that any progress with the meditation approach as apposed to the wisdom approach (as the talk goes on to mention) is only due the work of changing your actions based on awareness of intentions which is now more discernable due to the meditation.

[https://www.ajahnchah.org/book/On\_Meditation1.php](https://www.ajahnchah.org/book/On_Meditation1.php)

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1akcirs/ajahn_chahs_approach_to_mediation/kpbe6qe/)** _2024-02-07 11:14:41:

    The gist of it is that Ajahn Chah seems to not have had a sharp sense of what exactly obstructs the majority of people from reaching what he (most likely) did attain, and to not have had a very technical knowledge of the Suttas. What he describes in the context of meditation is how things would unfold for a mind that has already been trained and withdrawn from the things that actually obstruct calmness (sensuality and aversion): by that point you can genuinely just *choose* to "let go" of your thoughts and only contemplate your breathing, for example, without it being unwholesome. That is what it means for the mind to be "pliable"; it seamlessly goes along with whatever you tell it to do.

    But it is impossible for it the mind to be malleable like this for whomever has not first tamed it through renunciation and restraint, which, based on statements from his disciples, was the subject of the majority of his talks to the monks. Ajahn Chah giving a discourse on meditation practice was rare, but the ones he gave are obviously what has been given the most emphasis.

    For people whose minds are still pulled by sensuality, what attending to the breath and trying to "let go of preoccupations" will result in is a contrived attempt to *suppress* their thinking and mental movements, which means that they're trying to run away from things to be free from them. The exact same principle of sensuality and craving lies behind their endeavor of attaining samādhi, because that's the impetus that their minds still carry, maintained through nothing other their unrestrained actions: chasing pleasure and avoiding pain. 

    >“The Blessed One, brahmin, did not praise every type of meditation, nor did he condemn every type of meditation. What kind of meditation did the Blessed One not praise? Here, brahmin, someone abides with his mind overcome by sensual passion, a prey to sensual passion, and he does not understand as it is the escape from arisen sensual passion. ***While he harbours sensual lust internally***, he meditates, premeditates, out-meditates, and mismeditates. He abides with his mind overcome by ill will, a prey to ill will…with his mind overcome by sloth and torpor, a prey to sloth and torpor…with his mind overcome by restlessness and remorse, a prey to restlessness and remorse…with his mind overcome by doubt, a prey to doubt, and he does not understand as it is the escape from arisen doubt. ***While he harbours doubt internally,*** he meditates, premeditates, out-meditates, and mismeditates. The Blessed One did not praise that kind of meditation.

    —MN 108

    "Harboring internally" means that, due to not even understanding what the hindrances are and how they are abandoned, those hindrances remain at the back of one's mind no matter what one is meditating upon and experiencing. So due to not having actually dealt with the problem of sensuality beforehand, and trying to jump right away into watching their breath, sensuality is there whether the person realizes it or not—even if they are able to attain some (from their ordinary point of view) special blissful states. The hindrances are not particular thoughts that you can get rid of by attending to something else; they are the context with which you live your life and relate to your experience, including while you are watching your breath or what have you. That context cannot be removed by *doing* something directly; it is either fueled or starved indirectly through the choices you make by body, speech, and mind (AN 10.61).

     In MN 125, the Buddha states that the reason why a certain prince cannot comprehend what unification of mind (*ekaggatā*) is is because his mind is still bent on sensuality, not because he hasn't been focusing on his breath long or well enough.

    Likewise, for a person in a similar position, which is just about everyone today, any meditation they do and unification of mind they attain will be underlain by their sensual inclinations, evidenced by how they would perfectly be able to enjoy worldly pleasures on the side, whereas if they were truly attaining the right type of calm that Ajahn Chah is pointing to, those things would start to become repulsive and unthinkable to engage in.

    > “Bhikkhus, without giving up these six things, it is impossible to dwell in the first jhāna having entered it. What six? Desire for sensual pleasures, ill will, dullness and drowsiness, restlessness and remorse, and doubt. **And the danger in sensual pleasures hasn’t been seen as it is with right understanding.** Without giving up these six things, it is impossible to dwell in the first jhāna having entered it.

    —AN 6.73

    The stage that Ajahn Chah is describing, where you can slow your breath down and quiet your thoughts, etc., would come about in the right way only if you have *already* conquered the hindrances and can let go of them at will. That's the only way that your mind will genuinely stay settled upon something *on its own,* with little to no need for ***you*** to be trying to stop thinking, and therefore that meditation would not be rooted in suppression, aversion and not wanting to take responsibility for the wildness of your own mind, looking for an easy shortcut instead.

    Hence, his giving that sort of instruction to beginners was—as regards teaching skill, which is ultimately a mundane factor and doesn't in itself invalidate his understanding—a mistake. He was talking as if it would just be as simple for anyone as it was for him.

    In contrast, in AN 8.63 for example, the Buddha instructs the monk that he must get his mind to be stable and  unmoved by unwholesome states ***before*** he starts practicing the *brahmavihāras* and *jhānas*, not that he should practice those things *in order to* make his mind unmoved by unwholesome states, the topsy-turvy way in which people like to go about it, and which results in seeing anything but the true Dhamma.

    >“Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu who has five qualities can’t dwell having entered right composure. What five? It’s when a bhikkhu can’t endure sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and touches. A bhikkhu who has these five qualities can’t dwell in right composure having entered it."

    —AN 5.113

    If you can't endure the five senses *as they are* in your ordinary state of being without any sensuality or aversion arising whatsoever—if you are not already in total control of those five animals all the time—then whatever states of samādhi you get will be wrong.

    It's as if there were a room that you're responsible for keeping clean and tidy: any attempt to leave the room when it's still a mess will be inevitably rooted in an aversion to doing your duty. But if the room is nice and orderly and *then* you decide to go to another room, it would not be because you're running away from the mess. You have nothing to fear if you were to stay in the current room indefinitely.

    In the same way, you would only be able to start shedding away the coarse aspects of thinking *after* it has been fully purified from sensuality and unwholesome states and you're already burden-free *all the time*, without having to attend to your breath at all. If you try do it before that, it will inevitably be because you're chasing a separate (also sensual) pleasure that will temporarily absolve you from the very task that would actually free you from disturbances eventually.

    (P.S. The fact that Ajahn Chah's teaching skills might not have been the best is concretely evidenced by how the actual essence of his message seems to have gone over his disciple's heads; just by reading his *already tampered-with* recorded talks carefully, one realizes that his living disciples are perpetually misrepresenting him. Who knows how much greater the discrepancy would be if we would have access to his verbatim statements).

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1akcirs/ajahn_chahs_approach_to_mediation/kpbs7fq/)** _2024-02-07 13:24:21 *(in reply to a comment not included)*:

    >This meditation discourse also feels off in contrast to the numerous talks by Ajahn Chah where he emphasises the question "what are you resisting?" which is the main theme of sense restraint and renunciation.

    Yes, that's another thing worth noting. One has to contrast these instructions he gave with his underlying *view* of the Dhamma, which he emphasized much more frequently than these occasional mentions of nostrils, etc.

    On many occasions he would be correcting the people who showed up to him with the wrong attitudes toward meditation that are widespread today. It seems that he just wasn't too skilled in making sure that he wasn't misunderstood *in the first place* so that he didn't have to correct people later.

    See for example this section from "About Being Careful":

    >When we see the body in the body, which means we see the Dhamma in the body, knowing our own and others' bodies as impermanent phenomena, then we don't need detailed explanations. Sitting here, we have mindfulness constantly in control, knowing things as they are, and meditation then becomes quite simple. It's the same if we meditate on *Buddho* - **if we understand what Buddho really is, then we don't need to repeat the word 'Buddho.' It means having full knowledge and firm awareness. This is meditation.**

    >Still, meditation is generally not well understood. We practice in a group, but we often don't know what it's all about. Some people think meditation is really hard to do. ''I come to the monastery, but I can't sit. I don't have much endurance. My legs hurt, my back aches, I'm in pain all over.'' So they give up on it and don't come anymore, thinking they can't do it.

    >**But in fact** ***samādhi*** **is not sitting.** ***Samādhi*** **isn't walking. It isn't lying down or standing. Sitting, walking, closing the eyes, opening the eyes, these are all mere actions.** Having your eyes closed doesn't necessarily mean you're practicing *samādhi*. It could just mean that you're drowsy and dull. If you're sitting with your eyes closed but you're falling asleep, your head bobbing all over and your mouth hanging open, that's not sitting in *samādhi*. It's sitting with your eyes closed. ***Samādhi*** **and closed eyes are two separate matters. Real** ***samādhi*** **can be practiced with eyes open or eyes closed. You can be sitting, walking, standing or lying down.**

    >*Samādhi* means the mind is firmly focused, with all-encompassing mindfulness, restraint, and caution. You are constantly aware of right and wrong, constantly watching all conditions arising in the mind. **When it shoots off to think of something, having a mood of aversion or longing, you are aware of that.** Some people get discouraged: ''I just can't do it. As soon as I sit, my mind starts thinking of home. That's evil (Thai: *bahp*).'' Hey! If just that much is evil, the Buddha never would have become Buddha. He spent five years struggling with his mind, thinking of his home and his family. It was only after six years that he awakened.

    >Some people feel that these sudden arisings of thought are wrong or evil. You may have an impulse to kill someone. But you are aware of it in the next instant, you realize that killing is wrong, so you stop and refrain. Is there harm in this? What do you think? Or if you have a thought about stealing something and that is followed by a stronger recollection that to do so is wrong, and so you refrain from acting on it - is that bad kamma? It's not that every time you have an impulse you instantly accumulate bad kamma. Otherwise, how could there be any way to liberation? Impulses are merely impulses. **Thoughts are merely thoughts. In the first instance, you haven't created anything yet. In the second instance, if you act on it with body, speech or mind, then you are creating something.** *Avijjā* (ignorance) has taken control. If you have the impulse to steal and then you are aware of yourself and aware that this would be wrong, this is wisdom, and there is *vijjā* (knowledge) instead. The mental impulse is not consummated.

    >This is timely awareness, of wisdom arising and informing our experience. If there is the first mind-moment of wanting to steal something and then we act on it, that is the dhamma of delusion; the actions of body, speech and mind that follow the impulse will bring negative results.

    >**This is how it is. Merely having the thoughts is not negative kamma. If we don't have any thoughts, how will wisdom develop? Some people simply want to sit with a blank mind. That's wrong understanding.**

    Some other excerpts from "Still, Flowing Water";

    >•Some people think that meditation means to sit in some special way, but in actual fact standing, sitting, walking and reclining are all vehicles for meditation practice. You can practice at all times. Samādhi literally means ''the firmly established mind.'' **To develop samādhi you don't have to go bottling the mind up. Some people try to get peaceful by sitting quietly and having nothing disturb them at all, but that's just like being dead. The practice of samādhi is for developing wisdom and understanding.**

    >•Samādhi is the firm mind, the one-pointed mind. On which point is it fixed? **It's fixed onto the point of balance. That's its point.** But people practice meditation by trying to silence their minds. They say, ''I try to sit in meditation but my mind won't be still for a minute. One instant it flies off one place, the next instant it flies off somewhere else... How can I make it stop still?'' **You don't have to make it stop, that's not the point. Where there is movement is where understanding can arise. People complain, ''It runs off and I pull it back again; then it goes off again and I pull it back once more...'' So they just sit there pulling back and forth like this.**

    >•Meditating to find peace... You must understand what peace is. **If you don't understand it you won't be able to find it.**

    >•We speak of wisdom (paññā) and samādhi as separate things, but in essence they are one and the same. Wisdom is the dynamic function of samādhi; samādhi is the passive aspect of wisdom. [...] In our practice it isn't necessary to talk of samatha (concentration) or vipassanā (insight), just call it the practice of Dhamma, that's enough. 

    >•Therefore it is said to begin the practice by calming the mind. Put awareness into the mind. If the mind is aware it will be at peace. **Some people don't go for awareness, they just want to have peace, a kind of blanking out.** So they never learn anything. I

    >•The right way to train the mind is to make it bright, to develop wisdom. Don't think that training the mind is simply sitting quietly. That's the rock covering the grass. **People get drunk over it. They think that samādhi is sitting.** 

    >•We have to know when the mind is thinking good and bad, changing all the time, we have to know these things. If we understand this point, **then even while we are thinking we can be at peace.**

    >•Some [feelings] are pleasant, some are unpleasant, but that's not important. That's just their business. Just like the monkey, all monkeys are the same. We understand [feelings] as sometimes agreeable, sometimes not - that's just their nature. We should understand them and know how to let them go. [Feelings] are uncertain. They are transient, imperfect and ownerless. Everything that we perceive is like this. When eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body and mind receive [feelings], we know them, just like knowing the monkey. Then we can be at peace.

    >•For the really earnest student, the more [feelings] the better. But many meditators shrink away from [feelings], they don't want to deal with them. This is like the naughty schoolboy who won't go to school, won't listen to the teacher. These [feelings] are teaching us. When we know [feelings] then we are practicing Dhamma. The peace within [feelings] is just like understanding the monkey here. When you understand what monkeys are like you are no longer troubled by them.

    >**You must know [feelings]before you can let them go. When you see that [feelings] are impermanent you will be untroubled by them.**

    Most people who would just jump into his instructions on watching the breath carrying all these views that he himself is denouncing.

    To pick an example for the sake of contrast, Ajahn Maha Boowa genuinely seems to have been giving his students this array of clear-cut techniques that they should just mindlessly grind away it,  without all these nuanced recognitions of what is truly wholesome and unwholesome, warning of the subtle pitfalls on the level of underlying views and notions, etc. 

    His teaching is in the spirit that the Dhamma is a *result* of meditation (in the sense of a mechanical performance of mental drills), whereas it is evident if one inspects carefully that for Ajahn Chah the Dhamma/Right View comes first, and meditation can only be right if it's founded upon that.
- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1akcirs/ajahn_chahs_approach_to_mediation/kphmwjq/)** _2024-02-08 14:47:09 *(in reply to a comment not included)*:

    Every single time the Buddha mentioned the word "sati", he was talking about peripheral awareness.

    Sati means recollection/memory, and the nature of every memory, even ordinarily, is that it's peripheral to whatever it's bound with. We can never *choose* to have a memory of something. If we could, we would never forget things. We can only start attending to a memory directly (at which point it will become the foreground, carrying its own individual memories) if it was given there peripherally with what we were attending to initially.

    The practice of focusing on objects which is what people take to be "sati" is therefore something else altogether. Context/memory/sati is not even what they're practicing; there is always a context enduring *peripherally* to the focusing, and that context is always necessarily wrong. And they're not aware of it because their whole aim is to turn the mind away from everything except what they're focusing on.

    This is what passages like the following succinctly convey:

    >“Meditate like a thoroughbred, Sandha, not like a wild colt. And how does a wild colt meditate? When a wild colt is tied up near the feeding trough he meditates: ‘Fodder, fodder!’ For what reason? Because when a wild colt is tied up by the feeding trough, **he does not ask himself: ‘Now what task will my trainer set for me today? What can I do to satisfy him?’ Tied up by the feeding trough, he just meditates: ‘Fodder, fodder!’**

    >So too, Sandha, a person who is like a wild colt, when gone to the forest, to the foot of a tree, or to an empty hut, dwells with a mind obsessed and oppressed by sensual lust, and he does not understand as it really is the escape from arisen sensual lust. Harboring sensual lust **internally** \[i.e., **with a peripheral context of sensuality that he overlooks by focusing on the foreground**\], he meditates, premeditates, out-meditates, and mismeditates. He dwells with a mind obsessed and oppressed by ill will … by dullness and drowsiness … by restlessness and remorse … by doubt, and he does not understand as it really is the escape from arisen doubt. Harboring doubt internally, he meditates, premeditates, out-meditates, and mismeditates.

### 22.95. A Lump of Foam

Would  love to get @bhikkhu_anigha interpretation of the Phenapindupama
sutta. From a pair of eyes with little dust🙏🙏.

https://suttacentral.net/sn22.95/en/bodhi?lang=en&reference=none&highlight=false

I always like to keep a sutta in my mind throughout my day and night, constantly reminding me to keep on track. M.n. 10 udana Bhiya sutta is one of them. The other is this Phenapindupama sutta. 


- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1ak3hu9/2295_a_lump_of_foam/kp6j5e4/)** _2024-02-06 14:31:40:

    Things being "hollow, void, and insubstantial" does not mean that your *experience* of them is somehow "illusory" and that you need to uncover a hidden "reality" instead. This would be wrong because it would imply what your new way of experiencing things, that "reality" you discovered, is not *equally* hollow, void, and insubstantial. The Sutta itself says that *ALL* manifestations, no matter how exalted and unique they are, should be equally regarded. But people stop at the ordinary and don't apply the same context to their mystical meditative experiences, because then their mistaken emotional dependence on them—the fact that they still have the same attitude as ordinary people just in regard to a different thing—is automatically revealed.

    These similes the Buddha uses mean that things, the way in which they *already appear*, are hollow. So you don't need to be chasing down some special "direct experience" of emptiness, which is a fallacious notion, but simply understand that your everyday feelings, for example, ***while*** they are very intense and disagreeable sometimes, are not of any significance at all.

    The contemplation of lack of substance should not be done so as to *get rid* of the pressure that things exert, but to understand their nature *while* one is fully enduring their pressure.

    So instead of hoping for some special, esoteric experiences and *perceptions* of emptiness—yet another kind of worthless and insignificant  "shimmering mirage" that just happens to stand out from the rest—to arise on account of mechanical focusing, you would *genuinely* practice in line with the contemplation of the aggregates being hollow and void through renunciation and restraint.

    Restraining lustful and averse intentions in relation to certain cognized forms that are felt and perceived is how one is regarding all those things as a "lumps of foam, water bubbles, etc.". Committing sensual and averse actions is how you *do* implicitly regard the aggregates as substantial and meaningful whether you want it or not, regardless of what lofty ideas about emptiness you might have.

    All the talk on impermanence, suffering, not-self, and emptiness is just hot air unless a person is restraining their actions, because as the Buddha said, [actions are what the fool and the wise person are defined by](https://suttacentral.net/an3.2/en/bodhi?lang=en&reference=none&highlight=false).

    *"A wise person with great understanding is one who does not intend in a way that leads to their own harm, to the harm of others, or to the harm of both."*

### Sensual Pleasure

What is sensual pleasure?

1. Is it the five chords of sensual pleasure that are wished for, desired, agreeable and likelable, connected with sensual desire, and provocative of lust?
2. Is it the same as the gratification on account of the pleasure and joy that arises dependant on these five chords of sensual pleasure?
3. Is it something apart from these?

MN 13. The Greater Discourse on the Mass of Suffering
Sensual Pleasures
“And what, bhikkhus, is the gratification in the case of sensual pleasures? Bhikkhus, there are these five cords of sensual pleasure. What are the five? Forms cognizable by the eye that are wished for, desired, agreeable and likeable, connected with sensual desire, and provocative of lust. Sounds cognizable by the ear…Odours cognizable by the nose…Flavours cognizable by the tongue…Tangibles cognizable by the body that are wished for, desired, agreeable and likeable, connected with sensual desire, and provocative of lust. These are the five cords of sensual pleasure. Now the pleasure and joy that arise dependent on these five cords of sensual pleasure are the gratification in the case of sensual pleasures.”

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1ai7ys9/sensual_pleasure/kox2gzn/)** _2024-02-04 19:24:50:

    1. Yes. The five cords of sensual pleasure are the five "avenues" of experiencing sensual pleasure. And as the definition says, it's particularly those things which are wished for, desired and agreeable most importantly (and this will depend on the individual). It's not taking about *objects of the five senses* in general, because those are sometimes neutral or even disagreeable.

    Thus, it's a fallacy when people think that becoming oblivious to the entire range of the 5 senses means escaping sensual pleasure; the thing that they are escaping *to*, the object or what have you that they're focusing intently on, is *also* "wished for, desired, and agreeable". It just happens to not be as coarse as what can be perceived with the senses in ordinary life, which does not make the situation any better apart from that this pleasure doesn't require engaging in misconduct to seek out things externally. It's not a real escape, because no understanding of danger whatsoever, nor of gratification for that matter, has taken place.

    2. The gratification is the pleasure and joy that arise from experiencing things that are desired. So it's referring to something that you experience *on top of* the sense objects that are in themselves already agreeable, and it's on the basis of that "peripheral" feeling, not the "foreground" one which is always pleasant, that pleasure from the five senses can be *emotionally and "existentially"* gratifying at all.

    To illustrate this, imagine experiencing the most delightful pleasure of the senses while suffering from acute depression. The pleasure at the foreground is *exactly the same*, but at the background the mind is not really enjoying it, so it's not "gratifying" at all. If that pleasure were in itself what gratifies, and not the *mental* joy and elation that sometimes arises and sometimes doesn't, people could be cured from depression no matter how severe instantaneously by just getting bombarded with things that their senses enjoy.

    But everyone knows that that's not how it works. On the contrary, people often fall into depression due to having had *too much* access to sensual pleasures, to the point where nothing can make them feel that pleasure and joy on the mental level again, no matter how much pleasure their *senses* experience.
- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1ai7ys9/sensual_pleasure/kp0olq0/)** _2024-02-05 12:54:23 *(in reply to a comment not included)*:

    Such a person would need to recognize that the first step will not be joy, but the opposite. Virtue and restraint will pull them out of listlessness eventually, but only if they stick to the training even when they lack motivation (and if the mind is truly listless, then choosing restraint over sensuality should not be that big of an issue). Once they become established in virtue, the enjoyments that have been given up and which the mind was previously apathetic towards will begin to regain their "shine", since they've been put out of reach again.

    At that point, when they've already pulled themselves out of that mire, the person can begin to understand the gratification and danger in sensuality now that the mind "cares" about it again, thereby training it to become dispassionate for the right reason unlike before.

    >So an object being merely agreeable and pleasure arising on account of it is not an issue in and of itself. But if it agreeable alongside it being desired, provocative of lust etc then it is a sensual pleasure.

    That's right, as long as the mere *experiencing* of that object does not entail having broken the precepts, in which case it will be sensual inevitably. The precepts and celibacy cannot be broken without desire for sensual pleasure being the motivation.

    Apart from those things, you could tell if something is a sensual pleasure or not by checking your mind's reaction to the prospect of not getting it, or of it being taken away if you already have it. If there is apprehension, it is quite probably sensual. If there isn't, then it's likely just an agreeable object.

    But one has to be investigating that repeatedly (which is what "mindfulness" is all about), because the mind's attitude towards things is not fixed and can easily change.

    Check out the talk[ "Sensuality VS Agreeability".](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wc9XWIZ64Wc)  
     
    >Then the gratification that is experienced is the pleasure on account of the desire, lust etc.

    Yes, the gratification is always the relief that you get from "scratching the itch". If there is no itch in the first place, then there is no gratification of anything. It would just be agreeability that you wouldn't be bothered if it disappears.

    The best and only way to start even seeing what "maintaining the context in the background" means is upping one's threshold of restraint. Keeping the precepts and restraining the senses *forces* you, whether you realize it or not, to have at least some degree of context present without making it into a foreground because the "foreground" will always be occupied by the situation that's tempting you to break the precepts.

    If, having *not* done that to the necessary degree, one tries to start sustaining the context as a background to one's *thoughts*, which is takes much subtler discernment, there is no way that one will not be turning that context into an object of attention in some way, even if one thinks one isn't doing so. If those prerequisites have been met on the other hand, one won't even have to *try* not to make the context into an object of attention: that mistake will have become obvious and impossible to fall into.

    This is why the precepts and restraint are not "entrées before the main course". The entire gradual training is about the same background-foreground training, on successively more refined levels (keeping in mind that the first "stage" of keeping the precepts is not just about sticking to external rules of behavior, which in itself requires little to no context, but about "seeing the danger in the slightest fault" as the Buddha put it).

    >So I read your writings and listen to the videos looking for instructions to become a sotāpanna because, again, I am coming from a background of DOING things. But the actual instructions seem vague to me, and I feel like I'm floundering again (like when my practice started years ago).

    Well, in that case, you could start working on recognizing that need to "do something" beyond simply not acting out of desire and aversion as a "fault" just like breaking the precepts (because if you were truly succeeding in "just" restraining those things, you would have no doubts about the practice). That is one underlying tendency that you would not be able to restrain without a background context that goes in the opposite direction of where that pressure is pointing towards.

    >Any videos/writings on actual practice would be beneficial to me. I feel like I'm looking for a guidebook on becoming a sotāpanna.

    Depending on what you mean by "actual practice", we may or may not have anything to offer on that front. The true abandonment of defilements is by default something that goes over people's heads and seems "too ambiguous"; something "more palpable" is usually thought to be required. That's the real reason behind the Buddha's hesitation to teach the Dhamma soon after his enlightenment; it's not because he thought people would not be able to wrap their heads around observing one's breath intently, or radiating kind thoughts to others, which people, *children* even, with no prior experience can understand.

    If you have developed your bodily and verbal restraint as you say, then what you should work on would be your views. As you align your views closer to the Suttas, you may find that keeping the precepts is not as easy as it was with the views you previously had. Wrong view makes one's motivations for the same externally "good" behavior be mixed with greed, aversion and delusion, a good example being the view that the purpose of the practice is *getting* some special pleasure rather than *renouncing* all conceivable pleasures. Keeping the precepts and being restrained then becomes easy in the same way that quitting drinking and partying is not so difficult when it's being done for the purpose of a "greater" pleasure, e.g., making more money and having a more fulfilling life overall.

    Being virtuous without the promise of a "reward" on the other hand, but purely through the context that sensuality is harmful and a cause for suffering *in its own right*, not because it hinders the attainment of  this *other* pleasure or special meditative experiences, is felt very differently. Once the mind is fully confident, pliable and at ease with *that* kind of renunciation, which is already a form of samādhi,  sotāpatti is not far away.

    I said that with reference to SN 6.1:

    >“Nevermind trying to elucidate

    >What I attained with so much hardship.

    >By those afflicted by passion and aversion

    >This Dhamma is not easily understood"

    >It goes against-the-grain;

    >it's refined, profound, hard to see, and subtle.

    >Those inflamed with passion do not see it,

    >enveloped by the mass of darkness."

    The Dhamma that is widely taught nowadays, which people who are inflamed with passion do rather easily partake in just by doing some arbitrary method—that is "palpable" to the majority who has too much dust in their eyes to actually see—is something that he wouldn't have hesitated to teach.

    You see almost anyone, no matter how weak faculties they have and how much they continue to act out of passion—the very thing the Buddha said is the obstruction to clear seeing—attaining it at least partially as long as they put in the work, just like a mundane endeavor. There's nothing truly profound about it.

### Possible explanation on how meditation methods lead to enlightment?

I have found this article called "An Enlightened Mind Has Done This: Two Types of Objectification", written by a certain Mr. Roger Thisdell, who claims to have become enlighted in may 2021. There he explains how the meditation methods he´s trained in led to his enlightment: 

[https://www.rogerthisdell.com/post/an-enlightened-mind-has-done-this-two-types-of-objectification](https://www.rogerthisdell.com/post/an-enlightened-mind-has-done-this-two-types-of-objectification)

He also presents a phenomenological model of the enlighted mind, or so I understood, in this one: 

[https://www.rogerthisdell.com/post/centrelessness-boundarylessness-phenomenology-and-freedom-from-the-cage-of-the-mind](https://www.rogerthisdell.com/post/centrelessness-boundarylessness-phenomenology-and-freedom-from-the-cage-of-the-mind)

I would appreciate if the more experienced members of the community could help with pointers on instances of right/wrong view in the reasoning presented.

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1agagmv/possible_explanation_on_how_meditation_methods/kojvta8/)** _2024-02-02 05:54:34:

    The elephant in the room here is one celebrated but gratuitous notion which is greatly responsible for the distortion and decline of the Dhamma:

    The view that, _to any extent_, "things are not what they seem", and that _this_ is what insight is about.

    > We take those parts of ourselves initially perceived to be most intimately us, and observe them with sustained and clear perception so that we come to understand them **in a much more raw, bare-bones fashion (meaning without a narrative/conceptual/languaging interpretation).\[...\]**

    > When the adept meditator presses her fist into a wooden table **she** _**perceives**_ **the tactile points of pressure as amorphous clusters of sensations** that are not just expanding and contracting in terms of shape and intensity of feeling (which they do), but also the sense of the table or thing disappearing altogether, in a phenomenologically microscopic way. **The feeling of ‘hardness’ is flowing and evaporating, and not fixed for her.**

    > Through sustained observation, we come to see that all that appears in the mind is not only impermanent but empty in nature. **Appearances not only arise and then vanish, but as soon as they arise they are already disappearing;** and anything and everything that is scrutinised with clear attention is realised to be lacking inherent existence. No phenomenological data point has a solid core to it. All content taken to be an object is seen as a fabrication. _**Everything is a process. A verb.**_\[...\]

    > It is as though each data point of experience is known to itself, in its own place, and doesn’t relay back to some central point of knowing. If I feel a sensation in my knee, the knowing of the sensation is all in the knee and there isn’t a sense that that sensation is related to anything happening in the head. **Sensations appear in their own place and that information lacks directionality.**\[...\]The process was perceived like this:

    > Attention is aimed down to the knee from the head → sensation in knee detected → sensation data sent back up to the head → sensation is now known in the head, but happening ‘down there’.

    > **Now, all this directionality and time delay is removed from the process of knowing sensations.**This is particularly cool when hearing sounds, as the sounds are perceived/ processed/understood/known from their origin. **I no longer have the sense that I am hearing from my ears, or that sounds travel to my ears.** [...]

    The view underlying most of contemporary Buddhism and meditation is that [the problem of ignorance is in _**how**_ experience shows itself to us](https://www.hillsidehermitage.org/the-nature-of-ignorance/), based on which one concludes that by _altering_ how experience manifests, by bringing about any conceivable _**different mode of perception**_, one is abandoning ignorance and giving rise to the knowledge that the Buddha talked about.

    But this is catastrophically wrong for various reasons, and it is based on this wrong conception alone that meditation methods gain any value. The performance of these techniques eventually allows for these different modes of experiencing things (which can then be misconceived by an ignorant mind to be the true _anicca, dukkha,_ and _anattā_) to arise—there's no denying that, and it certainly takes a lot of dedication to achieve those results. But there is no reason why _meditation_ is the only way to reach this—psychoactive drugs could result in the same at least momentarily, which is why some people (including monks sometimes) believe that either of these two things _even remotely_ could be an instrument on the path to enlightenment (at least the one that the Buddha attained and taught the Dhamma for).

    > “From wrongness comes failure, not success. And how is it, bhikkhus , that from wrongness comes failure, not success?

    > “In a person of wrong view, wrong resolve comes into being. In a person of wrong resolve, wrong speech. In a person of wrong speech, wrong action. In a person of wrong action, wrong livelihood. In a person of wrong livelihood, wrong effort. In a person of wrong effort, wrong recollection. In a person of wrong recollection, wrong composure. In a person of wrong composure, **wrong knowledge. In a person of wrong knowledge, wrong liberation.**

    > “This is how from wrongness comes failure, not success.

    —AN 10.103

    The Buddha stated unambiguously what "the problem" is, and it's not the way in which your perceptions _**arise**_ (which includes whether or not there seems to be a "center" to them), but the _**attitude**_ that you hold towards experience, with no regard in any shape or form for _how_ it has arisen.

    > “Therefore, bhikkhus, **any kind of form whatsoever**, whether past, future, or present, internal or external, **gross or subtle, inferior or superior,** far or near, all form should be seen as it is with correct wisdom thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’

    > **“Any kind of feeling whatsoever … Any kind of perception whatsoever … Any kind of activities whatsoever … Any kind of consciousness whatsoever**, whether past, future, or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near, all consciousness should be seen as it is with correct wisdom thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’

    —SN 22.59

    > “Now this, bhikkhus, is the noble truth of the origin of suffering: it is this craving which leads to renewed existence, accompanied by delight and lust, seeking delight here and there; that is, craving for sensual pleasures, craving for being, craving for non-being.

    > “Now this, bhikkhus, is the noble truth of the cessation of suffering: it is the remainderless fading away and cessation of that same craving, the giving up and relinquishing of it, freedom from it, non-reliance on it.

    —SN 56.11

    > “Bhikkhus, when one **lives contemplating danger in things that can fetter, craving ceases.** With the cessation of craving comes cessation of clinging; with the cessation of clinging, cessation of existence … cessation of birth … aging-and-death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair cease. Such is the cessation of this whole mass of suffering.

    > “Suppose, bhikkhus, an oil lamp was burning in dependence on oil and a wick, and the man would not pour oil into it or adjust the wick from time to time. Thus, when the former supply of fuel is exhausted, that oil lamp, not being fed with any more fuel, lacking sustenance, would be extinguished. So too, when one lives contemplating danger in things that can fetter, craving ceases…. Such is the cessation of this whole mass of suffering.”

    —SN 12.53

    > “Whatever ascetics and brahmins at present **regard** that in the world with a pleasant and agreeable nature as permanent, as happiness, as self, as healthy, as secure: they are nurturing craving. In nurturing craving they are nurturing acquisition. In nurturing acquisition they are nurturing suffering. In nurturing suffering they are not freed from birth, aging, and death; they are not freed from sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair; they are not freed from suffering, I say.

    >“Whatever ascetics and brahmins at present **regard** that in the world with a pleasant and agreeable nature as impermanent, as suffering, as nonself, as a disease, as fearful: they are abandoning craving. In abandoning craving … **they are freed from suffering, I say.**

    —SN 12.66

    These rarefied modes of perception that meditation techniques can give rise to are also within "that in the world which is pleasant and agreeable", the true sense of self being on the level of how you _regard that._ It's the background context and assumptions you hold towards all those "insights" and experiences (and that you're drifting further and further away from recognizing by putting the emphasis on these "special" instances of the aggregates). Whether you _perceive_ a center to the experience or not is beyond irrelevant to the understanding of _anattā_, and thinking that liberation is to be found in that is ironically a failure to see _**all**_ perception as lacking any eminence whatsoever (which is what true ["emptiness"](https://suttacentral.net/sn22.95/en/bodhi?lang=en) is about).

    The insight, the "transcendental" knowledge the Suttas talk about, is about understanding the banal and mundane things that you have always experienced since the day you were born and before (elation, sadness, lamentation, confusion, pressure, uncertainty, restlessness, desire, aversion...), not about _**experiencing**_ transcendental things, which is a contradiction in terms: as soon as you regard an experience—which can never be anything apart from form, feeling, perception, intentions and consciousness—as transcendental and liberative, you have no clue what is truly transcendental and liberative for that very reason.

    And, of course, the Buddha's diagnosis of what the root of suffering is forces one to effect a fundamental change in one's actions and way of living life, whereas this doesn't, as long as you can put in the time for it, like any other mundane skill.

    As a sidenote to all this, this wrong view of what insight is about naturally leads to the loss of the categorical divide in the Suttas between puthujjana and ariya, as well as the assumption that the former can just _choose_ to regard their in the way an ariya would if they just try. This ensures that whoever puts their effort into this won't ever develop themselves in the way that matters so that they _can_ regard their experience rightly in the first place (in the Buddha's definition) because they think they _already are doing so_ by looking at things "objectively" so that there is no sense of self, failing to see that one is a puthujjana _**because**_ whatever one imagines the sense of self to be actually isn't, and _**because**_ the true sense of self survives completely unscathed behind any observation of not-self one may engage in.

### Relationship between precepts and craving

Up till now I thought that keeping the five precepts was to prevent actions rooted in coarse forms of craving, but after reflecting on this, I think there may be some issues with this understanding. For me it's certainly true that if I were to break the five precepts, it's quite clearly due to the resistance to what is currently felt. But these actions of killing, stealing, lying, etc., seem entirely possible without craving.

For example, the Nazis seemed to have entertained a whole lot of dehumanization of the Jews which allowed them to kill them quite dispassionately at such a high rate. I imagine there's probably certain people in the world where the act of killing has been stripped of its significance of taking-the-life-of-another and become just another mechanical act in the same way as, say, washing the dishes. Maybe hitmen fit the bill here: someone calls them up, tells them to kill this person for whatever amount, they find their target at a random place, shoot them up, and job done. In the same way as I throw out garbage once a week -- there's no craving involved here.

The reason why I'm thinking in terms of this hypothetical is because if it is the case that precepts can be broken without coarse forms of craving, then the whole reason of keeping them to restrain from coarse craving seems to be redundant. And so that must imply there's some other more important reason/principle that I'm missing out on here.

The reason why I kept the precept to not kill is because I used to kill tens of bed bugs every day because they made it impossible for me to sleep, and then one day I recognized the possibility that perhaps these bed bugs are just like me and other humans, except in different form: all of them wanting to live and not wanting to die. So then I gave up killing, but I still recognize the possibility of killing in extremely threatening circumstances.

The reason why I kept the precept to not steal and lie was because in both these acts there was an element of hiding an action from others. While I might steal and consequently hide the act of stealing, in doing so, the entire burden and weight of that act would always be on me. Constantly thinking: "what if others find out about this?"; it felt like these actions were literally in my shadows ALL the time. Whenever I was alone, I would just be constantly reminded of what I did and how bad it was regardless of how insignificant the act was, like even stealing one dollar. At a certain point, the burden of what I'd done in the past was so much that it made me crazy and I realized it'll be beneficial for me to never steal and lie.

I'm too young to break the other precepts, but I naturally didn't incline towards it.

These were my reasons for keeping the precepts prior to the Dhamma. But when I encountered HH, I recall hearing that they should be kept as development of the mind/restraining coarse forms of craving. And so I thought that that was a better and more superior principle (which could then be extended to other acts much more naturally) to mine, but now I seem to be in a dilemma where it seems even this reason has something superior to it.

As a side note, reflecting on what I've written, I notice that I hold the view that craving is a kind of on/off switch; sometimes there is craving, sometimes there isn't. But given the fact that there is craving so long as there is avijja, that suggests one inflicted with avijja cannot not have craving at any particular instance of their life. But this doesn't make sense. There are clearly times when there's no pressure/resistance towards anything within my experience; some instances where I'm very calm or serene, or even after satisfying sensual desires and thoroughly having the sense that I'm "done with it" for now.

Would appreciate any help here.

    >But given the fact that there is craving so long as there is avijja, that suggests one inflicted with avijja cannot not have craving at any particular instance of their life.

    This is where the gist is at. You should keep the precepts not because they make you not suffer (i.e. not have craving) *now*, but because keeping them reduces your *liability* to suffering (i.e. liability to craving). Yes, craving is always there to some degree for as long as there is ignorance, but that doesn't mean that it's *symptoms*, such as pressure and suffering, are always there (or at least not in the strength that a puthujjana who by default overlooks these things would be able to recognize them .

    While a person who gets used to killing might at a certain point stop experiencing the strong craving and therefore suffering that lead them to commit that action in the first place, becoming "numb" to it, they will still  unavoidably be sentencing themselves with every further action to feel that much more "confined" by displeasure, due to feeling the impulse to get rid of it by any means like they did the previous million times (just like a drug addiction). The *assumption* that displeasure requires a response is inevitably strengthened, and the strength of that assumption is the degree to which *not* responding to displeasure will result in suffering (same for sensuality).

    >The reason why I kept the precept to not kill is because I used to kill tens of bed bugs every day because they made it impossible for me to sleep, and then one day I recognized the possibility that perhaps these bed bugs are just like me and other humans, except in different form: all of them wanting to live and not wanting to die. So then I gave up killing, but I still recognize the possibility of killing in extremely threatening circumstances.

    So in this example, it's not that once your aggregate of virtue is developed you would cease to feel (even acute) displeasure on account of the bed bugs. The peace from virtue is in recognizing you no longer needing to do anything *about* that displeasure no matter how acute it is, and thus it's not a problem. Virtue is thus the stepping stone to learning how to "not suffer amidst suffering".

    Therefore, *any* breach of virtue, no matter how much it hurts or doesn't *right now*, is cultivating the opposite, "suffering amidst suffering", because you're cultivating the attitude that displeasure (or lack of pleasure) *is* in fact such a big problem that it seemingly justifies these unrestrained actions. If that arisen feeling was not implicitly suffered-in-regard-to, no matter how little, you wouldn't have committed the action in the first place.

### Root of hindrances

From what I understand, Ajahn Nyanamoli advocates to train until one is able to see when one's intentions are rooted in the hindrances and to endure the discomfort that these hindrances brought with them without acting out of it, doing it over time (months, years) will allow the mind to cool down and these hindrances to lose their grip.

&#x200B;

Is there a need to keep digging at the root of the hindrances after or during the process?

&#x200B;

Recently I've started to put the finger on the fact that sometimes symptoms ill-will or agitation seem to arise when something doesn't go as planned.

Anger/irritation can make itself felt when I'm expecting something of my fellow man that I judge normal or common civism and the opposite happens (e.g. I'm waiting in line, someone come and go at the start of the line instead of the back).

Agitation and worry can make itself felt when I'm expecting the circumstances to go one way, and it doesn't go as planned (e.g. I thought traffic would be as usual and that I would be on time at work, but there is an accident on the road and now I'm going to be late and everything that goes with it).

&#x200B;

From my point of view it seems like ill-will or agitation weren't already present, but the fact that I had expectations and that they got undermined by circumstances caused these hindrances to show up.

From here, should one accept that they have expectations and that it would be undermined by circumstances resulting in hindrances, and endure these hindrances on that level?

Or should one work on these expectations and free themselves from it so that the hindrances can't appear because of it in the first place?

&#x200B;

I come to you essentially because I don't exclude that there is a possibility the hindrances were already there and that it could be why circumstances not meeting expectations resulted in symptoms of ill-will and agitation, since this doesn't appear to me to be the case I might have it completely backward and the task could then be more daunting than what I thought.

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1afe5du/root_of_hindrances/kojiso4/)** _2024-02-02 04:02:36:

    >Is there a need to keep digging at the root of the hindrances after or during the process?

    It's not like there is a  deeper "root" of them that a person would be able to access and "dig out" while the prior training has not yet unfolded sufficiently. Rather, for as long as one's virtue and sense-restraint (not sense-denial) could be more strict than it is at the moment, one could address the hindrances better.

    It cannot be emphasized enough that the hindrances *are* the actions that are committed on account of pressure, be they coarse or very subtle. The point of the training that people have a tendency to want to do as soon as possible, the which is the mental purification part, is about exactly the same restraint as the bodily and verbal purification. It's not like then you start "digging up" some hidden energies in your mind, but that the recognition of your own intentions behind your actions is now sufficient for the way in which upi *mentally* proliferate thoughts and pressures to become apparent *on its own*, without having to "dig it up" deliberately. One then is able to restrain effortlessly in the same way you'd prevent yourself from breaking a precept: you are *already* aware of yourself about to do something with your arm or say something with your mouth, it's impossible not to be, so you simply abstain from it. But the accurate recognition of those choices won't be even there without thorough development of restraint in regard to the coarser choices., just as it's impossible to even notice, let alone get rid of,[ the subtle impurities in gold while the coarse ones are still present.](https://suttacentral.net/an3.101/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=sidebyside&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin)

    So, it's not the expectations that you have about other people, or anything else that you could be aware of by *trying* to be aware of it by choice. It's something that will eventually become apparent by itself only once the mind  has become steady at the level where there is no further work to be done regarding body and speech. And that alone should result in a certain degree of[ "blameless ease".](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoOIYwY39eE)

    >So were I mixed things up is that one doesn't have to restraint themselves until they are able to recognize when their intentions are rooted in the hindrances, but rather until they are able to recognize when their intentions are rooted in taṇhā in relation to contact/feeling **resulting** in them acting out in the form of the hindrances?

    Yes, the hindrances are not in this or that intention that you can just "catch", it's the general principle of acting out of feeling that underlies one's entire existence. And for as long as feelings are acted out of through body and speech, the way in which the same thing is happening through mental actions cannot possibly be discerned.

    >It doesn't seem to be the case for me at the moment, because when "mentally proliferating thoughts and pressures become apparent on their own" (say in a heated moment when irritation is there, because it's one of those I know the best), I am aware of me proliferating what I could do before doing it, I am then also aware of myself about to do it, but then it's not so simple to abstain from it.  
    Seeing perfectly well what I could do, there is then a pressure as if this is what I must do and I really have to take it upon myself to not do it, really go against the grain of my entire body needing to do that. 

    If you get to that stage in the first place where the mind is irritated and it's painful not to act out, then the proliferation already happened without notice. What I'm referring to is that the hindrances can only start to be abandoned once one's discernment is such that one recognizes the "becoming irritated" to begin with as a *choice* (again, just like a bodily or verbal choice) not when irritation is already there and one then has to abandon it. By then it's too late, and the fact that it happens means that the mind still cannot recognize the subtler mental choices that lead to that irritation even *arising*.

    >And I'm wondering if this isn't because I didn't develop enough the contentment in the virtuous behavior, so when big pressure is there the choice going with the thoughts "why should I resist and make myself feel so bad? Clearly acting out will release me from that unpleasant moment" takes over the other one "let's not give in but take pleasure in being able to renounce this unvirtuous behavior".

    Well, it's not really a matter of "if only if had done *that*, this wouldn't have happened". One has to accept that these things are inevitable to a degree, which is how one sees that there is still work to be done. If one were at the stage were one *could* prevent these things, they wouldn't be happening to begin with, or at least you wouldn't be having any doubts whatsoever about how to go about it.

    There is never some quick fix that'll sort everything out. Mistakes in the application of some meditation technique can be fixed in no time just by implementing someone's "tips", but with this there will never be quick or sudden improvements,  because it's about actually purifying the depths of your being from passion, aversion, and muddledness. "Success" will thus not be there to the exact degree that those 3 things are still there, and vice versa.

    >“Just as, Pahārāda, the great ocean slants, slopes, and inclines gradually, not dropping off abruptly, so too, in this Dhamma and discipline penetration to final knowledge occurs by gradual training, gradual activity, and gradual practice, not abruptly.

### How is Stream Entry not a “special experience?”

I’ve read this sentiment a couple times recently.  It seems to me that the moment one achieves this that it would be quite special!

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1ae95hq/how_is_stream_entry_not_a_special_experience/kk963th/)** _2024-01-30 13:23:53:

    What u/no_thingness  wrote is essentially correct:

    There can be a "special experience" of joy and relief on account of *recognizing* stream-entry, but stream-entry in itself is not an experience; it's an *understanding* of the nature of all experience. So no matter how lofty and sublime the realization that one now sees the Four Noble Truths is, *that* experience is also known as impermanent, suffering, and unownable, so in that sense it's not more "special" than the experience of any other feeling which has been understood in that same way. The usual view is that one understands the nature of things *because* of getting some experience, and that's completely the wrong way round.

    It's thought that stream-entry is achieved by getting a "glimpse" of Nibbāna, and therefore the *experience* of that glimpse *is* the breakthrough. But that's plain absurd because if you forgot about that glimpse, in just the same way as you would forget some experience that happened in your childhood that was *at the time* really special, you would lose your sotāpatti.

    It's irrelevant whether people then claim that "No no, ***this*** experience is different from all others and you can never forget it". That's just a testament to how they haven't at all understood how "*everything* that is of the nature to arise is of the nature to cease".

    The point is not that *stream entry*, i.e. understanding the Four Noble Truths, is not special because that would be ridiculous, but that this understanding is not measured by an "experience" or special "glimpse" that you get one evening which suddenly turns you into a sotāpanna, which is generally the sort of result people expect.

    "Experiences" are irrelevant; the understanding of the *nature* of any experience is what is "special" and a puthujjana needs to strive for.

### Unable to take the precept of non-lying

I am not able to take the precept of non-lying with its full value. It feels like it's just too much weight I could take on. Even celibacy seems easier to me than this. It is not like I keep lying and so it is hard to take up this precept but I have lied on occasions. When I contemplated on what things exactly prevent me from taking this precept, I came to know that it was due to emotional attachment to my parents / family. Specifically, there have been some situations where if I had to tell a small deliberate lie that would result in much lesser unpleasant emotions to my parents or so, I have chosen to lie. And if I do take the precept right on, I know internally that I am not ready if the worst possible thing would challenge me.

Here in my culture lying isn't even considered something quite bad or so. I am not trying to rationalize lying but just that in my environment how trivial is lying considered and how my attitude towards it has been unfortunately shaped.

I am really not sure how to go about this. I have been keeping the other 4 precepts and celibacy but I guess that this might be a fruitless endeavor. I would be grateful for any comments on this.

    With this sort of situation, it's always the same principle: one will not be able to get out of it until one has a good enough reason to put up with the displeasure of restraining oneself. It's not about hoping that restraining yourself and being more virtuous will *stop* being painful.

    To an extent, it can help to clarify exactly *why* lying is for your own harm. More specifically, how the choice to not tell the truth in every single situation, though seemingly less unpleasant on the surface, involves a deeper, more "thorny" kind of suffering than any form of displeasure that would come from telling the truth.

    Lying can be momentarily less painful but it always entangles you more on the emotional level, because next time, telling the truth will be that much more difficult—you're becoming more existentially dependent on avoiding displeasure each time you do it.

    The pain of telling the truth is momentarily worse, but there is no accumulation of burden for the future on account of it. It's like the pain of enduring heat, cold, hunger, etc. It can be very sharp, but emotionally it doesn't *have* to bother you if train your mind, and it doesn't bring any additional repercussions.

### Am I discerning correctly?

Trying to wrap my head around using mindfulness to discern my thoughts and behaviours. I would be grateful if someone could scrutinise my thoughts so far with the following example:

Context: former binge eating disorder. Currently eat 90% healthy, squashed my habit of needing occassional snacks to keep my diet "sustainable", now eating more like a monk i.e. gathering foodstuffs and eating them indiscriminately instead of needing a recipe meal, trying to reach my goal of not needing junk/treats ever again.

The other night, work was terrible. Incredibly understaffed, having to work through my breaks and doing lots of overtime. Sleep deprived. Mind is agitated. I didn't have time to cook a substantive meal, so I had to run to the shop and get a sandwich, scoff it down and get back to work. On the way home at night, I wanted to get a takeaway. I was mindful and knew I wasn't hungry as the sandwich removed that hunger, but I thought that because work was terrible and ruined my break, I wanted to recuperate, basically 'feel better' by indulging in a takeaway. Typing it now cringes me, but I was very distressed in the midst of it.

Anyway, I started paying attention to my thoughts. The first thought was 'it's been a shitty night and I deserve to treat myself', then the next thought was 'I had to work through my break for the fifth time this week and it's unfair, I want to recuperate and have some me-time'. Thought after that was 'this is too hard'. I understood the thoughts as manifestations of craving, and recollected that if I gave into them, the next time I get cravings, it would be due to my past actions. However the pressure got incredibly strong and I thought 'sorry man, it's too difficult tonight, I give in' and was about to pull up to buy food. Then I stopped and realised that very last thought was no different from the rest, but I identified it as 'me' thinking, as if there was all these thoughts over there, but I'm over here observing it all with my own thoughts. As soon as I recollected that, I was able to resist the pressure. After that, I felt proud of myself for resisting the pressure. However I then recognised that the feeling of pride wasn't my doing either, and identifying with it would perpetuate the permanent sense of self I already feel, so I stopped identifying with it in that moment, and with that I stopped caring whether the feeling of pride persisted or disappeared because it had nothing to do with me. Then I went home and slept.

Is this... at least... a less wrong way of discernment?

    The fact that you restrained yourself is good, but there is still some "looking at the wrong place" happening.

    >Anyway, I started paying attention to my thoughts. 

    This is where you started on the wrong foot. Don't try to pay attention to your *thoughts* to find where craving is: thoughts will always be secondary manifestations, *symptoms* of the underlying craving. This is exactly why the "pressure got incredibly strong" in the first place: through trying to deal with the symptoms, the illness was being maintained., i.e., the attitude of "I want to get rid of these thoughts" is itself rooted in the same craving.

    Next time, look at what you are *feeling* overall, in the broadest sense, not in regard to this or that particular thought. That general feeling will be either a ease, unease, or neither. In this case there was a feeling of unease (that was there even *before* you were tempted to get more food), and all you had to do is recognize that and endure it on *that* level, not caring at all about what thoughts you were experiencing for as long as that feeling was still being endured. And you had to be doing that from when you were at work experiencing displeasure, not *after* when the temptations to act out of it started to manifest, which would've prevented them from being nearly as oppressive. By then it's too late, and all you can do at that point is grit your teeth and not act out.

    With this, the actual root of the issue, the tendency to *act out* of that feeling, which includes indulging in its thoughts *and* trying to get rid of them, would've worn out. If there is less pressure to act out of that background feeling, then the same thoughts might even arise but their *weight* would be much less, and you would have no trouble ignoring them. Just like when you might have a thought about eating your favorite food when you have no appetite at all: it's the same thought and the same prospect of pleasure, but you are not moved by it.

    >I only focused on the thoughts because being untrained, I often identify with the voice in my head, thinking it's genuinely me talking. That's why even when I'm feeling bad, I'll have thoughts trying to convince me "this time, due to XYZ reason, it's okay to give in". Maybe this comes from lack of understanding or clarity on why it's obviously never okay to give in, hence there shouldn't be "consultation" with my thoughts where I delight in possible exceptions to giving in?

    It's your attitude towards the present feeling that makes thoughts be an issue. So on the level of thoughts, you can *think* you are not identifying with other coarser thoughts ("the voices"), but for as long as there is an underlying tendency to either resist the general feeling or delight in it, that whole choice to not identify with thoughts will still be a subtler thought that you are identified with.

    If you recognize the enduring feeling correctly and restrain yourself from delight or aversion on *that* level, no amount of "voices in your head" can cause you to have delight or aversion, no matter their content. And that goes the other way too: no matter what your thoughts and reasoning say, if the action will be rooted in delight or aversion towards what you're feeling here and now, it *will* be wrong. That's why what's wholesome or unwholesome always depends on your state of mind, i.e., what attitude is there regarding what you feel right now, not on what you *think* is wholesome or unwholesome.

    >In the video "sixth sensed animal" Ajahn Nyanamoli used the analogy of walking your dog and seeing a deer in the distance. Your dog hasn't noticed it yet but you have, and you know once your dog sees it it will start barking and will try to drag you. Is noticing the deer before the dog basically the same thing as me noticing the unpleasant feeling during work, way before I even was tempted to get food?

    Yes, that's exactly the principle I was alluding to.

    So you can take that as a general rule of thumb: whenever you "suddenly" find yourself really pressured to do something, it must have been because at some point, when things were still calm, you  started "moving" in that direction with a bit of delight, aversion, or carelessness that *back then* you brushed off as "fine". But it will always end up snowballing, and every further "harmless" engagement in that direction will make it more painful to restrain yourself later.

### Results versus deliberate decisions

I want to see if I am totally mistaken or not…

The way I understand, and in some (very few) cases know from experience, is that attachment,e.g.  is not something we eliminate directly as a willful act, but is a consequence of insight into the nature of things. 

Almost every aspect of the dhamma i would claim to understand (again, very minimal) has turned out like this.  It of course requires volition in the direction of things, but i have yet to say to myself “i will renounce this or that” or “i will no longer experience an emotional bond with this or that” and have it happen because i willed it.  My meager progress is almost like the rest of my experience:  i ultimately have no say in the matter; once i understood that i cannot breathe underwater it became impossible for me to ever even need to consider it.  That is an awful example, but hopefully my overall question and perspective are clearer.  

I appreciate any input.

    >The way I understand, and in some (very few) cases know from experience, is that attachment,e.g. is not something we eliminate directly as a willful act, but is a consequence of insight into the nature of things.

    >Almost every aspect of the dhamma i would claim to understand (again, very minimal) has turned out like this. It of course requires volition in the direction of things, but i have yet to say to myself “i will renounce this or that” or “i will no longer experience an emotional bond with this or that” and have it happen because i willed it.

    This is correct in a certain sense. The mind is what is attached to things, and it simply doesn't work such that you could directly tell it to "drop" things. All one's direct volition can do is either proliferate or starve the mind's attachments.

    So it is one's previous repeated choices to abstain from volitional actions that would proliferate attachment (choices of virtue and sense restraint) that eventually wear it out. There must be *some* degree of understanding involved in those choices for them to have a sound basis (e.g., knowing that the goal is freedom from suffering and that certain actions factually take one in the opposite direction), but true insight always arises as a *result* of attachments having worn away, not the other way around.

    This means that renunciation will inevitably be painful initially and will entail going "against the grain". One should not expect insight or disenchantment to arise *first* so that renunciation then becomes easy.

    >“What do you expect, Aggivessana? It is impossible that what is to be known through renunciation, seen through renunciation, reached through renunciation, realized through renunciation, will ever be known, seen, reached or realized by Prince Jayasena, who lives amidst sensuality, enjoys sensuality, itches with thoughts of sensuality, burns with the fever of sensuality, and is engaged in the pursuit of sensuality.

    >Is it worthwhile to sit doing nothing and resisting the minds attempts to make me act in some way as a beginning practice or is it simply a one time exercise meant to demonstrate to people that neutral feeling is unpleasant and the mind will want to distract itself?

    Neither really. As a beginner, that attempt to "formally" resist the minds attempts to make you act in some way will be acting in some way right then and there. One starts out by not even seeing as it is what the pressure to act, thinking one can "observe" it directly like that.

    This is why there is a Gradual Training in a certain order. The stage of sitting down in an empty dwelling and purifying the mind from hindrances comes at the point when one isn't a beginner at all anymore, and is already able to grasp the signs of their mind.

    Prior to that, one's conception of what the hindrances are will necessarily be way too coarse and inaccurate for one to abandon them, and the attempt to do so will result in either winding oneself up into frustration, or falling into the trap of "concentration", which is so attractive precisely because brings about a wrong kind of peace that *doesn't* require development in the Gradual Training beforehand.

### Role of virtue beyond stream entry

As the title states, I'm interested in clarifying the role of virtue beyond stream entry. I understand why and how virtue and restraint play a key role in developing the Right View prior to stream entry. But once the fruit of stream entry has been attainewd, one's liability to suffer has been reduced to "7 grains of sand". At this point, they have the understanding that makes them "incapable of suffering amidst suffering". So, my question is, essentially, why bother being virtuous any more? Why follow the Noble 8fold path?

My current hypothesis is that it has to do with the belief in rebirth. As in, a stream enterer has at most 7 lifetimes left to live, so it makes sense to continue developing their practice in this life in order to shave down those remaining lifetimes and achieve "final extinguishment" as soon as possible. This is all well and good.

However, without the belief in rebirth, the entire framework seems to break down. In the sense that a stream enterer is incapable of suffering amidst suffering, but mundane pleasant vedana is still "agreeable" and easy to access, while Right Samadhi, which is supposedly far superior to anything that's accessible through the senses (again, something they would need to take on faith prior to experiencing for themselves), is much more difficult to cultivate, so they can "settle for" enjoying mundane pleasant vedana without any craving or attachment, afford to be lazy and careless all the time, and even engage in "wrong" conduct in this life with no liability to suffer on account of it.

What's wrong with my reasoning here?

E: I thought I'd reframe the question here -- Basically, if a stream enterer is "incapable of suffering amidst suffering", and therefore has barely any liability to suffering left, what motivates them to keep practicing? Is it the belief in rebirth? Or is it that whatever suffering that remains is painful enough that they still need to maintain their practice?

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1acfdj3/role_of_virtue_beyond_stream_entry/kjx7030/)** _2024-01-28 07:08:04:

    >What's wrong with my reasoning here?

    Nothing, really. This is exactly why the lay stream-enterers of the Buddha's time would go back to their normal lives despite the fact that understanding the danger in sensuality is part and parcel of their insight. The understanding they gained did not depend on them continuing to follow any form of virtue or observances, which is in contrast to a puthujjana: if the latter stops "doing" whatever they regard as the practice, they will fall away from whatever development they had. This is why a stream enterer does not hold on to *any* practices and observances, not even the "right" ones of virtue, sense restraint, etc. (Keeping in mind that holding on to them and following them are not at all the same).

    Furthermore, even if they wanted to, they *cannot* experience the [results of their misconduct](https://suttacentral.net/an3.100/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=sidebyside&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin) in the same way and degree as a puthujjana. Being free from self view and knowing the noble truths is the reason for that:  the suffering caused by their actions does not "land" due their insight of not-self. The suffering that they *do* experience is the one that leads them to [commit the actions in the first place](https://suttacentral.net/an5.142/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=sidebyside&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin), and this is absolutely minuscule in comparison.

    And this is what people misunderstand: being free from suffering does not mean you don't experience unpleasant feeling; it means your mind is not troubled by it when it comes (that's what freedom from kamma is about). So even though a sotāpanna is liable to experience a lot of displeasure on account of their remaining fetters of sensualty, and ill will, that displeasure does not "touch" them. The feelings that come on account of those fetters and of acting out of them are within the first arrow, not the second. In other words, the difference between a sotāpanna and an Arahant or Anāgāmi is the magnitude of the first arrow that they experience, because of which the former is still liable to *act* in unwholesome ways due to that first arrow. The latter two are incapable of committing sensual or averse actions because they don't experience the pressure to do so in the first place.

    That being said, the sotāpanna's degree of development does entail a great reduction of the intensity of the first arrow as well, meaning that there are certain things that they would not even be *pressured* to do, namely the actions that would land them in the lower realms. This does not mean that they cannot break the five precepts, but that the *mental state* behind their transgression can never be as twisted as it can be for a puthujjana. (AN 3.101 referenced above). For example, they might intentionally kill under certain severe, threatening or very careless circumstances, but pure cruelty would most likely be impossible. Externally though, the action might look the same as a puthujjana's.

    “Bhikkhus, a person accomplished in view has given up six things. What six? Personality view, doubt, holding on to virtue and duty, and forms of passion, aversion, and muddledness that lead to states of misery. *\[apāya; traditionally this means the literal hells and so on, but it would also include intense suffering in this very life\]*

    —AN 6.90

    The only external actions that one who sees categorically cannot commit are outlined in AN 6.94. Those things cannot be done *without* the intensity of the 3 defilements that would lead them to states of misery.

    So, in the end, a noble disciple will only continue striving in the Noble Eightfold Path to the degree that they feel dissatisfied with the amount of freedom they gained. Some of them would be perfectly content with it, and they would have a natural tendency to still adhere to the five precepts the vast majority of the time, but they would not necessarily undertake things like celibacy and sense restraint, which are the requirements to take the mind *beyond* where it already is, for puthujjana and noble disciple alike. But within 7 births at most, or even at the time of their death in the current life, they will become dissatisfied with their progress and will take up the training seriously again.

    A puthujjana should purify their behavior like their life depends on it if they want to have a chance to get the Right View, but people's conception or a sotāpanna who is *always* pefectly diligent and virtuous, and who would suffer on account of their misconduct, is due to their own holding on to virtue and observances.

    True freedom is true freedom—there are no "buts" or "ifs" to worry about once it's attained. Adhering to constraints is only necessary for *progressing* towards greater freedom.
- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1acfdj3/role_of_virtue_beyond_stream_entry/kk3nmpk/)** _2024-01-29 13:26:52 *(in reply to a comment not included)*:

    A sotāpanna can transgress without having to experience the unwholesome states (chiefly remose) that would (rightly) haunt a puthujjana as a result of the very same actions.

    So a puthujjana can be perfectly well behaved, meaning that such unwholesome states will not be manifesting, but when they *do* slip and the mind starts showing its underlying tendencies, they know no escape. If they keep misbehaving past a certain point, they will start factually losing the modicum of grip on their minds that they had.

    This is why an ordinary person cannot conceive of how a sotāpanna can let loose as much as they want and essentially not suffer, never actually *regressing* from the Dhamma. The suffering of a sotāpanna, since it is IN the very performance of the actions itself (including mental ones), can easily be eliminated and the state of peace restored by simply undertaking the training again and abstaining from those behaviors.

    In short, there is no suffering as soon as virtue and sense restraint are re-established. That's why all a sotāpanna really needs to do to become an Arahant is adhere to those two things long enough, so that they become *incapable* of not adhering to them. The "liberation by mind and by wisdom where all unwholesome states cease without remainder" grow naturally as a result of that, and they would become like the fifth type of person.

    You're right, it seems I misremembered the letter of the Sutta, but the message is the same.

    The 4 types of people who still transgress and/or experience regret are being told to dispel the influxes (āsava) of transgression or of remorse and to further develop their mind and wisdom, to gradually destroy the āsavas and be like the 5th person (the Arahant). This means that *all* of these 4 individuals are at least sotāpannas, since a puthujjana [cannot "dispel āsavas"](https://suttacentral.net/mn2/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin) (also implied in AN 2.11), and there is no guarantee that they are heading towards Arahantship just by restraining their behavior. That is to say, they can *make choices* to restrain themselves (and should), but, unlike the sotāpanna, there are likely to be *other* defilements behind those choices (such as wrong views/motivations like self-mortification and denial).

    A sotāpanna understands the "liberation by mind and liberation by wisdom where unwholesome states cease", but not *without remainder* (which is the Arahant). It is for that very reason that they can dispel not only the defilements that pushed them to transgress, but even the remorse that would come from it, but not to the point where they will never do it again in the future.

    So you could put it this way: the results of a sotāpanna's actions would arise (remorse for example, pressure of hindrances in general), but they don't *have to* experience them if they don't want to. They can do away with those things if they just try, and keep developing their minds as if nothing happened. It's like someone who gets locked into a room for which they have the key: they might choose to stay in it (keep experiencing the unwholesome states) if they don't feel a particular urge to leave, but whenever they decide to leave, they *will* leave.

    >Though a fine thoroughbred may stumble,  
    it soon stands firm again.  
    Even so is one accomplished in vision—  
    a disciple of the Buddha.

    —Theragātha 1.45

    So yes, hiri and ottappā, the first 2 of the 5 powers a noble disciple possesses, should be employed by them so that they *want* to "get up" (or get out of the room) as soon as possible, or so that they don't stumble in the first place. But these 2 powers are separate from regret, which is a hindrance that they would abandon *through* hiri and ottappā.

    A puthujjana, in contrast, may well not be able to get up at all if they fell too hard (ending up in the lower realms), or they may get up on the wrong foot, so to speak (take up the restraint wrongly).

### Spreading a heart full of love

Hi fellow practitioners, 

I saw a video of Ajahn Nyanamoli talking about how the common practice of ‘spreading and sending’ metta- is basically useless, because, if I understood correctly, if your heart is truly full of metta you don’t have to spread it around, it’s instead just a friendly disposition toward all beings and phenomena.
He also said that the common practice of spreading metta is often used as a “coverup” and as an escape from difficult emotions- avoiding the task at hand- and that all sounds very sensible to me. 

But why does some suttas talk in this manner, how to make sense of texts like the one below? 
Anuruddhasutta—Bhikkhu Sujato. 

“And what is the limitless release of the heart? It’s when a mendicant meditates spreading a heart full of love to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of love to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will. They meditate spreading a heart full of compassion … They meditate spreading a heart full of rejoicing … They meditate spreading a heart full of equanimity to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of equanimity to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will. This is called the limitless release of the heart.
And what is the expansive release of the heart? It’s when a mendicant meditates determined on pervading the extent of a single tree root as expansive. This is called the expansive release of the heart. Also, a mendicant meditates determined on pervading the extent of two or three tree roots … a single village district … two or three village districts … a single kingdom … two or three kingdoms … this land surrounded by ocean. (…) “ 

Also, perhaps the following is a bit off topic, but I think it’s interesting to consider. 

The sutta then continues talking about how this pervasion and spreading results in different kinds of rebirths- among the company of gods of ‘limited radiance’,  ‘limitless radiance’, ‘pure radiance’ and, interestingly, among those of ‘corrupted radiance’ - apparently because of this; 
“Their physical discomfort is not completely settled, their dullness and drowsiness is not completely eradicated, and their restlessness and remorse is not completely eliminated. Because of this they practice absorption dimly, as it were.” 

Now, I don’t know how relevant it is to the practice of ultimate liberation to think about what kind of god one could become in a future birth. But I can’t help but wonder if those ‘forcefully practicing’ metta, in exclusion of ‘real practice’, may be on the path towards the gods of corrupted radiance..

Anyhow my question is- ‘spreading and radiating’ does seem to be a practice, and one which bears certain results, unless I’m misunderstanding something? 
I suppose that the friendly disposition which Venerable Nyanamoli described doesn’t exclude anything whatsoever, but it apparently lacks the ‘radiating’.

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/19f6kyr/spreading_a_heart_full_of_love/kjj891q/)** _2024-01-25 17:53:30:

    There's a few widespread distortions in translation to clear up:

    Firstly, *mettā* is not "love". "Love" is *pema,* and this needs to be ["abandoned, cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future. "](https://suttacentral.net/an4.200/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin)

    >Sorrow springs from love,

    >fear springs from love;

    >one free from love

    >has no sorrow, let alone fear.

    —Dhammapada 213 (interestingly, Ven. Sujato has chosen to translate *pema* as "attachment" here instead of questioning his rendering of mettā)

    "Loving-kindness" would thus be similarly incorrect for *mettā*. A *mittā* (like *kalyānamittā)* is a "friend", and from this, the word *mettā* is derived, hence we use the term "friendliness" instead. Friendliness is a natural, inherent quality of a liberated mind (just like compassion, contentment, and equanimity), whereas "love", a little or a lot,  is a defilement.

    Apart from that, there is another misleading alteration in every translation I've seen so far:

    >***...meditates spreading*** a \[mind\] full of \[friendliness\] to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth.

     ("abides pervading", or "keeps pervading" in other cases)

    But what the Pāli actually says is

    > "***...dwells/abides having pervaded/suffused (pharitvā viharati)*** with a mind of friendliness the first, second, third and fourth direction. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, he dwells having pervaded the whole world with a mind of friendliness—abundant, expansive, boundless, free of enmity and aversion.

    They might seem synonymous, but there is a crucial difference. The former implies you are actively engaging in this *process/activity* of spreading mettā, whereas the latter means you "passively" dwell *having* *established* a this attitude towards the whole world (and then, to insert the famous line from the Karaṇīyametta Sutta, you protect that *attitude* like a mother would protect her only child).

    The idea that it's a "process" is not accidental, and these two ways of practice are mutually exclusive since each implies a completely different notion of what the state of mind to be cultivated (and to be abandoned) is.

    The sole purpose of practicing *mettā*, which is the foundation upon which the next 3 are built, is to [abandon ill-will ](https://suttacentral.net/an6.13/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin), and ill-will towards other people or events arises when there is an *unpleasant feeling* in regard to them and the mind is untrained in regard to such feelings. It's an *additional layer* on top of the unpleasant feeling, of you resisting that feeling and wanting it to go away, because of which you then project the issue externally and start blaming the other person, wishing them harm, plotting revenge, etc.

    And how do you know that it's an "additional layer"? Because often a *friend* can come along and do something that makes you feel displeasure, but you never hate them or wish them harm. You calmly put up with the disturbance and maybe even laugh it off (a prank, for example). But if a person you already dislike does the same thing and causes you the same discomfort or inconvenience, you get angry in a fingersnap. This gives a clue as to what "friendliness" actually is, and the fact that literally everyone already has it with *some* people at least, without having to go around saying "may you be happy" and smiling whenever they think about them. The problem is that this friendliness is affected with *love* and delight in company almost always, but the ***liberation of mind*** through *mettā (mettā-cetovimutti*, the term always used in the Suttas) must be based upon [seclusion, dispassion, cessation, and result in relinquishment](https://suttacentral.net/sn46.54/en/bodhi?lang=en&reference=none&highlight=false), as well as being immeasurable and all-pervasive, without bias for some beings over others.

    And as soon as you start thinking about specific people to "radiate beams of loving-kindness" towards them, you *are* biasing them right then and there. If you were to receive news at that very moment that they were murdered, the degree to which went out of your way to cultivate that sort of attitude for that specific person would be the degree to which you would be averse to whoever killed them, not wishing *them* well *just as much* as the victim.

    >And how is hate born of love? It’s when someone likes, loves, and cares for a person. Others treat that person with disliking, loathing, and detestation. They think: ‘These others dislike the person I like.’ And so hate for them springs up. That’s how hate is born of love.

    —AN 4.200 (already linked above)

    Now, upon taking a closer look, it will become apparent that this process of "spreading loving-kindness" and repetition of cheesy phrases that people do in the name of mettā is not about abandoning the *resistance* to the displeasure that other people cause you—it's about *getting rid* of the displeasure and replacing it with pleasure instead, so that, by "cheating" as it were, ill-will no longer arises. 

    But ultimately you cheat nobody but yourself, because you're not actually *training* your mind so that it becomes imperturbable in every circumstance, however the aggregates happen to manifest; you're *fabricating* a new circumstance that will prevent your untrained mind from showing its true colors temporarily. And with "temporarily" I mean until the day you die at the latest, because many people who are very committed to this can certainly keep those states of mind going for a long time at least to a degree, until something that's far beyond their tolerance threshold comes up.

    But the thing is, even they would realize, if they just took a moment to reflect with unrelenting honesty, that if they *stopped* engaging in that contrived "kindness" practice that pastes this artificial pleasure over the natural displeasure of interaction with other beings, the ill-will would eventually come back. So in the end, what you'd be practicing with that is literally *control* of your feelings, *ownership*, not relinquishment, endurance and most importantly purification of *craving* in regard to them.

    And this leads to the next point where many people go wrong: the *brahmavihāras* in general are not "skillful fabrications"; they are one amongst many ways the Buddha taught for the *abandoning* of fabrications. What I'm referring to here is the notion many people have that "OK, yes, mettā is ultimately a fabrication, but I'll use this fabrication to abandon the other ones and eventually 'drop' it". But that's not how it works. As I alluded to above, mettā is an *inherent quality* of an undefiled mind, it's not something you "do". That quality will be there *on its own* as soon as you correctly abandon what's obstructing it, which is the resistance to displeasure—and ***that*** is the "fabrication" (*saṅkhāra* born of *avijjā).* Even the most untrained puthujjana *naturally* wishes every other being well for as long as they have no reason to rejoice in their harm, and that "reason", when it's there, is always this internal resistance (that is not accidental and one is solely responsible for maintaining and proliferating).

    So to return to the passage, one "*dwells having pervaded* the entire world with a mind of friendliness*" immediately,* not through the application of some sequential technique that you just "do" and which may or may not work, but through *understanding and clarity of discernment,* i.e., when one recognizes the *possibility* of displeasure arising, whether it's caused by other people or by inanimate things, and makes a determination not to resist it and act out of it, *while the unpleasant feeling remains*, because that was never the problem; the *craving against it* was. 

    (That's [not to say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0SJ_E8PPIs) that the mind will [listen ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLJhJDSwzhg)to that determination you make [immediately](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of11wtHjudY), however.)

    This is how you *know* beyond doubt that your mind is established in true mettā: you don't need to go around sugarcoating the bad things other people do in order to prevent ill-will from arising. You can confidently have two recognitions in your mind simultaneously: "this person is a complete idiot" and "I do not harbor the slightest bit of animosity towards him". This is what the Buddha displays all throughout the Suttas.

    >Now, I don’t know how relevant it is to the practice of ultimate liberation to think about what kind of god one could become in a future birth. But I can’t help but wonder if those ‘forcefully practicing’ metta, in exclusion of ‘real practice’, may be on the path towards the gods of corrupted radiance..

    No. Unfortunately, such people would not be on the path to any of these rebirths, not on account of such practices at least, because elevating the mind up to the level of these realms requires an immense and factual lessening of one's underlying tendency to *aversion*, as opposed to a skill, great as it may be, in *masking* aversion by replacing displeasure with pleasure.

    These are the same realms that would be reached by developing the second jhāna, depending on one's proficiency in it.

    Edit: You can't arrive at that "whole world", "immeasurable" level by simply adding up every part of it. That "whole" has to be discerned as *one phenomenon* and then the attitude directed towards *that* (See for an example of this the "others might attack that bhikkhu" passage in MN 28). The whole is not the sum if its parts in this case.

    >So you've made clear that whatever a worldling thinks metta is - most likely isn't, and whatever lofty things they try to do & achieve before having done the preliminary work of training and correctly discerning their mind-- just turns out wrong.

    Yes. If a person (today with the Buddha's instruction available) is getting very tangible results in terms of meditative bliss and such but still doesn't have the Right View, it's because whatever they're doing is not mettā. A person who is attaining (right) states of samādhi and wholesome joy cannot possibly *not* enter the stream if they're familiar with the Buddha's teaching, because reaching those states requires a more developed mind than sotāpatti does (it's the *last* and most refined component of the Noble Eightfold Path). Most lay disciples back in the day who were not anāgāmis would've died [without having attained](https://suttacentral.net/mn14/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin) what is generally conceived of as "meditative joy", whereas nowadays the whole picture is upside down.

    >But let's say that someone who is more developed, who has attained right view, who knows what is defiling them and what is not, and has uncovered metta as an *inherent quality* of their mind. Is there a ''practice of metta'' for such a person? Or are they already pervading, suffusing *''the world''* with it, so to speak?

    There is definitely work in this regard that ought to be done by a [trainee](https://suttacentral.net/an2.11-20/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin). That's when all these things discussed in the Suttas start to apply. The famous Mettā Sutta (Suttanipāta 1.8) in fact starts with, "*This is what should be done by one who is skilled in what's beneficial, and who has broken through to the path of peace*".

    All a noble disciple needs to "do" is refrain from resisting the *possibility* of unpleasant feeling born of contact with other beings, and that would be their practice of *mettā.* That possibility, when properly discerned, inherently applies to the whole world without, as I mentioned above, having to be concerned with this or that individual at all, be it to like them or to hate them. Regardless of whether it's someone from the first, second, third, or fourth quarter, the only way anyone can make you angry is by arousing displeasure in you, so if you have addressed *that* as a general possibility, you have addressed all the four quarters. It's about guarding the one "gateway" through which everything comes.

    This, for a noble disciple, eventually results in a "boundless mind", the "divine abiding" of mettā, one of the many forms of right samādhi (which has nothing at all to do with the common conception of sitting crossed legged in "concentration"):

    >I dwell having pervaded with a mind of friendliness the first, second, third, and fourth direction. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, I dwell having pervaded the whole world with a mind of friendliness—abundant, expansive, boundless, free of enmity and aversion.

    >\[...\]

    >As dwell like this, if I walk, at that time my walking is divine. … my standing is divine. … my sitting is divine. As dwell like this, if I lie down, at that time my lying is divine. This is the divine high and luxurious bed that I get these days when I want, without trouble or difficulty.”

    —AN 3.63

    And that divine abiding is a byproduct of the *continual absence* of the activity of aversion, not a result of the *continual maintenance* of the activity of "loving-kindness"—a subtle but big difference. To illustrate, the latter would be like reaching jhāna by *doing* pītisukha, which is impossible. That pītisukha is a *result* of the right effort of abandoning all passion for sensuality and the hindrances.

    >I'm confused why the Buddha would emphasize ''the entire world'' so often. 

    So that's why. There is a boundlessness, expansiveness, thoroughness and completeness that is not present *o*utside the attainment of that *liberation of mind* through mettā, even for a noble disciple (because samādhi is always only a temporary liberation). But as I alluded to above, it's pointless to explain the *practice* of mettā with its *result*, most importantly because nobody who is already familiar with the Dhamma has gotten nor will get to this point without reaching sotāpatti first (not to mention without fulfilling the foundation for it that they're already too happy to skip, i.e., the gradual training). 

    Moreover, if the final result is what's emphasized, many people might get the impression that we're talking about the same "state" that they've already experienced before just because from *their* perspective, the muddled absorption born of loving-kindness fabrication *seems* "boundless" and "expanded". But wrong view (the ignorance or outright misconception of what craving is, aversion in this case) cannot but [culminate in wrong samādhi,](https://suttacentral.net/sn45.1/en/bodhi?lang=en) and making much of that and getting the fruits of it results in [even further harm, not in benefit.](https://suttacentral.net/sn45.26/en/bodhi?lang=en&reference=none&highlight=false) To one who has no faculty of taste, a drink prepared with sea water is indistinguishable from a normal one, so they'll keep gleefully chugging it down to their own detriment.

    >Or as in the sutta I mentioned- through step by step enlarging it's range, with the help of visualizing tree roots, villages, kingdoms, etc.

    That's a different practice though. That's why it says that "these two things are different both in meaning and in phrasing". And it doesn't say "visualizing". It's pretty much exactly the opposite direction of that: widening the context of your mind (hence "expansive"), by recognizing that everything you're experiencing, even thoughts and "visualizations", is happening *within* that root of a tree, within that village, within that kingdom etc. Establishing the "right order" by putting that surrounding context first, and whatever is happening in your body and mind second (meaning you see one as the foundation for the other while both are present). It's not about other beings and your attitude towards them unlike the brahmavihāras.

    >and can ALSO actually indicate two actions CONCURRENT with one another: (the common (wrong?) translation you mention ) "One dwells SUFFUSING"...so whilst one meditates/dwells, one is also simultaneously pervading.

    >Another common example of that concurrency in absolutives found in Pali is "having dispelled all darkness, the sun shines". Which wouldn't literally mean the sun first removes the darkness and THEN shines. I've seen some even interpret the standard phrase "having abandoned the hindrances, he abides in jhana" in the same way - as in the abandoning being simultaneous with the jhana (something I find personally questionable, since this would render the "purification of mind" in the gradual training that preceeds Jhana useless).

    There would appear to be a discrepancy here because of the natural tendency (even for Pāli scholars) to think in terms of linear sequences of events operating through cause and effect instead of phenomenologically (simultaneous dependence). What people interpret as "concurrent" in these seemingly irregular scenarios of the absolutive—since they're trying to approach Pāli through the "worldview" of English—is in reality not really a concurrency, but one thing being subordinate to another *structurally* but not temporally. That is to say, the absolutive comes *always* structurally first but not necessarily first in *time*. Something can come later in time only if it comes second in structure ("the right order" often referred to in HH talks).

    To illustrate with the examples you mention, the constructions ("**vivicca** kāmehi **vivicca** akusalehi dhammehi ... *viharati*") and ("**pharitvā** *viharati*") are saying that the action/status in italics depends on the action in bold. And this is very different from "dwells suffusing" and "dwells abandoning", which would be two things happening side by side with a concurrency as you put it and not a mutual dependence, meaning you *could* stop suffusing and abandoning and "just dwell". But the dependence that is implied in the absolutive means that as soon as the "suffusion" or the "abandonment" go away, there will be no "dwelling" (at least not in *that* state). The present participle (pharanto viharati) is what actually implies concurrency, so that it's two actions that are mutually unrelated apart from the fact that they're happening simultaneously.

    This applies to the example of the sun you brought up too. The dispelling of darkness and the appearance of light are not two separate processes, and [the element of light is dependent on the element of darkness](https://suttacentral.net/sn14.11/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin), such that *phenomenologically,* in terms of the five aggregates, the presence of light ("the sun shines") is subordinate to the absence of darkness ("the sun having dispelled the darkness"). But ***science*** would probably say that darkness is just the absence of light *within the visible spectrum* and that ultimately there is no such thing as darkness. (And, not by coincidence, this is a perfect parallel to the subject at hand: the presence of mettā is in truth subordinate to the absence of aversion, whereas people see it as if aversion is the absence of loving-kindness, and thus fabricating loving kindness is the way to end aversion).

    So, simply put, phenomenology is implied in Pāli in ways that English lacks, which is not accidental due to *who* it was that complied these texts (Arahant monks), as well as the original spoken language upon which Pāli is based on belonging to the very group of people who understood the Dhamma so much more easily in comparison to us today.

    >However, even if we were to assume Bhante Anigha's translation as correct (having pervaded, one dwells) - that pervading is STILL something that would have to have happened at some point, be it in the past or in the present. If the metta meditation is simply dwelling after having established this attitude of metta, then what precisely is the establishment of the attitude of metta, if not the dwelling in it? How would one then establish that attitude, sans the suffusing and pervading?

    As I alluded to in the other reply to OP, it's the same principle as the first jhāna. Just as the attitude enabling the first jhāna is the giving up of sensuality, the attitude enabling the brahmavihāra of mettā is the giving up of aversion. Both are *abidings* that result from establishing the respective attitude (or rather, abandoning the respective wrong attitude) and sustaining that long enough.

    >Most usually things seem to be described in the Suttas in terms of negatives. .... non hate, non desire, non ill-will. But the word "metta" seems more of a positive thing (as opposed to abyāpāda,or even nekkhamma, for instance) , which may be why people interpret it as a fabricated thing. If metta was simply non-ill will, why call it "friendliness", and differentiate it from simple non-hate and non-aversion? Why make it a seperate thing?

    So the "positive" comes from sustaining the negative. Understanding what the negative is and how it comes about is the only thing that practically matters; the "positive" comes irrespective of one's preconceived ideas about what it is if one sustains the negative rightly (which, to repeat, is only practically possible with the Right View). Same again as with the first jhāna, or with Nibbāna for that matter. It makes no difference what you *expect* pītisukha born of separation to be or the peace of Nibbāna to be—what matters is that you cultivate the *basis* for them, i.e., total disenchantment with sensuality for the former and total absence of any passion, aversion, and muddledness towards anything at all for the latter. 

    To use the simile in AN 7.71, it's a futile distraction if the hen just *wishes* for her eggs to hatch safely (=the person literally *wishing* to have mettā by "radiating" affection to others); what truly helps at all is if she puts her wishing aside and  *sits on the eggs properly* (=the person focuses on abandoning the resistance to displeasure and nothing else).

    >Perhaps the entire destruction of lust, HATE, and delusion is only for the Buddha's noble disciples, but (I mentioned this in a comment in an HH vid which implied brahmaviharas require Right View) in the Suttas, there are plenty of examples of non-ariyas practicing the Brahmaviharas, meaning that metta is something on a different, simpler level than the destruction of hate and ill-will.

    Yes, but those non-ariyas had never heard the Dhamma (e.g. Sunetta in AN 7.66). If they did while having that degree of development, they would become not even sotāpannas, but anāgāmis, just as with the jhānas. They are able to "witness with the body" the cessation of a defilement, which even a sotāpanna cannot do, so the only thing stopping them from the Right View was not knowing that they should generalize that very principle to include *craving* in its entirety as well, which would've probably taken them a jiffy to do. To use the Buddha's simile, it's like someone were looking for heartwood, but due to sadly not knowing what heartwood actually looks like because nobody showed them, they would walk away with sapwood instead, while the heartwood was right there, ripe for the picking.

    Basically no one is even *able* to be in that position today. By the time they get even close, they'll have enough yoniso manasikāra so that, paired with the utterance of another that is nowadays available in excess with the Suttas, they will see the Dhamma.

    Edit: Also, there's one thing people would tend to forget which those non-ariyas did *before* they attained the liberation through mettā: they went forth. They were all renunciates, and Sunetta was free from sensuality. See what needs to be abandoned *before* mettā can be practiced in AN 8.63; the very thing without which the Buddha says Mahānāma wouldn't be a householder anymore in MN 14. If even lay *sotāpannas* didn't fulfill the precondition for succeeding in mettā, what is to be said of those today who aren't even that, and to boot aren't *at least* taking their virtue and restraint very seriously?

    >For the world to persist, it does not seem required that the body persists

    >The world at the very least *might* persist past the body, but hey, it seems to be pretty much always present throughout my life, so who is to say it won't continue... and boom, eternalism

    >But then in any case, there seems to be an immediate problem with 2), in that it assumes the persistence of the world outside of what we can know from within our senses / within the context of being subject to death and not knowing what exactly death entails. And then the 3) also is basically just an assumption that is unverifiable given our mortality.

    All this is exactly why the Right View is necessary to practice any of these "wider contexts" rightly. Before that point one *cannot help* but fall into the view that [things (will) exist or not](https://suttacentral.net/sn12.15/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin), eternalism or annihilationism.  One can abandon the ridiculous, coarse views of the self being eternal and infinite and so on, but deep down one of those two fundamental *attitudes* is perpetually there for a puthujjana, in the way that they implicitly regard their experience without even knowing.

    But with the Right View, there is no conceiving of an "outside world" anymore. That conceiving exists only as the counterpart to the assumption of the self "inside" that defines a puthujjana.

    So within that accurate phenomenological picture of everything being *within* the 6 sense base that a sotāpanna has understood and gained access to, there are things that are "here" and things that are "yonder". And the things that are "here" can be seen to depend on the things that are "yonder", or vice versa. So the body "here" can be seen to be dependent on the food, environment, etc. "yonder", and this would lead to dispassion toward the entire picture, or alternatively the *perception* of anything "yonder", such as food and the environment, can be seen to be dependent on the functional sense organs and body "here", which would equally lead to dispassion.

    When a puthujjana tries to see this, the "here" will inevitably involve the self in some tacit way that they can't see, and the "yonder" will imply the assumption of an "outside world". If those assumptions were even *seen* as they are, they wouldn't be there anymore, so they wouldn't be puthujjanas.

### Meditation in the gradual training presented in DN 2

I have a few questions about the gradual training presented in DN 2 and I hope to hear the answers from -- especially anyone from the Hermitage:

1. What kind of meditation is recommended?

2. How exactly the five hindrances are abandoned?

3. Is it possible for a lay person to follow this training?

Thank you in advance for reading and/or responding.

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/19dzb2w/meditation_in_the_gradual_training_presented_in/kjcwxhp/)** _2024-01-24 15:11:21:

    >What kind of meditation is recommended?

    Reflection on the benefits of renunciation and the danger of desire and aversion (MN 19, MN 106). Whenever the abandoning of hindrances is talked about in the Suttas, in DN 2 for example, it's reached by *reflecting* on the hindrances as unwanted and unbeneficial, until the reason for the hindrances being there (i.e., the lack of awareness of their true nature and the careless welcoming of them that follows as a matter of course) has been sufficiently worn out for the hindrances to *not* be there anymore.

    However, there is no way that one will mentally abandon the hindrances if physically and verbally one has not abandoned them, especially sensuality. And this is why virtue and sense restraint are a prerequisite for purification of mind in the Gradual Training. You'd be closer to freedom from hindrances by being virtuous and restrained than by practicing any contemplation on the basis of insufficient virtue, because it boils down to what the mind *values* deep down in the end, in the broadest scale of your entire life, not to what mental drills you go through in one particular sitting. 

    So a person who wasn't celibate before but now is, is *just on account of that* closer to the right meditation, because they couldn't possibly live that way by choice unless they, by a large margin, began to prefer renunciation over sensuality.

    >Is it possible for a lay person to follow this training?

    The Buddha is never seen teaching meditation or satipaṭṭhānas to laypeople in the Suttas (except once or twice to some who were already stream-enterers, and even then it wasn't satipaṭṭhānas but recollection of the Triple Gem). Not because they couldn't *try* to practice in the same way as monks, but because it wouldn't produce the kind of result that truly matters for as long as they didn't internally *c*herish renunciation enough to give up the very things that make them laypeople (which is not the clothes they wear, but the unrestrained behavior and pursuit of pleasure). And that's because, again, cherishing renunciation is the prerequisite for "success" in meditation, and laypeople in general are *afraid* of renunciation instead of cherishing it (AN 9.41). Meditation, as an advanced stage of the gradual training, is nothing but a further *cultivation* (*bhāvanā*) and refinement on a deeper level of the renunciation you already established. If you don't have it to begin with, what is there to cultivate and refine?

    >And then these three examples, which were neither supernaturally inspired, nor learned before in the past, occurred to me.

    Once renunciation is established externally, whether one lives in a house or in a monastery, it becomes a matter of learning how to contemplate rightly so that the mind can be internally purified too.

    >At Savatthī. “Bhikkhus, when one dwells contemplating gratification in things that can fetter, craving increases. With craving there is assumption; with assumption there is being; with being there is birth; with birth there is aging-and-death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair. Such is the origin of this whole mass of suffering.

    >“Suppose, bhikkhus, an oil lamp was burning in dependence on oil and a wick, and a man would pour oil into it and adjust the wick from time to time. Thus, sustained by that oil, fuelled by it, that oil lamp would burn for a very long time. So too, when one lives contemplating gratification in things that can fetter, craving increases…. Such is the origin of this whole mass of suffering.

    >“Bhikkhus, when one dwells contemplating danger in things that can fetter, craving ceases. With cessation of craving, cessation of assumption … cessation of birth … aging-and-death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair cease. Such is the cessation of this whole mass of suffering.

    >“Suppose, bhikkhus, an oil lamp was burning in dependence on oil and a wick, and the man would not pour oil into it or adjust the wick from time to time. Thus, when the former supply of fuel is exhausted, that oil lamp, not being fed with any more fuel, lacking sustenance, would be extinguished. So too, when one lives contemplating danger in things that can fetter, craving ceases…. Such is the cessation of this whole mass of suffering.”

    —SN 12.53

    >“Bhikkhus, just as this body, sustained by nutriment, subsists in dependence on nutriment and does not subsist without nutriment, so too the five hindrances, sustained by nutriment, subsist in dependence on nutriment and do not subsist without nutriment.

    >So it seems that the Satipaṭṭhānas were taught to Laypeople, although only mentioned a couple of times throughout the Suttas.

    Yes, shortly after I realized my statement was slightly off in the highlighted part:

    >The Buddha is never seen teaching meditation or satipaṭṭhānas to laypeople in the Suttas (except once or twice to some who were already stream-enterers, **and even then it wasn't satipaṭṭhānas but recollection of the Triple Gem).**

    I mainly had AN 11.11-12 in mind when I wrote this, but the 3 Suttas you mention do explicitly contain the satipaṭṭhānas. And there are others where they are implicitly there, such as SN 22.1 and MN 143.

    However, in all of these cases the laypeople in question were at least stream-enterers (and in SN 47.29-30 it's pretty clear that they were non-returners *before* they received Ven. Ānanda's instruction; you don't "become" a non-returner out of the blue like that).

    In MN 51 it's not explicitly stated, but there is this utterance from the Buddha regarding the person who said "we white-clothed lay people...":

    >“Mendicants, Pessa the elephant driver’s son is astute. He has great wisdom."

    The texts only show the Buddha making this statement with reference to eminent noble disciples like Ānanda, Sāriputta, Mahākaccāna, and the bhikkhunīs Dhammadinnā and Kajaṅgalikā, and the layman Pessa wouldn't be the exception.

    So the point still stands unchanged:

    >And that's because, again, cherishing renunciation is the prerequisite for "success" in meditation, and laypeople in general are *afraid* of renunciation instead of cherishing it 

    ...because someone like Pessa would never have gotten "great wisdom" (which means at least the Right View) and therefore gained the 4 satipaṭṭhānas if his mind didn't already value renunciation internally, even if *after* he became a sotāpanna he continued to live in sensuality. He didn't value it enough to strive further for non-return, but the fact that he became a noble disciple is testament that his mind was at least *sufficiently* inclined toward renunciation, in contrast to the vast majority of lay practitioners.

    >“Aggivessana, how is it possible that Prince Jayasena, living in the midst of sensual pleasures, enjoying sensual pleasures, being devoured by thoughts of sensual pleasures, being consumed by the fever of sensual pleasures, bent on the search for sensual pleasures, could know, see, or realise that which must be known through renunciation, seen through renunciation, attained through renunciation, realised through renunciation? That is impossible.

    >“Suppose, Aggivessana, there were two tamable elephants, horses, or oxen that were well tamed and well disciplined, and two tamable elephants, horses, or oxen that were untamed and undisciplined. What do you think, Aggivessana? Would the two tamable elephants, horses, or oxen that were well tamed and well disciplined, being tamed, acquire the behaviour of the tamed, would they arrive at the grade of the tamed?”—“Yes, venerable sir.”—“But would the two tamable elephants, horses, or oxen that were untamed and undisciplined, being untamed, acquire the behaviour of the tamed, would they arrive at the grade of the tamed, like the two tamable elephants, horses, or oxen that were well tamed and well disciplined?”—“No, venerable sir.”—“So too, Aggivessana, it is impossible that Prince Jayasena, living in the midst of sensual pleasures,…could know, see, or realise that which must be known through renunciation, seen through renunciation, attained through renunciation, realised through renunciation.

    >“Suppose, Aggivessana, there were a high mountain not far from a village or town, and two friends would leave the village or town and approach the mountain hand in hand. Having reached it, one friend would remain below at the foot of the mountain while the other would climb to the top. Then the friend who remained below at the foot of the mountain would say to the friend who stood on the top: ‘Well, friend, what do you see, standing on top of the mountain?’ And the other replied: ‘Standing on top of the mountain, friend, I see lovely parks, lovely groves, lovely meadows, and lovely ponds.’ Then the first friend would say: ‘It is impossible, [131] friend, it cannot happen that while standing on top of the mountain you should see lovely parks, lovely groves, lovely meadows, and lovely ponds.’

    >“Then the other friend would come down to the foot of the mountain, take his friend by the arm, and make him climb to the top of the mountain. After giving him a few moments to catch his breath, he would ask: ‘Well, friend, standing on top of the mountain, what do you see?’ And his friend would reply: ‘Standing on top of the mountain, friend, I see lovely parks, lovely groves, lovely meadows, and lovely ponds.’ Then the other would say: ‘Friend, just a little earlier we heard you say: “It is impossible, friend, it cannot happen that while standing on top of the mountain you should see lovely parks...lovely ponds.” But just now we heard you say: “Standing on top of the mountain, friend, I see lovely parks…lovely ponds.”’ Then the first friend would reply: ‘Because I was obstructed by this high mountain, friend, I did not see what was there to be seen.’

    >“So too, Aggivessana, Prince Jayasena is obstructed, hindered, blocked, and enveloped by a still greater mass than this—the mass of ignorance. Thus it is impossible that Prince Jayasena, living in the midst of sensual pleasures,…could know, see, or realise that which must be known through renunciation, seen through renunciation, attained through renunciation, realised through renunciation.

    —MN 125

    (See also the simile of the wet sticks in MN 36 I quoted above).

    The point is not that being a lay person is an obstacle, but that valuing sensual pleasures more than renunciation is.

### Contemplation to assist Sila


If I understand correctly, it seems that HH encourages that alongside keeping the precepts, one should also contemplate themes such as: why they are keeping the precepts, the value of the precepts, if they know what keeping the precepts has to do with the Dhamma, the danger of sensuality/peril in ill will, etc etc. 

Ajahn Nyanamoli said in one video ("Do You have Faith") that one still unestablished in virtue should be contemplating such themes constantly & frequently to help accomplish themselves in virtue, since it is due to lacking confidence in the VALUE of virtue that one then lacks faith in keeping their restraint. 

In "The Meaning of Right Samadhi" (starts at around 27:15 ) the "samadhi of virtue" is also discussed, in which it is said again that while keeping the virtue and sense restraint, one should also be contemplating the danger and the benefit of virtue/sense restraint. 

Now, all of this makes sense and is pretty reasonable - as one who restrains would have that very restraint as practical fodder for their contemplation (ex: using your experiences of restraining from sensuality to contemplate the background pain of desire that restraint reveals), and one who contemplates would have further reason to restrain in their daily life  (since you know WHY you do it). A kind of washing one hand cleans the other scenario. Through restraint, you see the value. Through seeing the value, you restrain. 

However, (and I finally get to my question) how exactly is this idea of frequent contemplation to help one's VIRTUE supported by the Suttas? There are indeed suttas where the Buddha says that through pursuing the INSIGHT of the DANGER in sensuality and BENEFIT of Renunciation, he attained and abided in the first Jhana, but where is something similar mentioned for mere virtue and sense restraint? Not including ofc, the Sotapanna's recollection of his virtue seen in the Suttas (bc the fact that a Sotapanna recollects his unblemished virtue probably doesn't mean that a puthujjhana unaccomplished in sila should be doing the same??).

The best I can find is this - 

》》And what, mendicants, is the power of reflection?
 It’s when someone reflects: "Bad conduct of body, speech, or mind has a bad, painful result in both this life and the next.’‘ Reflecting like this, they give up bad conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, and develop good conduct by way of body, speech, and mind" 


But even this seems to suggest a sort of contemplation-once-and-then-you're-done-and-now-your-sila-is-perfect-forever situation, not some sort of day-in-day-out contemplation practice. 

Virtue as shown in the context of the gradual training doesn't mention any sort of contemplation alongside it ("Come, bhikkhu, be possessed of morality..."), hence the reason for my doubt in this sort of practice. Virtue and precepts seem like something "simpler" to me (at least from my humble not-yet-accomplished in virtue perspective) - that should not need this sort of intense and frequent reflection and contemplation in order to be fulfilled.

    > There are indeed suttas where the Buddha says that through pursuing the INSIGHT of the DANGER in sensuality and BENEFIT of Renunciation, he attained and abided in the first Jhana, but where is something similar mentioned for mere virtue and sense restraint? 

    But in regard to what can that insight take place apart from the virtue and sense restraint that have been developed beforehand? How can you experientially recognize the benefit of something if you have never done it?

    >Before my enlightenment, while I was just a bodhisatta, not yet fully enlightened, it occurred to me too: ‘Good is renunciation, good is solitude.’ Yet my mind did not launch out upon renunciation and become placid, settled, and liberated in it, though I saw it as peaceful. It occurred to me: ‘Why is it that my mind does not launch out upon renunciation and become placid, settled, and liberated in it, though I see it as peaceful?’ Then it occurred to me: ‘I have not seen the danger in sensual pleasures and have not cultivated that; I have not achieved the benefit in renunciation and have not pursued it. Therefore my mind does not launch out upon renunciation and become placid, settled, and liberated in it, though I see it as peaceful.’

    —AN 9.41

    Since the very day the Buddha went forth, his adherence to the precepts was spotless, and yet here he's saying that still his mind was not becoming settled upon renunciation. This means his virtue was in place, but since he had not reflected upon the benefits of that virtue sufficiently in a way that would make his mind cease to *value* the things that he had given up through restrained behavior, he was unable to attain the *joy* of renunciation (i.e., samādhi, the first jhāna).

    So that's what the instruction to "reflect on the benefits of virtue", is pointing to, not that "*doing"* the virtue necessarily requires reflection. To the extent that the mind does not have samādhi,  it still does not *internally value* the virtue and sense restraint that have been established more than it values the pleasure that it has externally given up. There is external but not internal renunciation. And needless to say, it will be impossible to internally value and enjoy renunciation and consequently get samādhi while still externally being unvirtuous and unrestrained.

    There is nothing else that must be done to attain (right) samādhi apart from this, which is exactly what the Buddha did. Not to say that samādhi is *easy*: it'll probably take several years for most, and require the right view as well. But it's no more *complicated* than this, which is why the Suttas don't go into greater detail. ("Concentration" methods, on the other hand, are easy to get quick results from but convoluted in the end, since all this "patchwork" and supplemental techniques are necessary to deal with the situations where they don't work, plateaus, etc., and hence there's always more detail and information to add).

    >(bc the fact that a Sotapanna recollects his unblemished virtue probably doesn't mean that a puthujjhana unaccomplished in sila should be doing the same??).

    A sotāpanna who does that would be progressing further towards Arahantship; a puthujjana who does that properly (i.e. with yoniso manasikāra) would be purifying their mind from the obstacles that prevent them from getting the right view, so that:

    >...Then the Blessed One gave Sīha the general a progressive discourse, that is, a talk on giving, virtuous behavior, and heaven; ***he revealed the danger, degradation, and defilement of sensuality and the benefit of renunciation. When the Blessed One knew that Sīha’s mind was pliant, softened, rid of hindrances, uplifted, and confident,*** he revealed that Dhamma teaching special to the Buddhas: suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path. Then, just as a clean cloth rid of dark spots would readily absorb dye, so too, while Sīha the general sat in that same seat, there arose in him the dust-free, stainless Dhamma-eye: ‘Whatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessation.’

    Also, reflecting on virtue is not just for the sake of samādhi, but also to develop understanding as to what is wholesome and what is unwholesome. Understanding, by seeing it in one's own experience, how virtue and sense restraint are to be correctly practiced (internally, not in the sense of external observances) creates the basis for recognizing the Middle Way.

    For instance, all monks (at least in theory) keep exactly the same rules, but the lack of understanding of the *attitude/context* that makes virtue right often leads to the same precepts being taken as a form of self-mortification/denial of the world rather than the middle way. "Shunning the bait", to use the simile in MN 25. One doesn't need to be consciously trying to torture oneself to fall into that; all that's required is to not understand what wholesomeness is and why virtue is conducive to it, and one will automatically be running away from things rather than relinquishing them (and the techniques then come in to further the same wrong direction).

    That's why there's no such thing as even Right Speech, Right Action or Right Livelihood without Right View. Even when perfectly emulating every action the Buddha makes, a puthujjana's lack of direct knowledge of the nature of those actions and *why* they are beneficial would prevent them from being ultimately right *for them*. It would be *sīlabbataparāmāsa.*

    >his also applies to other discursive contemplations like "*my beating heart...*" that Ajahn Nyanamoli sometimes mentions. It was very interesting contemplation, but after few days I can't avoid repeating it like a mantra.

    >At what point should one stop?

    There isn't a point where one should "stop". If that contemplation (or literally any other found in the Suttas) has not resulted in purification from hindrances and sotāpatti, it's because something's off in one's way of doing it.

    When it becomes a mantra as you put it, it's because it's being done divorced from the present feeling/pressure, and is not actually addressing the defilements (even if they're not explicitly present, the *possibility* of defilements arising). It also means that the mind is now comfortable with one's level of restraint, so the way to make reflection not abstract anymore would be to tighten the renunciation, by working towards the eight precepts for example, gradually if one must, or for one who is already keeping the eight, seeing in what other ways they allow their mind to "rest" in worldly pleasures, even just mentally.

    Pulling the mind back from that will immediately, "experientially" reveal the extent of the mind's attachment to life (or , with another approach, delight and dependence on the sense bases), and the contemplation of how the beating heart undermines that life (or, impermanence of the sense organs) cannot but hit the nail on the head, so to speak.

    Even *thinking* about things that one *could* *be* attached or averse to if there isn't anything particularly sticking out at the moment should be enough to expose the mind's sensitivities, and it is there that any contemplation should be applied.  It should never be an unchanging observation or repetition of anything, neither a rudimentary object/sensation nor a more intricate discursive reflection, because the defilements never stay in the same "place" for you to conveniently be able to address them by doing the same thing over and over. That's the fundamental issue with meditation techniques and concentration: your mind wandering into a certain object could've been rooted in desire one time, and the next time you trying to keep it from wandering could be rooted in desire or another hindrance.

    Edit: [This talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfnlunP24iI) addresses this topic.

    >So one's contemplation should always be centered on the present defilement/pressure? For example, if there is aversion arisen in my experience, I should be contemplating on aversion and its nature (not on desire, for example)? And if there is desire present, the contenplation should be on investigating its danger? And perhaps if there is just a slight restlessness and a sense of "what exactly should I be doing/contemplating now??" - one contemplates on the phenomena of doubt?

    Broadly speaking yes, but the caveat is that you won't be able to catch when those defilements are there reliably in the beginning. You will inevitably be at times thinking that there is a desire you need to address when in reality the true driving force is the pressure of restlessness, and at other times you will be trying to avoid the restlessness but will as a result not be working diligently enough to abandon the desire. Or, if there isn't anything particular that the mind is preoccupied with, you might either fall into a muddled stupor or end up trying to take up some unnecessary mental activity out of restlessness.

    >“Bhikkhus, suppose a foolish, incompetent, unskilful cook were to present a king or a royal minister with various kinds of curries: sour, bitter, pungent, sweet, sharp, mild, salty, bland.

    >“That foolish, incompetent, unskilful cook does not gain gifts of clothing, wages, and bonuses. For what reason? Because that foolish, incompetent, unskilful cook does not pick up the hint of his own master’s preference.

    >“So too, bhikkhus, here some foolish, incompetent, unskilful bhikkhu dwells contemplating the body in the body, ardent, clearly comprehending, mindful, having removed covetousness and displeasure in regard to the world. While he dwells contemplating the body in the body, his mind does not become composed, his defilements are not abandoned, he does not pick up that sign. He dwells contemplating feelings in feelings … mind in mind … phenomena in phenomena, ardent, clearly comprehending, mindful, having removed covetousness and displeasure in regard to the world. While he dwells contemplating phenomena in phenomena, his mind does not become composed, his defilements are not abandoned, he does not pick up that hint.

    >“That foolish, incompetent, unskilful bhikkhu does not gain pleasant dwellings in this very life, nor does he gain mindfulness and clear comprehension. For what reason? Because, bhikkhus, that foolish, incompetent, unskilful bhikkhu does not pick up the hint of his own mind.

    —SN 47.8

    This means one cannot reliably know for oneself when the same contemplation (say, of the "beating heart" mentioned above) is purifying the mind rightly, because one does not see what the "dirt" is to begin with. So it remains a hit or miss, and for that reason the defilements will ultimately not be abandoned. They can never go away by luck or by accident.

    That's why grasping the sign of the mind is [indispensable for the Right View](https://suttacentral.net/an6.68/en/sujato?lang=en), and for the entire Noble Eightfold Path by extension. sammāsati is not just "doing" the four satipaṭṭhānas correctly in their *content,* in which case you *wouldn't* need to be a sotāpanna to meditate rightly; what makes it right is that one now knows clearly *(*or has "grasped the sign of") what and where craving actually is. Until then, one is just groping in the dark.

    So one just has to keep in mind that one *cannot* recognize the defilements fully and then work on improving *that*, until eventually grasping the sign of what craving in the utmost generality is and getting the Right View. As opposed to taking one's present ability to recognize unwholesome as unwholesome for granted and thinking it's just a matter of doing these contemplations now to address whatever one "guesstimates" the defilements are (like the foolish cook preparing the dishes *he thinks* the king will enjoy).

    (All this is what I was pointing to in [the latest essay](https://www.hillsidehermitage.org/the-nature-of-ignorance/)).

    >This seems to me like what is meant in the Bhaddekaratta Sutta about seeing every presently arisen state? One contemplates practically and concretely on the phenomena arisen HERE AND NOW.

    Correct. But that doesn't mean you try to block out the past and future and "just be here and now". Contrary to popular belief, your "here and now" is not just the "raw data" from the 5 senses like your bodily sensations (trying to have just that is like trying to reduce your mind into that of an animal, and conflating that with a pure mind). The "here and now" includes the entire situation of your five aggregates/six senses, so *anything* you might be thinking about, regardless of its particular content, is also part of that "here and now" that your contemplation is directed at. 

    The problem is when that's *overlooked.*

    So for example. if you catch yourself being worried about something that will happen in the future, instead of trying to *get rid* of that thought, which would ironically still entail craving for the future and against the present ("when will **this** \[which I'm bothered by\] go away?"), you set up the "right order" again and see that this thought is also within exactly the same "here and now" (the given situation of your 6 six sense base/body) that you have been  contemplating as liable to death, etc. 

    Counterintuitively, that's how you would be solely concerned with whatever is *already* present, as opposed to trying to have only *your* preconceived expectation of a "present moment"—longing for a phenomenon that you don't have and reinforcing the sense of ownership in the end.

### Question on Suffering as not self.

I don’t see with my own faculties how suffering is not self. It seems to me that the very nature of suffering is appropriation of form and impermanence against the grain of their qualities. Of the three marks, suffering is the most “personal.” It has to do with the person. Although, I’m sure there are impersonal, psychologically invisible forms of suffering going on under the hood. To see suffering as not self must be liberation and related to sottapannas and above. To see it directly. I think Volition has a similar issue. Does anyone know of resources that treat this topic in terms of practice or study?

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/19c6huv/question_on_suffering_as_not_self/kj0eap7/)** _2024-01-22 07:10:45:

    >To see suffering as not self must be liberation and related to sottapannas and above.

    Seeing suffering *at all* is liberation and is what defines a sotāpanna and above.

    What a puthujjana regards as suffering is necessarily superficial and mundane, insufficient to fit the bill of what the Four Noble Truths are about. So it's not like one starts out already seeing what *dukkha* is and then an extra step is necessary to turn that into *anattā.* Actually seeing suffering means seeing not-self right then and there, simultaneously.

    For as long as *sakkāyadiṭṭhi* is there, the suffering inherent in phenomena has not been recognized.

    >For one who sees in what way, Bhante, is personality-view abandoned?

    >Bhikkhu, for one who sees the eye as suffering, personality-view is abandoned. For one who sees forms as suffering, personality-view is abandoned. For one who sees eye-consciousness as suffering, personality-view is abandoned. For one who sees eye-contact as suffering, personality-view is abandoned ... for one who sees whatever feeling—pleasant, unpleasant or neither—that comes with mind-pressure as suffering, personality-view is abandoned.

    —SN 35.166

    So the way out of the problem is to not take one's current view of what suffering is for granted and then try to look for something else that's missing, but to realize and get oneself to thoroughly admit that it's that very view, right as it may appear,  that is the problem. Not doing that means starting off on the wrong foot—building on top of one's current understanding instead of demolishing the whole edifice which precisely makes one a puthujjana.

### Assuming Right View

Whenever I see that I am taking something for granted, it's obvious that that thing was not included within the aggregates for as long as I was taking it for granted. Now that it is recognized, it is automatically of the aggregates. Is this what Ajahn Nyanamoli means when I hear him say that assumption is not in the aggregates?

I ask, because I don't see how Right View could be anything but an assumption, because as soon as it is recognized it would necessarily be of the aggregates, subjected to change.

    >Whenever I see that I am taking something for granted, it's obvious that that thing was not included within the aggregates for as long as I was taking it for granted. Now that it is recognized, it is automatically of the aggregates. Is this what Ajahn Nyanamoli means when I hear him say that assumption is not in the aggregates?

    There is some validity in what you're referring to here. Assumption or upādāna always occurs because certain things are being gratuitously regarded as outside of the aggregates. But the thing is, precisely because things can *always* be recognized as primordially being within the aggregates that this is the "right order" of how things actually are. Meaning, it never could have *actually* been "outside", so it's not like "now that you recognized it" it became so.

    For example, giving in to sensuality can only be done by assuming the pressure or desire to act out as coming "first" and the experience of the pleasant object "second" (not "first" or "second" temporally, but in the sense of what is given *priority*). Thus,  the assumption of sensuality is eventually undone by seeing that no matter how much pressure there is to pursue some pleasant object, that pressure is *second* to the experience of the pleasant object which arose on its own (the aggregates); it cannot be there without it.

    So yes, in this case the one who is not free from sensuality will automatically experience that pressure as if it's "outside" of the aggregates, which is exactly why they will feel justified to act out of it. By repeatedly seeing that no matter how "outside" it feels, it still *has* to be within the aggregates, one is gradually restoring the right order, "wearing away" the assumption. And for this, one needs to be able to endure the pressure and not try to get rid of it, because craving against the discomfort of the pressure is precisely why the assumption (that there is an "outside" of it) is there ("with craving, assumption is").

    >I ask, because I don't see how Right View could be anything but an assumption, because as soon as it is recognized it would necessarily be of the aggregates, subjected to change.

    There is some truth to this as well, but not in the sense that you're suggesting. It's true in the sense that for a puthujjana, it's impossible to even *conceive* of a view that would be anything but another assumption—otherwise they would not be a puthujjana.

    But the Right View of sotāpanna is not a view in the way that a puthujjana knows views (which is always through their *diṭṭhi-upādāna*); it would be more correct to think that the Right View is the understanding of ***all*** views that makes assuming any view impossible. And that bears repeating: it's an *understanding* that makes one incapable of assuming views whether one tries to have views or not; it's not a *choice* of "I will not hold any views" or "I believe there is no self", because *that's* a view that one would assume in exactly the same manner as "the self is eternal", etc. They're different only in their *content*, , and that's all most people can see, not their nature of being assumed.

    Thus, not having the Right View means that *whatever* view one has will be wrong; it will still be affected with assumption. Wrong view is simply the lack of the Right View/sotapatti; it's not something you can "fix" by just adopting another view, even if its extracted verbatim from the Suttas. If it were like that, then indeed the Right View would just be another assumption, and also be subject to change as you say (you would lose it if you forgot everything you know about the Dhamma even in this life, whereas the true Right View survives for up to 7 wholly new births).

    >I hope I'm not coming across as an (annoying) broken record, but it seems that understanding/wisdom/discernment would have to be fully dependent upon that which is understood/discerned (how can there be understanding of that which I can't even fathom, unless of course we are making that-which-I-can't-even-fathom into a thing that we are fathoming, of course?). So the understanding of all views would have its roots in views being there in the first place. No views, no understanding of views. No understanding of views, no freedom from views. So even discerning nibbana requires the present absence of greed/lust/delusion, right? How can there be an unconditional freedom dependent on understanding that which is not there?

    That's right. It's never about gaining a vision of some rarefied truth, but about the understanding of the same things you have and always have had in your experience.

    And yes, if there were no things that could *serve as a basis* for passion, aversion, and delusion/muddledness in one's experience, there would be no way to distinguish what Nibbāna is. And most people's attempts at reaching Nibbāna consist of trying harder and harder to *suppress* those things that serve as a basis, so that the 3 defilements are thereby circumstantially sedated (and just to be sure, this is not even samatha practice either), ironically obstructing the possibility of Nibbāna.

    >One who has abandoned greed, 

    >is not greedy amidst that which incites greed.

    >Greed just slips off from him 

    >like water drops from a lotus.   

    
    >\[...\]  

    
    >One who has abandoned aversion, 

    >is not averse amidst that which incites aversion.

    >Aversion just slips off from him, 

    >like a palm nut from its stalk.  
      
    \[...\]  

    
    >One who has abandoned muddledness  
    is not muddled amidst that which incites muddledness.  
    He banishes all muddledness  
    As the sunrise dispels the dark.

    —Itivuttaka 3.39

    

    With this I don't mean one should go seek out experiences that incite the defilements, but that once one has withdrawn from those outwardly through virtue and sense restraint, the *possibility* of those experiences arising needs to be addressed internally so that whether they come or not, one becomes perfectly certain that they will *not* be able to arouse the defilements that they are a *basis* for (and that total certainty is what Nibbāna, or even samādhi but temporarily, is). It's impossible to understand and address those possibilities while they are actualities (hence you need to have practiced *before* you get sick, old, and die, or before you encounter pressuring things in order to have any chance of not being overwhelmed by them).

    >Maybe I can ask it like this: is the understanding that a chariot builder has of chariots, for example, the same understanding an arahant has of the way out of suffering (same understanding, different things being understood)?

    The Buddha once gave that simile alluding to how he'd be able to provide accurate answers even in his sleep, like a master chariot-builder who's questioned about his craft.

    But the crucial difference is that it must not be misconceived as *information* that one has accumulated. Even if you were to completely wipe an Arahant's memory, unlike the chariot builder, it wouldn't in the least bit affect his knowledge of the way out of suffering;  he'd only lose the tools he used to explain it to others.

    So I wouldn't really use that simile because for most people that's precisely the view they need to abandon: that the understanding of the Dhamma is just information and things they know from mere faith, tradition, learning or consideration, along the lines of "when it's like this you do that, and when it's like that you do this", abstract notions about liberation and "ultimate truth" that they find intellectually pleasing, "special" *sense perceptions* of irrelevant phenomena confused with knowledge of the three characteristics, or a mix between these.

    >Is the knowledge that I would lean away from painful experience/toward pleasurable experiences whether or not my memory was wiped on the same level of knowledge you are describing here?

    Ultimately there is nothing "on the same level" as that knowledge that a puthujjana can relate to. If anything, it's a noble disciple who would know that their mind can still lean towards or away from things, which is why in a next life they would never be able to overlook that they still have defilements if they were to ask themself that question, while a puthujjana can most certainly dupe themself into thinking that they *won't* crave for or against experiences, since they don't actually know what craving is even when they think they do.

    > Is it always crystal clear for the stream enterer that even though they may still have residual leanings toward pleasure/away from pain that there is an expiration date on those leanings?

    Not explicitly, but they are inherently incapable of regarding anything as permanent implicitly.

    >How would you describe that "turning point" for someone who has yet to discern it?

    The realization beyond all doubt that one can no longer suffer amidst suffering even if one tries and no matter how careless one gets, which doesn't depend at all on something you "learned" and could forget—or on some "practice" you do—but on suffering having arisen.

### How to make the best out of a dark retreat?

Hello everyone!

I just found this community and am very glad I did because I have been following the teachings of Ajahn Nyanamoli for quite some time (although I don't think I haven't made any bigger progress on the path of gradual training) and it's good to know there is so many other people benefiting from it!

I would like to ask for any opinion regarding a "dark retreat". This is basically provided as a stay in a completely dark (and almost completely silent) room with basic stuff like bed, shower and a toilet, and food being brought in once a day (unless you opt in for a fast).

I have very limited possibilities regarding periods of seclusion in my householder life and last month I found out about these retreats being available not far from where I live, so I went ahead and booked a 7-day stay in the second week of February.

I'm planning to use this valuable - albeit arguably extreme - opportunity to do the hard work of observing the unpleasant state of mind caused by a lack of sensory stimulation. Ajahn Nyanamoli often talks about the boredom and subsequent existential dread that sets in when there is no distraction available. I think this setting would be the ideal opportunity to get a taste of that.

I would be very happy for any feedback on this endeavor, especially the following points:

* Is it okay to go head in and try this form of seclusion? I do have some experience with periods of seclusion, but not for very long and not this extreme.
* Is there any particular topic/teaching to keep in mind during this time to make the best use of this retreat? My current hope is that the lack of sensual stimulation would allow me to reach more transparency/honesty to realize subtler motives behind sensory craving. I would like to pursue sensory restraint in my daily life in much higher degree, but it's easy to slide back into sensuality without a deeper understanding of its causes.

I am prepared for discomfort and willing to do the hard work during my stay but at the same time I would like to clear out any misunderstanding, such as this not being particularly conducive to the goal I set for myself or to Dhamma practice in general.

Any insight/advice is very welcome. Thank you.

    >Is it okay to go head in and try this form of seclusion? I do have some experience with periods of seclusion, but not for very long and not this extreme.

    If you haven't been developing virtue and sense restraint to an impeccable degree beforehand, then the extent to which you manage to keep your sanity throughout that experience is the extent to which you're not actually "secluded" in the true sense, meaning you're still finding some form of distraction on some level (which would include "the practice" when done with subtle motivations affected with craving). Wholesome mental development (as opposed to mental instability) on account of solitude is only possible when the Gradual Training has been well adhered to.

    A much more effective first step toward[ true seclusion ](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.63/en/bodhi?lang=en&reference=none&highlight=false)would be to address the shortcomings in your restraint that you're already aware of. Abandoning the ways in which you still delight in the pleasures that you encounter in your everyday life. That's what sense *restraint* is; sense *deprivation* is something else altogether, and the Buddha never encouraged that. Generally nowadays, "meditation" retreats and such are about the latter rather than the former, which is why the whole concept is utterly flawed.

    > Suppose there were a wet sappy piece of wood lying in water, and a man came with an upper fire-stick, thinking: ‘I shall light a fire, I shall produce heat.’ What do you think, Aggivessana? Could the man light a fire and produce heat by taking the upper fire-stick and rubbing it against the wet sappy piece of wood lying in the water?”

    >“No, Master Gotama. Why not? Because it is a wet sappy piece of wood, and it is lying in water. Eventually the man would reap only weariness and disappointment.”

    >“So too, Aggivessana, as to those recluses and brahmins who still do not live bodily withdrawn from sensual pleasures, and whose sensual desire, affection, infatuation, thirst, and fever for sensual pleasures has not been fully abandoned and suppressed internally, even if those good recluses and brahmins feel painful, racking, piercing feelings due to exertion, they are incapable of knowledge and vision and supreme enlightenment; and even if those good recluses and brahmins do not feel painful, racking, piercing feelings due to exertion, they are incapable of knowledge and vision and supreme enlightenment. This was the first simile that occurred to me spontaneously, never heard before.

    —MN 36

    If you put the sticks next to a bonfire for a few days to dry ASAP only to get them just as wet as they were before, it's basically as if you didn't do anything at all.

    >Is there any particular topic/teaching to keep in mind during this time to make the best use of this retreat? My current hope is that the lack of sensual stimulation would allow me to reach more transparency/honesty to realize subtler motives behind sensory craving. I would like to pursue sensory restraint in my daily life in much higher degree, but it's easy to slide back into sensuality without a deeper understanding of its causes.

    It's a common view that when this sort of thing is over with you'll have a greater understanding of your own mind, most popularly with the help of the mindless repetition of some meditation technique. But even if that's not involved at all, it's still a misunderstanding of how the "dust in one's eyes" that prevents one from recognizing one's craving is to be cleared up.

    The development of the mind can only take place when, to use an analogy, you were used to hiking with 5kg on your back and now you commit to carrying an extra 5-10kg ***every single day, 24/7*** ***with no "breaks" whatsoever,*** rather than when you take on 20kg for several hours only to go back to 5kg in the end.

    That is to say, you would become clearer about what craving is by taking on a greater but less extreme amount of renunciation but *for the rest of your life.* Becoming celibate, for example.

    If the thought of that scares you more than doing this retreat, it's a testament to how *that's* what would actually "hit the spot" and force you to face your true demons, whereas this superficially seemingly greater amount of renunciation is not really challenging the mind's attachments because it knows it will go back to the status quo at *some* point.

    > but there is still a lot of territory where I don't intuitively feel any danger in indulgence. I can force myself to deliberately perceive it as dangerous if I happen to have enough awareness at that moment, but I guess the goal is not to have to even think about it, is that correct?

    Yes, not having to think about it is how one knows that the true danger has been recognized (i.e. the mind is permanently free from sensuality), but that stage will never be reached if one doesn't make the effort to think about it.

    The danger in indulgence must to some extent be recognized on an external level and through reasoning initially, as discussed in MN 13. Seeing how, on account of being dependent on these pleasures, there is this whole delicate environmental setup that you need to work to protect and maintain, coupled with a perpetual possibility that something might go wrong and you will lose those things *while* you were dependent on them, causing you a great deal of suffering.

    Clarifying the danger intellectually on that level should be enough for one to start increasing one's withdrawal from sensuality to the point of the 8 precepts so that now one *lives* according to that intellectual perception of danger. It is only once the mind has become used to celibacy most of all that you would be able to "feel" the danger in sensuality on a less abstract level. You would start to sense in a very palpable way how, whenever a desire to break the virtue arises, the safety and degree of peace that you have been used to for some time is at risk.

    You would then be able to easily recognize desire as the sign of an incoming illness and thus as totally unwanted *because* you have been less ill (due to restraint in body and speech at least) and experienced that relief for a while, whereas, before that, you had no strong reference point since you had always have been equally sick (having not only mental desires but acting out of them on top of that).

    > I am able to gradually remove some of it - and later realize that it was completely unjustified in the first place 

    So this is how it always works. You will realize the true extent of its unsatisfactoriness and futility beyond the level of mere theory once you have been, on account of faith and reasoning, not engaging with it.

    You can see that as a symptom of the degree to which the danger of sensuality has not truly sunk in for the mind. It means the practice is still to some extent about consciously restraining (which you can only do when you're awake) rather than uprooting the delight.

    >This seems to say that well established virtue and sense restraint are necessary PRIOR to seclusion. However, I'm sure you can find quite a number of suttas that run along the lines of a certain bhikkhu requesting the Blessed One to instruct him so that he may dwell secluded, ardent, and resolute, and the Blessed One saying

    That's correct. However, we're not obliged to interpret that as meaning the monks who were given that instruction were cutting themselves off from all human contact for days on end, locking themselves to a single space, and fully dark to boot. In fact, not seeing people at all would largely be impossible as a monk back then, as they had to go on alms round daily (and a monk with less than 5 vassa shouldn't be away from a teacher/senior monk ideally; within that period they should already have the right view if they were actually and properly trying).

    The phrase "dwell secluded, ardent, and resolute" could simply mean that they ramped up their efforts (e.g., extra restraint regarding unnecessary speech, less engagement in duties, etc.) while living in a monastery like Jetavana where they would spend the majority of the day alone in their kuti or similar.

    In AN 10.99, the Buddha tells Upāli that one shouldn't frequent *remote lodgings in the forest* (strict solitude) until one has attained samādhi, but it's a given that one will never attain (right) samādhi without living "diligent, ardent, and resolute" to free the mind from sensuality and hindrances with less than full solitude (and without the right view of course). So when he tells him "stay with the Saṅgha", he's obviously not saying that socializing and delighting in the company of the other monks will somehow result in samadhi.

    In other words, physically distancing oneself from all interaction with spiritual companions is optional and should be done with care and preparation, ideally never without having attained the Noble Eightfold Path; minimal engagement with those who are *not* spiritual companions, not delighting in company, avoiding distractions, and restraining one's speech is [indispensable ](https://suttacentral.net/an6.68/en/sujato?lang=en)to even *attain* the path and should be done by everyone, as it is a primary facet of virtue. So by dwelling "diligent, ardent, and resolute" in this sense, one *would* be developing virtue.

    Then, on the basis of that virtue and the Right View (because the former properly developed should result in the latter), practicing the four satipaṭṭhānas would be possible (SN 47.15), be it in moderate or in extreme isolation.

    Quite often, desire for the latter (which would also include modern "intensive meditation retreats" even though you're not alone) is rooted in either fear and aversion to disturbances, or wrong views about enlightenment being reached by setting up the right environment where you can practice concentration (i.e. un-mindfulness) without any external factors to remind you of the place where suffering actually arises, both of which are obvious obstacles to the Right View.

    >I sense this is a dumb question, but this is where I am right now in my journey -- I am wondering how this is any different from taking on a diet or exercise regime, for example, and thinking,"I feel so much better, I'm going to do this for the rest of my life!" and a year later, you're back to being lazy and eating junk?

    It won't be very different from that if one doesn't get the Right View indeed. But at that point one will at least have a direct "feel" as to how non-virtue is suffering. By developing oneself further on the basis of that, to *understand* why non-virtue is suffering for example, one would get the Right View, and only then going back to non-virtue would be impossible.

    If one hasn't experienced the joy of virtue/renunciation for oneself, any contemplation of the danger in unwholesome behavior and what it is that makes it unwholesome will be abstract and thus insufficient to see the Four Noble Truths. It is in *this* sense that samādhi (that "joy of renunciation" which is a prelude to the first jhāna) is necessary for[ knowledge and vision to arise](https://suttacentral.net/an10.3/en/sujato), not in the sense of states of absorption, where the joy comes from something else.

    And that right type of joy[ is what enabled people to get the Right View](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/197fxsp/any_known_list_of_suttas_finishing_with_the/) in the Suttas every time.

    >So even though one may not reside physically distanced from others, staying alone in one's kuti as much as possible/most of the day + restraint of speech should be enough "seclusion" for the Right View?

    Well, depends what you mean with "physically distanced". In the best case scenario one *should* be away from others to a minimum degree—namely, free from the *possibility* of unexpected interaction and from even hearing  or feeling-like-one-might-hear the speech of others nearby, which automatically puts the mind in "social" mode (or never allows it to come off it in the first place).

    What I was referring to was more the idea of ["lone-dweller" (ekavihāri)](https://suttacentral.net/sn21.10/en/bodhi?lang=en), which is more like you don't see or talk to *anyone* for days or weeks on end, and don't live with other monks. That's what's referred to as "remote dwellings in the forest" in AN 10.99 and elsewhere. It's not explicitly stated, but reading between the lines it seems pretty clear that it was the exception rather than the rule (e.g., those monks were the ones who wouldn't have had an Uposatha meeting). It was one of the ways of "going the extra mile" like wearing only rag robes, eating only what's received during alms round, etc. Most monks probably lived more similarly to those in serious forest monasteries today, where you will inevitably be seeing each other daily for the meal and practical duties, while still having your own "empty hut".

    >Could you clarify what is meant here by spiritual companions, Bhante?

    >As in, anyone who happens to be in robes or claim interest in the Dhamma? Or as in people who seem to be those who might actually be able to help one progress on the Path? In which case, "physically distancing oneself from all interaction w spiritual companions " may not be that optional at all. One may just happen to live where there are no Ariyas around, to put it bluntly.

    It can go both ways. For example, the Buddha himself decreed that a junior bhikkhu can't be living without dependence (nissaya) on a teacher, even if that teacher is a complete puthujjana. There is genuine benefit in having to live with others in robes, especially if they're senior to one, despite disagreeing with their views and that they're not an example to follow when it comes to Dhamma and the training. For one thing, it reveals forms of conceit, obstinacy, and attachment to views that would otherwise go unnoticed, and it prevents you from falling for a distorted idea of "peace" that depends on things going the way you want.

    (But this only applies when one is living full-time in a community that keeps the 8 precepts. As a layperson in society, contact with other ordinary laypeople that are not even virtuous should be minimized, because even with a reclusive attitude one will, in most cases at least, *already* be rubbing elbows with others past the threshold where it's beneficial).

    In the other sense of "spiritual companion", for as long as one is a puthujjana at least, there is no benefit in cutting oneself off from one's source of Dhamma, including the Suttas (although one should certainly know where to stop, i.e., putting it aside when one's study and learning is starting to be rooted in restlessness, doubt, or pointless intellectual curiosity and satisfaction for example).

    >Why would modern intensive retreats be considered extreme isolation, Bhante - despite the crowds of people? Would it be due to the vows of silence, vows of not looking at anyone, vows of avoiding/lack of access to Dhamma material (books and so on) etc.?

    Well yes, strictly speaking it's not "isolation", and it's most certainly terrible in terms of seclusion. I meant it in the manner of "sense deprivation" and running away from things hoping that that's how enlightenment will be found, which is the same reason why some might choose to lock themselves in a cave for 3 months instead. Fundamentally it's the same sort of attitude.

    (Also, it's good to note that the Buddha *forbade* vows of silence for monks. It absolves you from doing the work of constantly discerning based on your background intention what is beneficial and unbeneficial speech, which ironically is infinitely closer to "mindfulness" than what you would do in such retreats).

### Pleasant enclosed within the unpleasant

I was listening to a talk earlier, and thinking and pondering about how it applies. But I thought it might be an interesting discussion point since a brief search didn't show up many exact results.

Am I considering things on the right track, *or* to what extent am I wrong:  
Whenever I am pressured by a thought, for example: '*there is this game I could play, that would be pleasant, it would be my escape from this other feeling'* the viewing of that idea, that thought as pleasant, and delighting in it *is* the gratification. The mechanism by which it is not seen as dangerous, is the failure to see that it is enclosed within the unpleasantness of the pressure, which is present at the same time. For me as a putthujana, there's already suffering there, at the same time. And the danger, is in the selective attention to the pleasant, and the delight, whereby passion is strengthened, and *things for me* is strengthened/maintained.

Keen to hear thoughts.

(2) If there were no danger in the world, beings would not become disenchanted with it; but because there is danger in the world, beings become disenchanted with it. (3) If there were no escape from the world, beings would not escape from it; but because there is an escape from the world, beings escape from it.

    —AN 3.105

    The pleasure derived from sensuality is real, and your renunciation will be imperfect (though still much preferrable to indulgence of course) if you try to deny that to stop yourself from wanting it. That's pretty much inevitable in the beginning, but one must be clear that that's still not the middle way.

    >and the danger, is in the selective attention to the pleasant, and the delight, whereby passion is strengthened, and *things for me* is strengthened/maintained.

    Sense pleasures are dangerous ***because*** they are so very delightful, plain and simple, not because such and such happens when you attend to it like this or like that. If your perception of danger depends on ceasing to acknowledge the agreeability of something, it's not anymore a sense *pleasure* whose nature you are recognizing.

    When the danger of sensuality is known on the right level, the more pleasant feelings something arouses, the sharper the perception of danger is, simultaneously and to the same extent. That's when there is no need to suppress or run away from any feelings that arise (apart from not breaking the precepts and basic sense restraint), because when sense pleasure suggests itself to the mind, no matter to what extent, it *brings with it* the recognition of danger, and that right there is the escape which requires you to "do" nothing whatsoever.

    And that is how you genuinely start to see *the same phenomenon* as a "charcoal pit", as a [very tasty but poisonous drink,](https://suttacentral.net/sn12.66/en/bodhi?lang=en&reference=none&highlight=false) instead of (inadvertently) altering the initial pleasure so that it's not *really* pleasure anymore.

    This is exactly why virtue and sense restraint are absolutely indispensable for this acute and liberating recognition to even be possible: if your behavior is not well purified way beforehand so that no matter how much pressure arises, you never act out of it, you won't be able to have the full extent of sensual gratification vis-à-vis without yielding to the actions it pushes you to make—and as soon as the pressure turns into action, any perception of its danger, let alone realization of the escape is impossible.

    Edit: There's a [talk ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ttVxzlzlj0)on this topic, and a [transcript](https://pathpress.org/not-wanting-the-wanting/).

    >To be clear the agreeability is obvious to me. I am not trying to deny that things are agreeable, or that there wouldn't remain agreeable aspects, but I guess my mistake was in trying to pay attention to other feelings that are also present, which is probably just replacement/management is it?

    It could be. There are essentially infinite ways for management to take place; ultimately it depends not on what you're attending to and how, but *why*. If you're trying to recognize that the arisen pleasure is enclosed within displeasure so that it ceases to be pleasant (which is something you'd need to keep an eye on; those little attitudes sneak in precisely because one overlooks them), that would be management. But if you recognize the suffering of desire while *enduring* the pressure of pleasure, it would be going in the right direction.

    >'Oh let me instead pay attention to an unpleasant feeling' and then rationalising it as a larger context of the same thing. But still just ends up being switching of the object of attention.

    Right, it shouldn't be "rationalizing". It should be such that if you were to completely forget everything you've learned and heard, you would still recognize "danger" whenever pleasure is there on account of a sense object, without even having to think about it. That's because you are *already* feeling the subtle but decidedly real "burn"  from the mere presence of the pleasant perception; if you need to be groping around on the level of ideas to find "why" it is *dukkha*, you are *ipso facto* overlooking where it is. The pain of sensuality is so "close" and immediate that one automatically looks past it, due to the beginningless habit of ignoring it and focusing on the secondary agreeability of objects.

    It is impossible to see the danger on the "right level" right off the bat, but by doing one's best, over time one realizes to what extent there was still a subtle degree of management in those attempts. Then one does the same with that "better" level, rinsing and repeating until the true right level is reached, and the actual assumption of sensuality as pleasant is permanently overcome.

    >So would it be correct to say that I've understood the right view at least to that extent, and now all I would need to do to further clarify and develop the path is more of the same, further refine the basis of sila, see the danger in the slightest fault, stop the habits of giving into distraction etc. in subtler ways and keep purifying the mind by the same principle until there is nothing left?

    >Sometimes I still get caught up in distractions, also because there seems to be this "resistance" as I wrote in my other comment. And there is also still this idea or habit that I have missed some extra information and I need to keep checking my understanding and get more information, re-listen to dhamma talks etc.

    >But maybe by now I should really stop getting lost in distractions and simply do more of the thing I have already understood, at least to that extent?

    This sounds like a more accurate understanding of the danger in sensuality, which is the only tool necessary to purify the mind from hindrances. The Right View must be kept separate from that, but of course the chief obstacle to not having it is still being submerged in the regarding of sensuality and craving as *not* suffering.

    So yes, you would need to start discerning the "bait" and how you "pick it up" in the context of any other hindrance, such as seeking information when it is clearly rooted in wanting to get rid of the discomfort of doubt, or giving in to distractions. Every other hindrance shares exactly that same principle: not being able to help taking one or another form of bait whenever it's presented, and the whole thing is overcome by enduring the pressure of the bait through nothing but the reflection on its danger and the repercussions of any engagement with it.

    One or another "bait" will always be there for as long as the senses/five aggregates exist; the difference is whether the mind has been trained to stay composed or if it still jumps at it eagerly.

### Any known list of suttas finishing with the arising of right view?

Hello, everyone! Does anyone know of a list/compilation of suttas in which the listener develops right view by the end of it?

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/197fxsp/any_known_list_of_suttas_finishing_with_the/ki35asn/)** _2024-01-16 05:45:12:

    [This](https://suttacentral.net/search?query=dhammacakkh) should show all instances.

    It wasn't part of the question, but it's a good opportunity to point out the following (which was the topic of [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2AWxZnxeYk)):

    It will become apparent that a specific pattern recurs throughout all of these instances

    >Then the Blessed One gave Sīha the general a progressive discourse, that is, a talk on giving, virtuous behavior, and heaven; ***he revealed the danger, degradation, and defilement of sensuality and the benefit of renunciation. When the Blessed One knew that Sīha’s mind was pliant, softened, rid of hindrances, uplifted, and confident,*** he revealed that Dhamma teaching special to the Buddhas: suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path. Then, just as a clean cloth rid of dark spots would readily absorb dye, so too, while Sīha the general sat in that same seat, there arose in him the dust-free, stainless Dhamma-eye: ‘Whatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessation.’

    What enabled these people to see the Four Noble Truths was *not* what is generally thought of as the forerunner of supramundane insight ("concentration"). It was a joyful state of mind on account of *dispassion for sensuality,* born of nothing but recognizing its inherent danger, and seeing its relinquishment as peaceful.

    &#x200B;

    >“Honorable Ānanda, we are laypeople who enjoy sensual pleasures. ***We like sensual pleasures, we love them and take joy in them. But renunciation seems like an abyss.*** I have heard that in this teaching and training there are very young mendicants whose minds are secure in renunciation; they’re confident, settled, and decided about it. They see it as peaceful. Renunciation is the dividing line between the multitude and the mendicants in this teaching and training.”  
    >  
    >\[...\]  
    >  
    >Before my awakening—when I was still unawakened but intent on awakening—I too thought, ‘Renunciation is good! Seclusion is good!’ ***But my mind wasn’t secure in renunciation; it wasn’t confident, settled, and decided about it. I didn’t see it as peaceful.*** Then I thought, ‘What is the cause, what is the reason why my mind isn’t secure in renunciation, and not confident, settled, and decided about it? Why don’t I see it as peaceful?’ Then I thought, ‘I haven’t seen the danger of sensual pleasures, and so I haven’t cultivated that. I haven’t realized the benefits of renunciation, and so I haven’t developed that. That’s why my mind isn’t secure in renunciation, and not confident, settled, and decided about it. And it’s why I don’t see it as peaceful.’ Then I thought, ‘Suppose that, seeing the drawbacks of sensual pleasures, I were to cultivate that. And suppose that, realizing the benefits of renunciation, I were to develop that. It’s possible that my mind would become secure in renunciation; it would be confident, settled, and decided about it. And I would see it as peaceful.’ And so, after some time, I saw the drawbacks of sensual pleasures and cultivated that, and I realized the benefits of renunciation and developed that. Then my mind became secure in renunciation; it was confident, settled, and decided about it. I saw it as peaceful.  
    >  
    >Quite separated from sense desires, separated from unbeneficial qualities, with thinking and with pondering, with joy and ease born of separation, I dwelt having entered the first jhāna.

    —AN 9.41

    This is a very different type of joy than that of sensuality, which is the same joy that comes from meditation for most people. **The joy of sensuality is self-contained**: it's pleasant because it's pleasant, period. Whether it's sexual intercourse, delicious food, or the blissful states that result from breath observation or any other techniques, both of them have in common that they simply "feel good".

    Contemporary meditation practices provide a source of pleasure that doesn't in itself demand renunciation. It is required only to the extent that the overt pursuit of worldly pleasures disrupts the sheltered setting necessary to craft the artificial mental space you want, which is what provides a temporary escape from suffering. From their point of view, sensuality must be abandoned because it's a "distraction" to this *other* pursuit, not because its intrinsic danger has been internalized; much like drugs and partying are easily forgone when you really want to focus on making money and "self-improvement" instead. And this is why, for those who enjoy sensual pleasures, this type of pleasure does *not* "seem like an abyss", and they juggle between their meditation practices and sensual engagements as if they're perfectly compatible—sometimes reinforcing each other, even.

    The pleasure of renunciation, on the other hand, is born of the *relief* of having given up something that was not for one's benefit (and thus it is inextricably tied with understanding things as they are). It is not pleasant ***because of*** ***itself*** unlike sensual pleasure, but because of a value judgment that determines what has been abandoned as absolutely undesirable ("good riddance"). This is exactly why this pleasure *begins* as pain: how it will be felt is solely determined by the current value judgment, which is in favor sensuality and the world by default.

    >"Forms, sounds, tastes, scents, bodily contacts and ideas which are agreeable, pleasant and charming, all these, while they last, are deemed to be happiness by the world with its devas. But when they cease, that is agreed by all to be unsatisfactory. By the Noble Ones, the cessation of ownership is seen as happiness. This is the reverse of the outlook of the whole world.

    —Suttanipāta 3.12

    The way to work towards this is joy of renunciation is, unsurprisingly, getting used to renunciation—virtue and sense restraint. The point must be reached where that which initially felt "like an abyss" as said in the Sutta above, is now a source of joy. The extent to which there are things that are "too dear to be given up", is the extent to which the mind is not confident in renunciation, and to which, to use the same simile, the cloth will not take the "dye" because it's soiled.

    >Firstly, a bhikkhu has not dispelled passion, desire, fondness, thirst, burning, and craving for sense pleasures. This being so, his mind doesn’t incline to ardency, dedication, persistence, and striving. This is the first shackle of mind he hasn’t cut off.  
    >  
    >\[...\]  
    >  
    >When a bhikkhu has not given up these five obstinacies and cut off these five shackles of mind, it’s impossible for him to achieve growth, improvement, or maturity in this teaching and training.

    —MN 16

    Laypeople back in the day did not have to go through this development because, as is clear from the texts, all it took for their minds to reach that pliable state was *hearing* about the danger of sensuality (this is what it means to have ["little dust in one's eyes")](https://suttacentral.net/sn6.1/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin). Their minds were thus able to regard renunciation as pleasant even though they were probably not even keeping the precepts before encountering the Buddha.

    Nowadays, on the other hand, when the giving up of worldly pleasures and attachments is talked about to most of us, let alone undertaken, the opposite of joy is the result. It is therefore necessary to *live out* renunciation as much as possible until ***that same*** "missing out" on things—which initially gave rise to anguish—becomes the greatest and only worthwhile source of happiness, independent of anything at all except continuing to "miss out", for if were to hinge on doing this or that \[practice\], it would just be another mundane pleasure.

    At that point, how the absence of craving is the ending of suffering is being experienced firsthand, and there is no way *not* to see the Four Noble Truths if one knows them intellectually—that's how knowledge would cease to be merely intellectual, not by having a "transcendental meditative experience that you can't put into words", of which there was never any mention whatsoever before stream entry in the Suttas, and there is no reason to believe that these people, like General Sīha in AN 8.12 or [King Bimbisāra and his ministers](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/brahmali?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=main&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin#22.1.1), very busy men, were engaging in what today is generally regarded as cultivation of the mind, let alone that it was what enabled their breakthrough.

    >it clearly shows that the people of that time were much closer to animals in their understanding of morality than any ordinary person from a modern more or less developed country.

    This is a common misunderstanding. "Morality" is relative and sometimes goes against the Dhamma; virtue is timeless and universal, and is always aligned with the principles of the Dhamma, which are non-greed and non-aversion. The Buddha stated that the baseline level of virtue in the world steadily decreases as time goes on, it never increases, and if one knows where to look, this is as obvious as it gets. Mundane advances on the other hand do and certainly have increased the baseline of morality across the world, which is irrelevant to the Dhamma. Morality is mostly based on herd mentality and peer pressure rather than individual responsibility, authenticity, and mundane right view, which are the foundation for wisdom.

    Besides, the fact that monks or nuns, and the ancient Indian populace in general, would have committed actions that go not only against "morality" but against virtue itself has little to do with what I'm referring to.

    —AN 5.142

    As the Buddha said, delusion is more blameworthy than greed. Delusion is in the views a person holds, in this case their unwillingness to see renunciation as worthwhile, and refusal to acknowledge that spiritual development and sensuality are mutually exclusive. There was, for example, the case of Sarakāni who was a stream-enterer addicted to alcohol; to some extent, unwholesome actions can be done despite right views being there. The difference is that there would always be a sense of compunction, whereas someone who doesn't see the danger of sensuality feels fully justified in their actions (which is most commonly the case today, and any suggestion that there *is* harm in those actions is met with  backlash).

    &#x200B;

    >In general, society held all kinds of philosophy and development of the mind in high esteem.

    That in itself is not significant, because as evidenced by the accounts in the Suttas, most of that philosophy was missing the mark by a longshot, so that's not what was contributing to there being less dust in the eyes of those people. It is *what* that philosophy was about, and the majority of the time it involved renunciation as a core tenet. The fact that people were even *open* to adopt that as an ideal on such a large scale—to the point where large numbers of ascetics could live purely on alms and be respected and admired, showing society's widespread support of those values—is evidence to how much less delusion they carried in this respect.

    In contrast, in modern times it is clear how even in other religions, as time goes on, less and less renunciation is expected from their adherents even on a very mild lay level, and those who still advocate it are regarded as "extremists" or "fundamentalists".

    >There was the Buddha as the supreme teacher who had the ability to know directly what to say, how to say it, and when to say it, so that the listener would have a chance to accept and understand the truth.  
    >  
    >There was the Buddha himself and all the many aryas whom he recognised as the unquestionable authorities and sources from whom one could hear the right view and be absolutely sure that it was the right view.

    This is no doubt a factor. But it actually serves to reinforce the argument rather than refute it: since there *isn't* a Buddha nowadays, there needs to be *even less* dust in one's eyes to stand a chance to  see the Four Noble Truths. Every bit to which even the thought of renunciation makes the mind afraid instead of peaceful is that much more of a liability.

    The cloth needs to be even cleaner because the expert dyer is no longer there.

    You're right, thanks for pointing that out. It must have been that very Sutta I was referencing from memory.

    Still, it's quite obvious that this is not the period of increase:

    >The ten ways of doing skillful deeds will totally disappear, and the ten ways of doing unskillful deeds will explode in popularity. Those people will not even have the word ‘skillful’, still less anyone who does what is skillful.  
    >  
    >And anyone who disrespects mother and father, ascetics and brahmins, and fails to honor the elders in the family will be venerated and praised, just as the opposite is venerated and praised today.

    There's no denying that we're closer to this than we were even 100 years ago, for example. And if we're taking the historicity of the Suttas as a given, back then a number of people managed to live up to 120 years (AN 3.52; SN 3.22; MN 91).

    >The very fact that the Buddha had to lay down rules against, for example, murder and theft shows that such rules were not widespread in society at that time. Today, people can live their whole lives and not only not become victims of brutal violence, but not even witness such crimes.

    But that doesn't have anything to do with people nowadays being more virtuous on average. Such crimes are not witnessed simply because laws are much more tightly enforced than back then, and punishment is harder to escape. It's virtually impossible to get away with murder now, whereas back then it was surely way easier.

    The greater amount of baseline virtue I'm referring to would be measured by how many people would kill, steal, lie, or commit adultery if they had a 100% guarantee of never being caught. This number has to be greater now than it was then.

    What people do or don't do per se is influenced by circumstances, and this is the level of morality. The virtuous person is the one who abstains from bad actions on account of *internal ideals* regardless of what everyone else does and whether there is a penalty or not. 

    Hence:

    >But not only have standards of morality become higher, crimes themselves, which used to be normal and natural and not always considered and condemned as crimes, have become rare. Doesn't that mean nothing from the point of view of the Dhamma?

    No. If anything, the fact that the societal standard of morality back then was poorer ***and yet*** there was a significant portion of society that upheld standards of good conduct out of their own free will (and often received more praise the higher those standards were) is precisely what would qualify them as more virtuous ("Others will be cruel/kill/lie, etc., but here we will not be cruel/kill/lie., etc." , MN 8). Again, modern people who wouldn't do the same under similar circumstances (including becoming the ascetics of other sects) are easier to find.

    I also seems like you might be exaggerating the severity and prevalence of those "crimes". I doubt they would've had the equivalent of our mass shootings.

    >So you mean that the mere fact that Buddha had to teach monks and nuns, for example, not to kill, says nothing about the degree of development of people at the time?

    All those who abstain from that today do so also because they were told, coupled with severe threats to boot.

    If a Buddha were to arise today for example, rules would've quite likely needed to be laid down from day 1 unlike then. In our time, his mere talking about craving and sensuality being the root of suffering, the aggregates being impermanent, etc. wouldn't have been enough for every newly ordained bhikkhu to behave like a renunciate well enough. The equivalent of Sudinna and thereby the first proclamation of a rule would've arisen much earlier (assuming he would reveal or admit to his offense at all).

    In addition, the crimes that are less prevalent today are not on the same level as the offenses monks committed. The Vinaya stories don't show monks becoming bandits and assaulting people on the street or becoming corrupt monarchs, but things like greed for requisites, unsuitable relations with women, and doing things that jeopardize communal harmony. None of which a modern person is any less likely to do if there were no rule forbidding it; quite the opposite if I had to guess.

    >In other words, the fact that the Buddha speaks to followers of other teachings in essentially the same terminological language, that they understand each other without the need to define every term and concept used ...

    It's not the intellectual understanding of the terminology that allows one to see the Dhamma, but the extent to which one can see what "the body is not yours " means in one's own experience, for example. Even if one accurately uses modern and relatable terminology to express the same thing, people nowadays are less likely to understand it in the way that actually frees the mind no matter how much it "makes sense" on the surface.

    >So the fact that people supported ascetics and teachers of a huge number of completely different, often completely opposite, views and values suggests that there was less delusion? Isn't that the case now? Isn't there the same widespread support for all kinds of religious cults and movements? So maybe it's not a question of the degree of delusion, otherwise people wouldn't support so many different cults, but simply of ordinary religiosity - of the very same ignorance and delusion?

    My point was about the fact that no matter how completely different those beliefs back then were, they often shared the relinquishment of the world as a core tenet, and more people were actually *doing* it. The amount of people who are ready to forgo pleasure and comfort in the name of their religion, *whatever* that may be, is lower today than it was back then (or even 100 years ago I'm willing to bet).

    There is ultimately delusion in whoever does not see the 4NT, but the prerequisite for seeing the Dhamma is a thorough internal acceptance that sensuality is suffering and renunciation is peaceful (the stepping stone to seeing the same with craving and non-craving in general). The lack of acceptance of this entails a much more obstructive kind of delusion than whether you pray to this deity or that deity, or perform this or that ritual every morning. The latter delusion can be given up simply through sound logic and reasoning; giving up the former delusion requires undoing one's mistaken but deeply rooted attitude towards existence and would take years to achieve.

    >But is virtue alone enough, no matter how perfect it is? Is the level of a person who strives to observe the five precepts and not to break them even in thought not enough to attain right view?

    It's not that keeping precepts is enough; the point is much more nuanced. The mind needs to feel peace at the thought of giving up everything that's dear to it (which is a nascent first jhāna, if you will). If that state is not already there, becoming accustomed to keeping precepts and celibacy *as the primary outlet for valuing renunciation*, not as a way of following some external code of conduct that such and such said is required, is the way to train toward it.

    >Because what we see here is that people are trying to wash the cloth without understanding where to stop and really start dyeing it, or they don't even know how and what colour to dye it, or they are trying to hide their ignorance and delusion on account of their real lack of knowledge and understanding of the Dhamma behind their immersion in the zeal of washing. Some, in their zeal, go so far as to wash the fabric down to the holes.

    Yes, that's because they're not actually renouncing things correctly. They're giving sensuality up with an underlying zeal to attain some other pleasure, and that's just as wrong—it's self mortification and denial, equally rooted in craving. So they need to become aware of that underlying defilement and do away with it in order for their attempts to do less harm than good. You can abandon all your family and possessions and go live under a bridge, but if there's desire for some other pleasure behind that, and an impulsive *aversion* as opposed to dispassion toward the things you gave up, that's not renunciation, and it's still a subtler form of desire.

    Things need to be given up because you see for yourself that sensuality is like a [poisonous drink with a heavenly taste](https://suttacentral.net/sn12.66/en/bodhi?lang=en). Not because the Buddha said so, or because you long and crave for enlightenment to be bestowed upon you in exchange for your house and family, nor because you *hate* sensuality now, which is what most people inadvertently fall into (the second deer herd in MN 25).

    >Is the reason why people who strive to observe at least five precepts and not to break them even in their thoughts have not yet attained the right views not that they lack virtue, not that their cloth is not clean enough, but that they simply either do not have the correct theoretical knowledge of the Dhamma or do not know how to actually apply it, that is, they do not know how and what colour to dye their already clean enough for now cloth?

    Well, there is a genuine possibility of having the wrong dye, which is when your views overtly contradict the Dhamma. But in those who have a reasonably accurate understanding of the Suttas that's not biased to justify some specific gimmicky technique— which seems to be the majority of people I've come across on this forum including those who choose to disagree—that wouldn't be the major obstacle.

    It's the extent to which they either  (1) feel the opposite of pleasure at just the *thought* of renunciation (2) are convinced that development of mind is about something else (which is often the byproduct of the first) or (3) value renunciation on the surface but with craving in fine print, meaning the hindrances of longing and restlessness are ultimately still there and not even seen.

    Lastly, the knowledge of the Dhamma is not something you "apply"; it's knowledge of the universal nature of any and all experiences that only becomes apparent when the mind is dispassionate towards the entire world, and even the next world (heavens) as the passages show (without having had to drift off into an imaginary different world to achieve that dispassion).

    This, not "concentration" in any shape or form, is what is to be understood when it's said that [without abandoning the five hindrances, supramundane understanding is not possible](https://suttacentral.net/an5.51/en/bodhi?lang=en&reference=none&highlight=false).

### Understanding not-self in not-self

After learning that the aggregates were there on their own for that sense of self to be there, I started thinking this body and this mind aren't mine, but rather that "I" is theirs.

But I also learned from Ajahn Nyanamoli that one should see "not-self in not self" and not "self in not self", and at the light of the Puṇṇamasutta or Mūlapariyāyasutta for example, I'm thinking what I expressed in the previous line might be wrong view also.

[Puṇṇamasutta SN 22.82:](https://suttacentral.net/sn22.82/en/bodhi)

>Here, bhikkhu, the uninstructed worldling, who is not a seer of the noble ones and is unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma, who is not a seer of superior persons and is unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma, regards form as self, or self as possessing form, or form as in self, or self as in form. He regards feeling as self … perception as self … volitional formations as self … consciousness as self, or self as possessing consciousness, or consciousness as in self, or self as in consciousness. That is how identity view comes to be.

[Mūlapariyāyasutta MN 1:](https://suttacentral.net/mn1/en/bodhi)

>He perceives the sensed as the sensed. Having perceived the sensed as the sensed, he conceives himself as the sensed, he conceives himself in the sensed, he conceives himself apart from the sensed, he conceives the sensed to be ‘mine,’ he delights in the sensed. Why is that? Because he has not fully understood it, I say.  
>  
>He perceives the cognized as the cognized. Having perceived the cognized as the cognized, he conceives himself as the cognized, he conceives himself in the cognized, he conceives himself apart from the cognized, he conceives the cognized to be ‘mine,’ he delights in the cognized. Why is that? Because he has not fully understood it, I say.

There is seeing "in not self" which are the aggregates that are their on their own, but then there also is a need to not see the I-element in this not-self, or otherwise it would be seeing self in not-self, it would be attavada, right? Even if this is only a sense of self?

So is it wrong to think that because there are those aggregates that were already there on their own, that's why this sense of self arose, in the sense that it is "generated" by those aggregates that come together and are "working" together? I feel like this is not seeing "self in \[aggregate\]" but rather "because aggregates, sense of self", or "self in the sensed/cognized" but rather "because sensed/cognized are there, sense of self is there".

    >It will be clear that when there is avijjā there is avijjā in both parts of our experience, the immediate and the reflexive; for though, in reflexion, experience is divided within itself, it is still one single, even if complex, structure. The effect of this may be seen from the Sabbāsavasutta (Majjhima i,2 <M.i,8>) wherein certain wrong views are spoken of. Three of them are: Attanā va attānam sañjānāmī ti; Attanā va anattānam sañjānāmī ti; and Anattanā va attānam sañjānāmī ti.

    >\[...\]  
    >  
    >Thus it will be seen that avijjā in reflexive experience (actual or potential) is the condition for avijjā in immediate experience.

And there is no reason in theory why we should stop here; ***but however far we go we shall not get beyond avijjā.***  
    >  
    >Avijjā is non-knowledge of the four noble truths. Sammāditthi is knowledge of the four noble truths. But sammāditthi is part of the four noble truths. Thus avijjā is non-knowledge of sammāditthi; that is to say, non-knowledge of knowledge of the four noble truths. But since sammāditthi, which is knowledge of the four noble truths, is part of the four noble truths, so avijjā is non-knowledge of knowledge of knowledge of the four noble truths. And so we can go on indefinitely. But the point to be noted is that each of these successive stages represents an additional layer of (potentially) reflexive avijjā. Non-knowledge of knowledge of the four noble truths is non-knowledge of vijjā, and non-knowledge of vijjā is failure to recognize avijjā as avijjā. Conversely, it is evident that when avijjā is ***once recognized anywhere in this structure it must vanish everywhere;*** for knowledge of the four noble truths entails knowledge of knowledge of the four noble truths, and vijjā ('science') replaces avijjā ('nescience') throughout.\[n\]

    >But I also learned from Ajahn Nyanamoli that one should see "not-self in not self" and not "self in not self"

    Therefore, it's not like one "should see not-self with not-self", as if it's a matter of choice. One needs to start by recognizing that one is by definition unable to do that until one is a sotāpanna. Acknowledging that is the only way to have a chance to see what "self" actually is.

    Otherwise, one is automatically taking one's present conception of the problem for granted, even if one is approaching it through the Suttas on paper. That means that whatever is seen to be "not-self" will still involve a subtler form of ownership that manages to elude one's insufficient threshold of recognition for what "self" is.

    The "regarding" and "conceiving" referred to in the Suttas you quoted are not at all something that can simply be figured out and then stopped. Rather, any attempt to figure out how to stop it is happening within the experience that is on some level regarded as self right then and there.

    The only direct choice one can make that could eventually make the sense of self apparent is that of not acting out of hindrances when they are recognized to be the motivation behind one's action, in this case the attempt to figure out the principle in question.

    >The application of the "wrong order" of things is an active (albeit subtle) ongoing activity, and if I'm understanding this correctly, the oft-mentioned "appropriation"/"ownership" that a puthujjana perpetrates, so to speak, is the act of "assuming" followed by "maintaining" that assumption from moment to moment that Bhikkhu Ninoslav Ñāṇamoli is talking about here.

    Yes, it is an "activity" in the sense that they're responsible for it, and that it can ultimately be brought to an end. But there is no way for them to just "stop it", for that would require them to be *aware* of the activity, and it's precisely because of their inability to even know its presence that the activity is there.

    Also, it's not like the assumption is being maintained "moment to moment", implying that you could "catch" it and temporarily be free from assumption. That's exactly why we translate it as "assumption" (which is also etymologically accurate) rather than "clinging". You can choose to not cling and then later on end up clinging to the same thing again, but the abandonment of an assumption is a permanent, one-shot deal.

    There cannot be a single instant, from the moment the puthujjana begins to practice the Dhamma up to when they become a sotāpanna, that the assumption of self was not present.

### Question regarding right and the wrong interpretations of mindfulness, according Nyanamoli.

I recently read *The only way to Jhana*, and found it really useful in order to further appreciate the whole teachings Buddha asked us to commit in order to attain right view.

So, I have been reading a bit about the interpretations of Nyanamoli on the suttas, specially on how  to practice meditation. It's quite clear that he regards most of nowadays Buddhism meditation techniques as not being aligned with Buddha's teaching for the main reason of not getting right what Buddha meant by mindfulness.

Yet, I fail to see the why such meditation techniques are wrong in their understanding mindfulness (according Nyanamoli view). From its Peripheral Awareness, we've got this description of right mindfulness

>We  need to stress that this is something that requires development. It’s  not something that can be just “figured out”, or read once and made  sense of. It requires a diligent repetition of "stepping back" when  over-attending one's experience as a whole. And then "stepping in" when  ignoring it (under-attending it, forgetting about the background). So,  it takes time and effort in order for it to be correctly discerned and  recognized.  
>  
>The problem with common  practice of meditation is that people are encouraged to get “absorbed”  into the particular “meditation object”. The practice becomes a form of  focusing on the foreground at the expense of everything else. And not  just that, people end up focusing on the objects twice as hard. This is  because their view of meditation is to look and perceive the “momentary”  foreground (the whole idea of "observing 'sensations'"). Then within  that they try to perceive even more particular things. So it’s not just  the  domain of the foreground, but the content proliferates further too.  In cases like this, the ‘background’, as a foundation of mindfulness  that needs to be understood, is even further obscured  
>  
>\[...\] this  type of mindfulness of the background that's simultaneous with the  presently arisen phenomenon, results in the establishment of mind.

For instance, in the anapana method taught by Goenka (my only experience with Buddhism-tagged meditation), one is asked to follow the breath and be aware of the touch of the breath in the area around the nostrils.

\[This meditation is not what it is described in the anapanasati sutta. Yet,\] In such meditation, isn't the breath the background/anchor we are asked not to lose sight of, while the particulars sensations of the breath is the foreground/arisen phenomenon we are asked to contemplate upon, while not reacting, not classifying them according our tastes, and so on.

Why such meditation (and other similars) are not the right mindfulness? As per my understanding, it fits into Nyanamoli right mindfulness definition and description. What I am missing?

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/196kehz/question_regarding_right_and_the_wrong/khxfvf1/)** _2024-01-15 05:26:40:

    >Why such meditation (and other similars) are not the right mindfulness? As per my understanding, it fits into Nyanamoli right mindfulness definition and description. What I am missing?

    &#x200B;

    Under that Buddha's own definition, meditation (bhāvanā), be it Anapanasati or anything else is the cultivation of the 7 enlightenment factors, and [these exist only for a stream-enterer.](https://suttacentral.net/sn46.30/en/sujato?lang=en)

    So in the end, the problem is not ***what*** a person is practicing per se. The point is not that if you do AN's "method" instead, you will be practicing properly. If only it were that easy.

    Meditation is the further development of the cessation of suffering that person has already understood. Thus, if they don't see the cessation of suffering, it follows that whatever meditation they're doing will be about something else (managing\*,\* running away from suffering, or getting a separate pleasure to cancel it out). Whether or not they regard it to be in line with the Four Noble Truths or not is not a valid criterion, because the point is that they haven't seen those truths yet to begin with. In fact, an attempt to cultivate the 7 enlightenment factors when one still hasn't understood what enlightenment entails taking one's current idea of what enlightenment and suffering are for granted.

    And that is really the issue. Anyone can do as many meditation techniques as they like, but for their own benefit, they shouldn't confuse that with the Buddha's teaching, because they will then not make the effort to find out what the Dhamma is. They will instead be obtaining various pleasant experiences and emotional reinforcement out of doing exactly what they've been doing before they took up the practice: seeking pleasure and shying away from displeasure. A noble disciple, on the other hand, meditates by *abandoning craving,* because they know and see what that is (and again, anyone can *think* that's what they're doing, but that's where self-honesty about one's level of development comes in; if one truly has understood what craving is, one should be able to not suffer regardless of whether one meditates or not, in any situation whatsoever).

    So what a person should do is not turn Ajahn Nyanamoli's instructions into another technique that they blindly follow, but strive to see for themselves what suffering is and the way out of it, and what wholesome is and why it is so, and what unwholesome is and why it is so. Only when that is seen internally beyond doubt is one able to abandon unwholesome states, which is what meditation is.

    >“There are, mendicants, these two powers. What two? The power of reflection and the power of development. And what, mendicants, is the power of reflection? It’s when someone reflects: ‘Bad conduct of body, speech, or mind has a bad, painful result in both this life and the next.’ Reflecting like this, they give up bad conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, and develop good conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, keeping themselves pure. This is called the power of reflection. *\[this is what a person can do, so as to eventually partake in the below:\]*  
    >  
    >**And what, mendicants, is the power of development (bhāvanā)? In this context, the power of development is the power of the trainees (sekha).** Relying on the power of a trainee, you give up greed, hate, and delusion. Having abandoned them, you don’t do anything unskillful, or practice anything bad. This is called the power of development. These are the two powers.”

    >***(next Sutta:)***  
    >  
    >\[...\] And what, mendicants, is the power of development? It’s when a mendicant develops the awakening factors of recollection, discernment of phenomena, effort, joy, calm, composure, and equanimity, which rely on seclusion, dispassion, and cessation, and ripen in relinquishment. This is called the power of development. These are the two powers.”

    Yes, I know my reply didn't directly answer the question. The thing is,

    >To really understand what to do with awareness and attention

    This is not the reason why one form of meditation is right and another is wrong. As I pointed out, it's not like if you direct your attention in "our" way instead of the others, you will be practicing right mindfulness. Without total self-honesty as to the motivation behind one's entire project of meditation, and without acknowledging that one's present understanding of things (with which any "way of attending" would be taken on) is precisely what's responsible for one's suffering, any instruction will be taken the wrong way, i.e. it will be just another one of the endless ways of trying to manage suffering. And that's why back in the Buddha's day there was no need to talk about "how" to direct one's attention; the level of self-honesty that they had, which is very rare nowadays, bypasses the need for any such instruction.

    If you strip Ajahn Nyanamoli's teachings from this intrinsic context, there is no fundamental difference between it and basically any other practice person might engage in, and that's when "what works for me" becomes the criterion. Whether one focuses on their nostrils or practices a more "open/peripheral awareness" is not an ultimately relevant distinction, and there is ample room for self-deception and stable maintenance of wrong view in both.

    Thus, the closest to an instruction that can be prescribed in an unqualified manner to any individual is to learn how to be aware of the [intentions behind any action](https://www.hillsidehermitage.org/intentions-behind-ones-actions/) whatsoever, big or small. Instead of trying to "be aware of the breath as a peripheral context instead of a foreground object", or anything else talked about in the Suttas, which can very well be done for wrong reasons, a person should become aware of the motivation behind them wanting to be aware of anything at all, and learn to see whether there is passion, aversion, or muddledness in that intention.

    To the extent that they can be aware of such inclinations, they will over time begin to recognize the true reason why they suffer, instead of performing this mindfulness or the other to lock the stable door after the horse was already stolen: deal with the suffering caused by the same unwholesome intentions that are being proliferated due to nothing but a [simple overlooking of their presence](https://www.hillsidehermitage.org/the-nature-of-ignorance/)—suffering that could've been *uprooted* instead of *managed* by recognizing those intentions and withdrawing from them from the very start.

    One would then not have to even *try* to be at peace by doing this or that, because the root of any possible disturbance is gone.

    Every single approach the Buddha taught, from the most rudimentary to the most refined states of samādhi, is about nothing other than recognizing intentions and abandoning them.

    >A side note, if you'll indulge me Bhante. I wonder if you can speak on the tendency now to translate lobha as passion?

    "Lobha, dosa, moha" is actually less frequent in the Pāli; most often it is "rāga, dosa, moha".

    "Lobha", which is "greed", does have courser connotations of material possessions and such, and the Buddha is by far not the only one to speak in favor of abandoning "greed". But the abandoning of \*rāga—\*for which "passion" is the literal translation, and which is much subtler and applies to the five aggregates in general (MN 109, *chandarāga* for the five aggregates)—takes way more than just "not being greedy".

### Moderation in eating

Wonder what everyone's thoughts on this matter are.  


As a non-monastic, who is keen to be virtuous. It has always struck me as a bit unnecessary that someone trying to keep 'eight' precepts at home should only eat before afternoon 'at the proper time'. Is there any functional reason why I couldn't obtain the same benefits having say lunch and dinner, or breakfast and dinner (but nothing in between)?  


It strikes me, that the timing is not all that important (in fact as a person living at home, I cannot see how it could be). But rather, the moderation aspect is what is important, and even more fundamentally, to not eat for pleasure. Then again, maybe I'm just trying to bargain with myself, because it is more convenient for me on some days to have an evening meal than a lunch, or because I do not have time for breakfast or a midday meal on some days.  


I fully admit, I don't understand what is correct here. So keen to get some advice.

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/196a1us/moderation_in_eating/khss3hl/)** _2024-01-14 10:33:06:

    >But rather, the moderation aspect is what is important, and even more fundamentally, to not eat for pleasure.

    Yes, that's it. The custom of eating in the morning was shaped mainly by the environmental circumstances of the early Saṅgha. There are some practical benefits of doing it that way though, such as not having to think about food for the rest of the day. There might be some physiological benefits to it as well.

    But ultimately, the most important thing is that at each meal is regarded as if it were one's only child on the plate, and the [sole purpose of eating it is to survive—no enjoyment sought from it whatsoever](https://suttacentral.net/sn12.63/en/bodhi?lang=en).

    That attitude is much easier to establish (and the wrong attitudes easier to pick up on) when one eats only once a day. All the potential desire and wrong reasons for eating get concentrated into one moment, and if they're there at all, it will be impossible not to see them.

    Of course, there is also the aspect of simply putting up with physical discomfort, although that's only part of the picture, and that can be done for wrong reasons too. Otherwise, all-out fasting would be the recommendation.

    >“Now, bhikkhus, suppose that I had eaten, refused more, had my fill, finished, had enough, had what I needed, and some alms-food was left over to be thrown away. Then two bhikkhus arrived hungry and weak, and I told them: ‘Bhikkhus, I have eaten, refused more… had what I needed, but there is this alms-food of mine left over to be thrown away; eat if you like; if you do not then I shall throw it now where there is no greenery or drop into water where there is no life’; then one bhikkhu thought: ‘The Blessed One has eaten, refused more… had what he needed, but there is this alms-food of the Blessed One left over to be thrown away; if we do not eat it the Blessed One will throw it away… but this has been said by the Blessed One: “Bhikkhus, be my heirs in Dhamma, not my heirs in material things”: now this alms-food is one of the material things; suppose that instead of eating this alms-food I pass the night and day hungry and weak?’ and instead of eating that alms-food he passed that night and day hungry and weak; then the second bhikkhu thought: ‘The Blessed One has eaten… had what he needed, but there is this alms-food of the Blessed One’s left over to be thrown away… Suppose that I eat this alms-food and pass the night and day neither hungry nor weak?’ And after eating that alms-food he passed the night and day not hungry and weak. Now although that bhikkhu by eating that alms-food passed the night and day neither hungry nor weak, yet the first bhikkhu is more to be respected and commended by me. Why is that? Because that will for long conduce to his fewness of wishes, contentment, effacement, easy support and arousal of energy.

    >Which seems to me to also be what craving (the pressure to act of what is felt) is, am I wrong?

    No—in fact, how both seem to be the synonymous shows that *paṭiccasamuppāda* is not a temporal "sequence". All of these "factors" are present altogether, standing in support of each other, and it is impossible—as long as there is ignorance—to have pressure present without there being craving to *act* on account of it too. Only a noble disciple can be in that situation, whereas for a puthujjana, the only way not to crave is for the pressure/feeling to not be there (by either preventing it from the start or by means of some management strategy that dampens the pressure; this is what meditation is about for most people, and even virtue and restraint when taken wrongly). That's where the recognition of "liability to suffering" comes in: you might have successfully dealt with the pressure *for now* through this or that "skillful means", but the fact that pressure can arise unannounced in the future entails that, for a puthujjana, craving will do so too, and thus suffering automatically.

    &#x200B;

    >Does that mean that when there is the sense of ownership, phassa entails cravings by default?

    Yes. If there *were* no craving to *act* out of the pressure, you couldn't call it "pressure" or even "contact" anymore. In order for it to qualify as "pressure" in the first place, there needs to be craving in response to it, on account of a misguided ownership of things that arise on their own (ignorance).

    So it goes both ways, pressure is determined as what it is by craving (which is always *already there*, 24/7; [it doesn't "arise" at some mysterious point](https://suttacentral.net/an10.62/en/bodhi?lang=en&reference=none&highlight=false)), and conversely, craving could never be there if there were no pressure.

### Reflection on my personal hypocrisy

Before officially leaving a large portion of the internet for solitude and contemplation, I wanted to do a reflection first and get some advice here if possible.

I was pretty disappointed with my behavior in one post. I felt that the debate was getting too heated and aggressive, and that it would be beneficial if we could just stick to the Dhamma, so I created a post requesting if it'd be possible for the individuals to resort to DMs. But a poster rightly mentioned it wasn't my place to police speech, and if I recall correctly, they told me to reflect on why I want others to stop. This was correct so I deleted the request. But it's thanks to that person that this entire reflection is possible.

The uncompromising stance on virtue by the entire HH community and videos has been immensely helpful to me at all times; when I'm keeping virtue and when I'm not. I always knew I could turn to this community or the videos to be fired up and motivated with regards to keeping virtue. But to the extent I was relying on this community, or in fact, *anything,* my virtue would be, to that very same extent, *liable to change*. It's almost as if 'true' virtue has to go *beyond* phenomena; at which point, there is no longer any *doing* of virtue, rather, just being housed in it. This is at least what it feels like for the 5 + celibacy; I'm not *doing* them at all, they're just a natural abiding where I *know* stepping out of would just be for my own harm, though of course not having the right view, the recognition of the extent of the harm is questionable.

In the debate on pedagogy, it was this uncompromising stance on virtue that was at risk that I wanted to protect. And I felt that that put my very own virtue at risk, which was one among the many reasons for creating the post I deleted. But I after the poster (sorry, I wish I remembered their tag) told me to reflect on why I was requesting that, I realized, this is essentially the opposite of this attitude on a more general level:

>*Not* depending on one's family for happiness, i.e., emotional abandonment of one's family, one *does not* expect them to *be* thus, *not be* thus; having abandoned any such expectations pertaining to change that are just expectations pertaining to things-in-the-world being in accordance to how one wants, there cannot be anger, there cannot *not* be gratitude towards one's family for what they've done

Except, this is "depending on this group for one's virtue" one wishes for things-in-the-world to be thus, or not be thus. To the extent that dependence remains, there is desire, there is the *possibility* of anger and ill-will on account of not getting what *I* want. And ill-will was definitely one of the possibilities that could've occurred here had the debate persisted; there was a general irritable state of mind as the debate wasn't coming to a stop. Not only does the six-sense based body, i.e., the world, need abandonment, but there also needs to be abandonment of the dependence of virtue on anything but itself.

But I noticed this is clearly me being the very thing I was accusing others of: a hypocrite. I don't take a particular issue with this since I've made it clear to myself from the start, before the Dhamma, of my hypocrisy in life in general, and my inability to get out of that. Undoing hypocrisy and contradiction on the level of actions and undoing it on the level of one's theoretical system or understanding of the Dhamma are two very clearly different things. I've admitted so many times: the totality of my being is a contradiction, a hypocrisy. But I just can't seem to *ever* get out of it.

I distinctly remember far before my encounter with the Dhamma the nights of genuine despair encountering with epistemological nihilism -- the fact that I can't seem to arrive at any definitive knowledge about anything, and its implication that my entire way of being and world-view is possibly a contradiction with what is or could be 'right', but is beyond my reach. That still remains. But with the addition of actual nihilism that has remained implicit in my way of interaction with the world since I started getting mental and physical problems.

Although virtue is being kept itself, I just came to these set of behaviors before my encounter with the Dhamma through seeing how much harm breaking it caused. I still have a permeating sense of meaninglessness that prevents me from undertaking more than 5+CL for longer than a month. Or rather, a more precise way to put it: the sense of meaninglessness is my excuse for not undertaking virtue further. But this sense of meaninglessness is actually itself a contradiction -- a contradiction that encourages further hypocrisy in me. Why can this meaninglessness not be applied to not keeping virtue? Why is it that *keeping* virtue is meaningless, whilst *not keeping* virtue *isn't* meaningless? Why is there selectiveness?

There's a *huge* arsenal of excuses I use to prevent further development in virtue. Another big one is the fact that this minute development that I *have* made through encountering the Dhamma has already made me significantly incapable of suffering amidst things that would previously drive me to seriously contemplating suicide: pure OCD, chronic health problems that still persist, disagreements with others, consistently being alone, etc. Generally speaking, I've never been happier than this in my life, and keeping virtue robs me of that happiness, and so I ask myself "do I *really* need to keep this when I've already developed myself enough"?

But then I see posts such as this (putting aside pedagogical concerns of such kinds of writing):

>Not taking the teaching with any level of personal seriousness, avoiding making any significant modifications to one's lifestyle and worldview is simply the perpetual delaying and putting off of the only truly effectual work. "I will put an end to ignorance and craving...tomorrow." But for the coward, tomorrow never comes. A coward either dies to their cowardice *today*, or they live forever in hell. 

And all of a sudden, all sense of meaninglessness ceases, all questions of "do I *really* need to develop more?" cease, and this coward suddenly has the motivation to undertake all the precepts. But this is not everlasting. This is still virtue dependent on *something*, and that *something* will eventually come to an end; so will virtue, if it remains on it.

How does this coward develop virtue *not* dependent on anything? Where is there cessation of the inherently contradictory nihilism used to justify putting back development in virtue? Where is there cessation of the hypocrisy and contradictory nature of this coward? 

I wish development in virtue were as simple as the press of a button -- I would press it immediately.

    >  
    >I wish development in virtue were as simple as the press of a button -- I would press it immediately.

    That struggle, though it may not seem like it, is exactly where the development of the mind takes place.

    Rather than trying to summon up a sense of "courage" that will make the virtue easy, which can only be done by holding on to an external motivation for keeping the virtue ("oral transmission, linage, testament, canonical authority, logic, inference, reasoned contemplation, acceptance of a view after consideration, the appearance of competence, or the attitude 'This is our teacher'"—AN 3.65), it's about not breaking the precepts despite the trepidation that arises. Only then are you learning to truly ["be an island unto yourself".](https://youtu.be/qJMDsnQ79Cc?si=KtEq5reqM_6dSXPG)

    Trying to *get rid* of the mind's apprehension to the training instead of being heedful *in spite of it* means "not enduring things on the right level".

    Thus, a true "coward" and "hypocrite" in the ultimate sense is one who is keen to suppress their (mental state of) cowardice because it's unpleasant, instead of seeing it as something that has arisen on its own and that they should allow to persist without acting out of it. It's still the appropriation of an arisen phenomenon in the end, and it's a good example of how one can easily drift into denial and [self-mortification](https://youtu.be/-039SYi2a94?si=jEQPru_-RqnQg05n&t=496) in a subtle way, which is the natural, equally ignorant knee-jerk response to the remorse that comes from indulgence. It's "hypocritical" because one is displaying heedfulness and a "sharp" sense of urgency *on the surface* while deep down all of it is rooted in still resisting displeasure on a subtler level.

    Virtue ceases to depend on anything when one understands as it is that the entire mind (including its unwillingness to keep the virtue) does not belong to one, and *that*, as opposed to having the mind the way one wants, is the cessation of suffering. And the way to that is to keep the virtue strictly while enduring whatever the mind feels. The former is certainly not easy, but it can be achieved by a lot of people (and for the wrong reasons too); the latter is where the true pitfall lies.

    >Yet this feeling of me as a person being negated and destroyed whenever anyone points out a mistake still persists.

    That's because the true "identity" (i.e., self view) is in the craving for displeasure not to be there, not in whether being proven wrong displeases you or not and how much. For as long as you expect displeasure not to arise or to cease (and pleasure to arise or continue), regardless of on account of *what*, you are liable to being "negated and destroyed" in the *true* sense.

    This passage essentially defines what qualifies as "early Buddhism" in HH teachings:

    >These books of the Pali Canon correctly represent the Buddha's Teaching, and can be regarded as trustworthy throughout. (Vinayapitaka:) Suttavibhanga, Mahāvagga, Cūlavagga; (Suttapitaka:) Dīghanikāya, Majjhimanikāya, Samyuttanikāya, Anguttaranikāya, Suttanipāta, Dhammapada, Udāna, Itivuttaka, Theratherīgāthā. (The Jātaka verses may be authentic, but they do not come within the scope of these Notes.) No other Pali books whatsoever should be taken as authoritative; and ignorance of them (and particularly of the traditional Commentaries) may be counted a positive advantage, as leaving less to be unlearned.

    —Notes on Dhamma, Ñāṇavīra Thera

    The list is widely agreed upon by modern scholars too. The Āgamas are also probably trustworthy, but the issue is there don't seem to be many English translations available, and the existing ones are likely to be biased. There is less room for scrutiny of translations compared to Pāli and its texts which have been studied extensively for over a hundred years.

### Craving for being and non-being

Hello, in [MN 9](https://suttacentral.net/mn9/en/bodhi) it is said:

>And what is the origin of suffering? It is craving, which brings renewal of being, is accompanied by delight and lust, and delights in this and that; that is, craving for sensual pleasures, craving for being, and craving for non-being. This is called the origin of suffering. 

Here, should one understand "craving for being, and craving for non-being" as only craving for *being* and *non-being*, or is it rather to be understood in the sense of craving for *being this*, or not *being that*, for example being smarter, or not being hypocritical?

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/193iqag/craving_for_being_and_nonbeing/khbswpb/)** _2024-01-11 06:09:05:

    For a mind that is not free from sensuality, wanting to be this or not wanting to be that, which many people might take *not* to be sensual craving but the other two, is accompanied by the same type of craving that would be there toward coarse sense pleasures. *Every* single experience they have is enveloped within that.

    On the other hand, for a mind that is free from sensuality, an intention-toward or intention-against the same things (excluding sexual intercourse and food) would be accompanied by craving for being or for non-being. For an Arahant, an intention-toward or intention-against the same things, excluding what is against celibacy and the precepts which they are incapable of, does not entail any craving at all.

    For example, even things like the wish for others to respect them and not despise them would come within sensuality for a puthujjana, whereas for an anāgāmi, that *same intention* would always be the subtler type of craving for being and non-being, which is why the suffering they would experience on account of that vastly subtler craving is practically nil. So it's not, as is widely viewed, that some intentions are *in themselves* sensual (apart from what is abandoned through the precepts) and some are the other two, and that as a puthujjana you can have either one or the other. That would be the quintessential mistake of placing the defilements in the experiences rather than the mind beneath them. The defiled mind of one still subject to sensual craving follows every experience like a wheel follows the ox's foot (Dhammapada 1).

    In the end, sensual craving is what *makes you human*. That's why the one who is free from that never returns to this world (the literal meaning of "anāgāmi").

    So instead of trying to abstractly conceive what the two other types of craving are, one must strive to abandon one's human way of existing (kāmabhava). One will then realize, *if* one is not an Arahant already, that there is a very refined form of non-indifference left, meaning craving for phenomena to be or not to be (or, alternatively, in terms of bhava instead of taṇhā, material being and immaterial being).

    Edit: Life and death, often taken to be being and non-being, are in themselves phenomena, so that's only one of the things an anāgāmi would crave for or against respectively (though every other desire would be subordinate to that). For a puthujjana, the desire to live and not die is necessarily a sensual desire, and thus they experience that much more anxiety in the face of death, and that much more suffering when death actually comes.

    >I think I still have a bad habit of understanding "sensuality" or "sensual pleasures" as "that of the flesh", or "of the five senses", but is what I'm missing : the fact that it includes the sixth sense that is encompassing craving towards anything of the flesh, and also anything of the mind

    Yes, that's the common mistake. Craving for sensual pleasure should not be confused with craving for *physical* pleasure, which is not so difficult to abandon by anyone who takes on the 8 precepts and then develops even a modicum of understanding as a puthujjana.

    >so basically craving towards anything that makes you human?

    What makes you human (i.e. a sensual being) is the *way* in which you crave in regard to phenomena, not specific phenomena you crave for. Apart from the craving for physical pleasure which is the coarsest level, sensual craving is more like an underlying context in regard to *anything,* and *that's* what makes you human. For example, it's the way in which you would care about what other people think about you—not the same way in which an anāgāmi would care, which causes almost no suffering in comparison (the other two types of craving). Or, again, the *way* in which you would crave to continue living and not die, all of which is due to the assumption of sensuality (kāmupādāna) that an anāgāmi is free from.

    One must stop acting toward specific things like the obvious physical pleasures, but that's only so that the actual craving at its root can be recognized, which is much more general and deeply rooted than any particular sensual objects you restrain yourself from.

### How to understand Ven. Ñānavīra on PS in light of SN 12.2?

Ven Ñānavīra has a unique interpretation of PS that has been very influential, especially in the HH teachings. He rejects that jāti in the PS formula refers to rebirth, as the Theravāda tradition has classically understood it, and instead asserts it simply means birth. He explains the implications of this in his “Notes on Dhamma,” writing:

“The puthujjana knows that people are born and die; and since he thinks 'my self exists' so he also thinks 'my self was born' and 'my self will die'. The puthujjana sees a 'self' to whom the words birth and death apply.[d] In contrast to the puthujjana, the arahat has altogether got rid of asmimāna (not to speak of attavāda—see MAMA), and does not even think 'I am'. This is bhavanirodha, cessation of being. And since he does not think 'I am' he also does not think 'I was born' or 'I shall die'. In other words, he sees no 'self' or even 'I' for the words birth and death to apply to.”

Thus, the cessation of these nidānā refer not to the cessation of literal birth and death, but rather the cessation of the attavāda which leads one to the view that they have a self which is subject to birth and death.

However, when we turn to the suttas, in the Paṭiccasamuppādavibhaṅgasutta we find a description of jāti and jarāmarana that seemingly describes quite literal birth, aging and death:

“And what, bhikkhus, is aging-and-death? The aging of the various beings in the various orders of beings, their growing old, brokenness of teeth, greyness of hair, wrinkling of skin, decline of vitality, degeneration of the faculties: this is called aging. The passing away of the various beings from the various orders of beings, their perishing, breakup, disappearance, mortality, death, completion of time, the breakup of the aggregates, the laying down of the carcass: this is called death. Thus this aging and this death are together called aging-and-death.

And what, bhikkhus, is birth? The birth of the various beings into the various orders of beings, their being born, descent into the womb, production, the manifestation of the aggregates, the obtaining of the sense bases. This is called birth.”

Vibhanga suttas such as this aim to definitively clarify the main terms of their subject. So, these descriptions should be viewed as quite significant and central to our understanding of PS. However, the seem difficult to rectify with Ven Ñānavīra’s interpretation of PS as they describe literal birth and death rather than the view of having a self which is susceptible to birth and death, as Ñānavīra claims.

I would greatly appreciate the help of those in this community who have greater knowledge and understanding of these matters than me in clarifying how to rectify these two texts. 

My thanks 🙏🙏🙏

    >Thus, the cessation of these nidānā refer not to the cessation of literal birth and death, but rather the cessation of the attavāda which leads one to the view that they have a self which is subject to birth and death.

    The starting point must be to not think that because this "makes sense", one is in a position to either accept or reject what Ñāṇavīra is describing. At the starting point of ignorance, when one hears the expression "cessation of the view that there is a self \[to whom birth and death apply\]", one is inevitably interpreting it through annihilationism (SN 12.15). It is impossible to even conceive what "cessation of self view" means without having understood *paṭiccasamuppāda* and having the Right View. For a puthujjana, cessation of attavāda is always necessarily misconceived as cessation of some kind of form, feeling, perception, intention, or consciousness, and never seen rightly as the cessation of *upādāna* regarding the aggregates (MN 109).

    &#x200B;

    >“But sir, is assumption (*upadāna)* the exact same thing as the five assumed aggregates? Or is assumption one thing and the five assumed aggregates another?”  
    >  
    >“Neither. Rather, the delight and passion for the five assumed aggregates is the assumption there.”

    —MN 109

    What this means is that it's more accurate as a puthujjana to think that the exact same birth and death one knows are still there when there is no self-view. But the free from self-view is not yoked, through their own misconceiving and ignorance, to that to which that same birth and death inevitably apply. Thus, they are not yoked to the suffering inherent in having been born and in dying, not that those things don't *exist* anymore or that they are now somehow pleasant.

    &#x200B;

    >If they feel a pleasant feeling, they feel it unyoked.  
    >  
    >If they feel an unpleasant feeling, they feel it unyoked.  
    >  
    >If they feel a neither-unpleasant-nor-pleasant feeling, they feel it unyoked.  
    >  
    >This is called a trained noble disciple who is unyoked from birth, old age, and death, from sorrows, lamentations, pains, dissatisfactions, and tribulations; who is unyoked from suffering, I say.

    —SN 36.6

    &#x200B;

    >Vibhanga suttas such as this aim to definitively clarify the main terms of their subject. So, these descriptions should be viewed as quite significant and central to our understanding of PS. However, the seem difficult to rectify with Ven Ñānavīra’s interpretation of PS as they describe literal birth and death rather than the view of having a self which is susceptible to birth and death, as Ñānavīra claims.

    They seem contradictory only when Ñāṇavīra's points are misinterpreted.

    Those passages are very well describing the phenomena of birth, aging, and death that a noble disciple is no longer subject to. Birth *is* the "descent into the womb, manifestation of the aggregates, etc.", and one who sees the Dhamma is not *subject* to that (is "unyoked" from it as above) even though their birth (together with it's inseparable liability to aging and death) is still there being *experienced.*

    And of course, they will experience even more births, agings, and deaths if they don't become an Arahant in this life. but none of that they are "yoked" to unlike the puthujjana who does have self view, who does wail and lament when the aggregates change in undesirable ways (SN 22.1).

    Ñāṇavīra's interpretation does not reject the wider context that applies across multiple lives—it *includes* it, and the application across multiple lives (which is still very different from the "three-life interpretation") remains secondary to the actual principle, which is independent of time.

    That is very different from saying that Ñāṇavīra's PS *only* applies to the present life like some sort of secular Buddhism, which is how it's often misapprehended.

### Where is the suffering

Scenario: 
I’m having a discussion with a person and they say something that upsets me. 
1. I am angry.
2. The interaction is displeasing.
3. I am suffering.

Questions:
1. Where is the anger? Where is the unpleasantness? Where is the suffering?
2. How would having Yoniso Manasikara not lead to some/all of these arising?

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/190sai4/where_is_the_suffering/kgwn9lv/)** _2024-01-08 15:36:16:

    1. Anger is a result of the underlying, unrecognized attitude of resistance against the unpleasantness of hearing something upsetting. Unpleasantness is in hearing something upsetting. Suffering is that very resistance against the unpleasantness (craving).

    Thus, resistance is what is on you; unpleasantness arises on its own when the senses experience certain things (*what* things specifically is irrelevant and will depend on the individual).

    &#x200B;

    2. An angry mental state is an indirect consequence of that which is on you (the resistance), so it should not be gotten rid of directly.  Instead, you need to discern how it is that you are resisting the displeasure, and how to "endure it on the right level" instead (this is yoniso manasikāra). Then the anger will be indirectly deprived of its fuel and eventually fade, while the unpleasantness remains.
- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/190sai4/where_is_the_suffering/khbzl7e/)** _2024-01-11 07:19:33 *(in reply to a comment not included)*:

    It means to refrain from trying to get rid of the unpleasant feeling that arose on its own when you heard something upsetting, but also not acting out of it—by retorting angrily, for example. Only then can the resistance be abandoned, and the anger which was a *consequence* of that resistance eventually fades. It cannot be directly dispelled because that would be rooted in the same resistance, just now against the displeasure of experiencing anger instead of the displeasure of the upsetting words.

    > Is it just a case of repeating this and eventually the anger will not arise, as I feel that I haven’t resisted’ the unpleasantness, but at some level I obviously have!

    No, it's not "just a case of repeating it" because one starts out by not even knowing or recognizing what the resistance is (not seeing the Four Noble Truths). Only a stream-enterer can "just repeat" what they already know.

    So the work really consists of dispelling one's wrong views about what that resistance/craving actually is and thus getting the Right View, not of just repeatedly cultivating what one presently thinks non-resistance is. It might make sense intellectually, but the very fact that there is still the issue of anger to any degree means non-resistance hasn't been understood on the right level. You can prevent yourself from acting out by body and speech as a matter of choice, but not acting out by mind is something much subtler that only comes with discernment, not volitionally.

### Giving into pressure

I am here to seek help. I have been listening to HH for past 4 years. And for the past year, I have been constantly giving into pressures. I give into pressure even when I am fully aware that I’m making a bad choices and hate my self when giving into them. This has made me realize that every-time pressure arise, which it will everyday, I will give into them. Due to this, I am self-loathing and thinking about ending myself. What could I do?

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/18ymn08/giving_into_pressure/kgg5ys6/)** _2024-01-05 16:13:22:

    It's important to be clear that true abandonment of unwholesome habits and not acting out of pressures *has* to be unpleasant because it essentially comes down to freeing oneself from the most deeply rooted addiction of all. An addict who does not experience withdrawal symptoms is necessarily still taking the same drug in one form or another.

    So instead of hoping to find a way for the undertaking of wholesome behavior not to be painful initially (which tends to be the reason behind the sense of "I can't do this"), it's about taking it on the pain to the degree that one can without being overwhelmed. If you still cannot keep the five precepts, you can work towards that goal one by one.

    Also, one has to recognize the previous careless choices that make one end up being overwhelmed with pressure in the first place. A person can never accidentally find themselves with a mind so full of lust that (it feels like) they cannot help but give in; it's always because, when the mind was not *as* lustful, they chose to go down a path where lust would increase. Restraining those easily ignored choices from the start would've been far less painful than restraining later once the mind has already gone far off the rails, which is when people usually care to remember the practice.
- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/18ymn08/giving_into_pressure/kgk11wx/)** _2024-01-06 07:19:34 *(in reply to a comment not included)*:

    The contradiction is because you seem to be interpreting "unwholesome habits" on a less fundamental level than what I was referring to. Ambition for instance is not on the same footing as passion, aversion, and delusion; it's one of the many possible *side effects* of those root defilements (which are what I meant with "unwholesome habits and acting out of pressures",  "habits" probably not being the best term in hindsight, as it has connotations of superficiality).

    A person who gives up their worldly ambitions upon recognizing how useless they are, if genuinely they don't feel any discomfort on account of it, either didn't actually have an addiction (passion/*rāga)* proper beneath that specific habit they gave up, or happens to still be carrying the same underlying defilement(s) but now in the form of some external motivation or ideal instead, in light of which such things are considered useless (e.g., their idea of the Dhamma and renunciation).

    That doesn't mean that one shouldn't give habits up unless the pain of withdrawal is felt because, in this example, continuing to proliferate one's worldly ambitions would further nourish the underlying defilements a lot more than clinging to (the right) virtue and duty, so the latter is undoubtedly the better alternative. But one should remember that until that withdrawal has been endured, the addiction—meaning the actual passion, aversion, and delusion; the tendency to act out of *pressure* in the most general sense—remains there, and only when that level is addressed is one truly purifying the mind instead of moving the problem to a better place, so to speak.

    What I was referring to ("endurance on the right level") is the only surefire way to abandon things, even superficial habits, let alone their roots, as ultimately one might not be able to re-direct one's passion to an external ideal or goal so much that the relinquishment of the old bad behaviors doesn't hurt anymore. That "assisted renunciation" should also not be encouraged, as it's already all too likely to happen anyway, and it's where the vast majority of people who have (duly) purified their behavior never manage to get out of (*sīlabbataparāmāsa*).

    (And of course, if one starts relishing the pain of withdrawal and romanticizing the whole thing, that also becomes another opportunity for the passion to just "move" instead of being truly abandoned. The "weight" is not being felt on the right level anymore; the right level is where you can't possibly delight in it, but you know the task that makes it be there has to be done all the same).

    >To take another non-physiological example: Someone might spend years battling a gambling addiction until — through the grace of some insight or instruction — they realize how much of their life has been wasted on this behavior. They likely knew that before, but on a purely intellectual level, the way a smoker “knows” that their habit is going to kill them someday. ***Once they apprehend that truth fully, though, it’s no longer just an intellectual understanding. They know it will kill them. And with that awareness, the behavior will correspondingly weaken its grip.*** (This approach to understanding is one of the most successful strategies in contemporary addiction psychology, but I recognize that such a claim may not be compelling in this context.)
     

     
    But what is it that would have made them "apprehend that truth fully"? That cannot happen just "through the grace of some insight or instruction" as you put it because it would imply that every addict is just missing some piece of information or advice that all those who have recovered were fortunate enough to obtain, which obviously cannot be the case. As you wrote, any (slightly self-honest) addict already "knows" that their habit brings more harm than good, so it's not really that they need to get a different kind of understanding that's "more than intellectual" (which is a contradiction).
     

     
    It's only if they at least *came to terms* with having to put up with the pain of relinquishment awaiting them that what they deep down already knew from the start would've "clicked". Their continued harmful behavior, in the case of someone who already acknowledged their predicament, could've only been enabled by "mental gymnastics" around the fact that the pain of not engaging in that behavior is not an excuse to continue engaging in it. Because of that impulse to shy away from the displeasure that they always took for granted, their already correct intellectual understanding was simply not applying "on the right level" (and that's what makes it "true" understanding, not its ceasing to be intellectual). That's why the ball is always in the addict's court, in the end, although having heard good advice doesn't hurt.
     

     

     
    >But with their newfound understanding of its nature, it seems to me that this choice needn’t be felt unpleasantly any longer.
     

     
    If they managed to stop resisting the pain of withdrawal having taken it on, then yes, the pain would've stopped "hurting" (unpleasant feeling can only be suffering for as long as there is aversion towards it). But if they never accepted that there *will* be pain and were still concerned with finding a way that to get cured without any discomfort, then the underlying problem is still there.

     
     
    >I can’t see how unpleasant endurance, on this level as you say, should be an *obligatory* component of renunciation
     

     
    Experiencing unpleasant feelings on account of rightly giving things up (that one was actually attached to) is obligatory; suffering on account of it is not (just as craving is not obligatory).

     
    It also depends on how we define "renunciation": if we take it to mean the undertaking of externally more restrained behavior then yes, that doesn't have to be unpleasant; the diminishing of *defilement*, on the other hand, always entails going "against the grain", even for a noble disciple).
     

     
    >I don’t have an opinion on whether complete renunciation of craving, aversion, and delusion requires unpleasant endurance. At that ultimate level, I’m willing to take your word for it. But I have to assume your advice here — especially to people like OP, who are struggling with very coarse, mundane compulsions — isn’t intended for anāgāmis.
     

     
    That "ultimate level" is actually not just for anāgāmis. It's for everyone who wants to develop their mind so as to be at peace regardless of circumstances, as opposed to just having better circumstances. That can only be achieved by decreasing defilements as opposed to re-directing them to, as I said above, an external ideal or goal ("religion", which applies to even the purest Dhamma just as well; whoever has *sīlabbataparāmāsa* is still "religious" by necessity).
     

     
    Now, in the case of whether such advice is appropriate in OP's case, this is an example of how the Dhamma has to be at least *conveyed* so that it's (equally) good in the beginning, middle, and end. As in, it is a disservice to give advice that *aims* at less than the ultimate even to a total beginner. It's not like there is "casual Dhamma" and "hardcore Dhamma", as many probably believe. When the Dhamma is morphed so as to be more appealing to those who are less committed, it ceases to be the Dhamma. So what one has to do is show them the "real" thing, and then they decide to what extent they want to take it on, if at all, and when. Knowingly failing to convey that is what would be truly inconsiderate on one's part.
     

     
    There is no shortage of teachings that are not in accordance with the Dhamma, so if that's what a person is looking for, it should not be difficult to find it (and they would not be open to anything else anyway if they're truly satisfied with that). At some point, even that person might at least turn back and decide to try what they initially dismissed, which they wouldn't do if it was portrayed in a more "palatable" manner that makes it blend in with the rest.
     

     

     
    >I can’t see any evidence in the suttas or personal experience to indicate that renunciation of even serious compulsions, let alone superficial habits as you mentioned, need be experienced this way (particularly for someone post-sotāpatti, but even for others just approaching the Dhamma). It feels like a profoundly dour view of a path which has otherwise been described as good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end.
     

     
    What is "good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end" is the *Dhamma*, as the Suttas say. Meaning, "goodness" begins when the person gets the Right View (begins to partake in the Dhamma having seen it) and thus learns how to not crave against the discomfort of restraint, for example, making the pain of the practice not be suffering anymore. But it is not said at least in the Suttas that the *practice in general* has to be "good" in the beginning (if we interpret that to mean "pleasant"; of course it is always "good" in the sense of being for one's welfare, it's just that those two tend not to go hand in hand).

     
    Also, see AN 10.217 on how there is no way to put an end to accumulated kamma, nor to suffering in general, without experiencing its results ("results" meaning the pain of renunciation, not external unpleasant events).
     
    >I appreciate all of the rigor this community has to offer. It’s refreshing. But I can’t help but feel these messages are unusually focused on negativity, in a way that doesn’t seem to characterize the Buddha’s own instructions.
     

     
    I know what you mean, and I don't doubt that here there is genuine negativity underneath sometimes, as there is ample room for misinterpretation of the teaching. But apart from that, it shouldn't be forgotten that the "perversion of perception" is the starting point, meaning that what would be pleasant with the right set of eyes is bound to be seen as suffering (negativity), and vice versa.
     

     
    >"Forms, sounds, tastes, scents, bodily contacts and ideas which are agreeable, pleasant and charming, all these, while they last, are deemed to be happiness by the world with its gods. But wherein they cease—that is agreed by them all to be suffering. By the Noble Ones, the cessation of personality is seen as happiness. This is the reverse of the outlook of the whole world.
     

     
    >"What others call happiness, that the Noble Ones declare to be suffering. What others call suffering, that the Noble Ones have found to be happiness. See how difficult it is to understand the Dhamma! ...
     

     
    —Snp 3.12
     

     
    Lastly, just to be clear, I'm not saying people should only give things up when doing so is unpleasant. By all means, a person should give up all the coarse bad habits they can even if there's some underlying (religious) motivation behind it, as that makes for a more pleasant life. It's just that they should keep in mind that at some point, if they hope to truly purify their mind (including even the rare case of getting jhānas as a puthujjana), they will have to come face to face with the actual underlying tendencies without the aid of their "religion" (i.e., external ideal or motivation for practice which still goes "with the grain" of the underlying tendencies), and that cannot be pleasant (not that it's this insufferable angst, misery and gritting of teeth always; just that there will be at least *some* dissonance involved that must be endured, increasingly subtle as the mind develops, when the defilements are truly wearing away).

    >In SN 12.2 Thanissaro has "From feeling as a requisite condition \*\*\*comes \*\*\* craving."

    Right, translators almost always present it as a "sequence" which is unjustified (see SN 12.67 where Sāriputta compares it to two sticks standing in dependence on each other). The view of it being a sequential process allows one (to one's own detriment) to think that one can "stop" it momentarily somehow, whereas the only way is to abolish ignorance by getting the Right View once and for all. For as long as that hasn't occurred, all these factors are *already there* all at once, always, because ignorance is and has always been there, with no first point of manifestation (AN 10.61).

    &#x200B;

    >Does it mean that there is a second, unmentioned, requisite condition that in an arahant is absent? Or does it mean that the "feeling" of an arahant is not the "feeling" of a puthujjana?

    Both, in a sense. The absent requisite condition is, in the most obvious textbook answer, ignorance, without which *paṭiccasamuppāda* no longer applies. At the same time, an Arahant no longer has the five *assumed* aggregates (*pañcupādānakkhanda*) but simply the five aggregates (*pañcakkhanda)*. The assumption (*upādāna*) the puthujjana is enveloped in adds an extra dimension to every feeling that arises for them (the second arrow, SN 36.6). So one cannot categorically say that it's the same feeling or that it's a different one, because neither of those ways of thinking about it would do anything to solve the ignorance/assumption which is the root of the puthujjana's problem: believing it's the same feeling would make them undershoot the mark; believing it's a different one would make them overshoot it.

    Also, since a sotāpanna has understood the nature of assumption, they would also experience unpleasant feelings on account of renunciation, but without suffering on account of them.

### Is there a comprehensive guide or system of the gradual training for lay people?

I’m happy to have recently come across hillside hermitage and the teachings presented here. The content is quite dense to say the least so I’m wondering if there is a system or guide for those at day one? 
All the best .

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/18x5imq/is_there_a_comprehensive_guide_or_system_of_the/kg4efjk/)** _2024-01-03 13:15:38:

    A useful point to bear in mind is that there is no hope to correctly begin with any of the subsequent "stages" of the Gradual Training if the precepts have not been covered. So for example, a person would be better served addressing whatever is preventing them from becoming celibate than trying to practice sense restraint and abandonment of hindrances within non-celibacy. One cannot even correctly grasp what sense restraint is if the mind isn't already settled in celibacy, because that "restraint" will all be about superficially denying something that one deep down still plans to give in to at some point—meaning, one is already "grasping the signs and features" of sensual objects by default, even when one actively tries to do the opposite.

    Another thing worth mentioning that may not be apparent from the usual formulation of the Gradual Training is that even the first step of virtue is not just about keeping the letter of the precepts. The Buddha says it's about "seeing the danger in the slightest fault", meaning that even things that are not covered by the precepts one should be vigilant about. For instance, frivolous speech and carelessness in interactions with others is not prohibited by the precepts, but it certainly is a "fault" that comes within the training, a central one at that, given that there can be no restraint of mind without restraint of speech beforehand. In a lay setting that is even more important, as one is forced to interact with people that do not share one's values of renunciation, and for whom speech is a central outlet for delight in pleasure and distraction.

    Aside from that, the Gradual Training shouldn't really be thought of as a "systematic process", but as one thing that can be practiced on subsequent degrees of subtlety: not acting out unwholesomely by body, speech, and mind. A person who understands that "simple" instruction in its full scope fulfills all the "elements" of the Gradual Training all at once without explicitly thinking about them. In fact, even the first "step" of "seeing the danger in the slightest fault", when refined to the utmost, already covers the entire practice all the way to samādhi. Abandoning mental "faults" (hindrances), which are just like bodily and verbal faults but on a subtler level, is the cultivation of samādhi; absorbing oneself on objects is unrelated to the Gradual Training and not right samādhi, because it has nothing to do with virtue except in some fabricated and tenuous ways (which is why people that haven't even started the Gradual Training can get that "samādhi" too).

    So overall, one can try to emphasize individual aspects of the overall picture of restraint and wholesome conduct that seem to require more work than others in one's particular case, but ultimately one should be looking to extract the general principle of noticing when one's mind is leaning towards things with craving, and then restraining accordingly.

    That principle then underlies one's entire life 24/7, and the specifics will be automatically covered.

    >Bhante, if I am not misquoting, you (or in HH) said that someone without the right view does not actually know where the craving is. 

    Yes, that's true. I wrote that in colloquial terms, but ultimately what a person without the view can restrain will never be craving but a *result* of craving, on account of which the actual craving may one day be recognized.

    >So, for someone who does not know this - should they instead see what the presently enduring feeling is (as in pleasant, painful or neutral) to understand the direction of craving and then not act out there? Is this a way to understand craving too?

    Yes, that's how one removes the obstructions for the knowledge of craving (the right view) to arise: not indulging in pleasant feelings, not resisting unpleasant ones, and not giving in to distraction in the face of neutral feelings. 

    But still, one also needs to upgrade one's understanding of feelings themselves, as even that is inaccurate as a puthujjana. Understanding feelings correctly means understanding craving by necessity.

### The mechanism of doubt

 This morning I've tried to dig out certain HH video concerning the workings of doubt, the one, if I remember correctly, in which the resolution of doubts is said to be found in starving them out by not feeding (into) them. Basically, an interrogation of doubts was recognized as the food for their growth and sustenance.

Maybe I'm confabulating because the only HH's video on the topic I'm able to find now is the one with a nearly opposite account on it (the one titled "The Pain of Doubt") - Ajahn Nyanamoli advices there a thorough examination as a way for resolving any doubts.

In a sense I'm not only interested in recalling the name of the exact video in question (although I would be glad if someone could point me to it), but I would also like to hear some of the possible takes on these two seemingly different approaches dealing with doubt, especially since both seem very sound to me.

Should doubts be faced by interrogating them until nothing of them remains, or they should be seen as Mara's baits with which any contact necessarily leads to just further entanglements and more doubts?

    >  
    >Maybe I'm confabulating because the only HH's video on the topic I'm able to find now is the one with a nearly opposite account on it (the one titled "The Pain of Doubt") -

    The topic of how taking doubts at face value and trying to resolve them can be unwholesome has been addressed so many times, including in talks whose main topic was something else, that it'd be hard to pinpoint a specific one based only on this description.

    >Ajahn Nyanamoli advices there a thorough examination as a way for resolving any doubts.

    In fact, what was said in this video actually means the same thing: the examination is not about what *the doubt is about* but about one's present situation of a mind that craves for answers. That is the "level" where any examination that develops the mind has to apply; anything else will be just furthering one's knowledge and learning *about* the Dhamma (which can be useful, but should never be confused with the mental cultivation of not acting out of hindrances that eventually allows one to see the Dhamma).

    Most of the time and for most people, the answers they already have are good enough if they have been not only learning about the Dhamma for a while but especially been clearing up the wrong views embedded in most of contemporary Buddhism. So there comes a point where one should start emphasizing putting what one already knows (that acting out of pressure of any kind is unwholesome and a hindrance to understanding) into practice rather than finding ever-better answers, as that is an endless task.

    Fundamentally, the pressure to find a new answer, like any other pressure such as sensuality, is rooted in a *mental state* that is present and is unpleasant, so by descending into the content of one's thoughts, whether it's theoretical information about the Dhamma, thoughts of sensuality or ill will, one is automatically falling into the trap of craving against displeasure on that internal, more "ambiguous" level, whereas externally in the case of thinking about the Dhamma, it all might seem fully justified and wholesome to one's superficial examination.

    A good test to see if it's better just to endure the discomfort of doubt rather than give in to it and look for the answer is to check how one would feel if no answer were to be found in the end. If the mere thought of it makes you feel anxious, most likely there is an underlying craving there that you better not act out of, because if you do, *there will be no satisfactory answer in the end for that very reason.* As in, even if you were to go to the Buddha himself and receive the best possible answer, it would still leave you unsatisfied because there is a *mental* *state* of dissatisfaction, plain and simple, underlying your entire experience.

    As a matter of fact, acting out of such seemingly "justified" pressures, as would become apparent over time, actually leaves you vulnerable to all the *other* pressures that were seemingly unrelated. For example, every sensual object you encounter will be that much more pressing and evocative of lust once you have given up on the quest for the answer, because you were *cultivating craving*, regardless of *what* it was directed toward. So then the same craving will now just rest upon the next thing that takes center stage, whether it be in the form of sensuality, aversion, laziness, or restlessness. (That's why the hindrances are fundamentally five expressions of the same thing, they cannot be abandoned or managed one-by-one by repressing thoughts).

    &#x200B;

    >Should doubts be faced by interrogating them until nothing of them remains, or they should be seen as Mara's baits with which any contact necessarily leads to just further entanglements and more doubts?

    So, both, because the "interrogation" is on the level of the intention behind, your present situation, what is being ignored, etc. (and that's where all the information about what craving is, why it's the root of suffering, etc., would eventually be recognized as a truth rather than as an idea). Failing to interrogate oneself  correctly on *that* level automatically leads to biting Māra's baits, because lack of clarity about one's mind state and overall situation here and now is all it takes to fall prey to those. One doesn't have to *knowingly* bite the baits to get hooked; it's more like the default state of ignorance means already biting them.

    "Nothing of the doubts" will remain when you cease to resist the discomfort that pushes you to look for answers (without getting rid of it either). That is the only real "end" to doubt, as uncertainty and its concomitant discomfort is a natural element of all experience and it cannot, nor needs to be removed.

    It should also be noted that not acting out of the pressure of doubt doesn't mean ceasing to receive the utterance-of-another (Suttas, Dhamma talks, etc.). It means that one shouldn't do it in cases when that "itch" that will just worsen upon scratching is the primary motivating factor, until the itch ceases. If the action is not a "scratch" to the itch and one knows it makes no difference to it, then it's fine (and that applies to all other hindrances too).

    Repeated instruction helps prevent one from inadvertently twisting what one has heard to fit with one's wrong views.

### Physicality of Breath

Hello all, just have a question pertaining to the discernment of breathing as ajahn has described.  

It seems like intrinsically it is all about discerning that the breath is the basis for the continued life of the body, always.  Physicality of breath is just a sensation within that.  However, he also mentions that sometimes you want to "do" and breathing is the most wholesome type of doing.

Does this mean that essentially while enduring pressure, you can find the sensation of breath and essentially take refuge in it while the senses are under attack?

Thanks everyone :)

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/18sbwjy/physicality_of_breath/kf9cmiw/)** _2023-12-28 12:38:56:

    >Physicality of breath is just a sensation within that.

    No, quite the opposite. The "physicality" of the *breathing body*, not of *the breath*, is what should be discerned; sensations are irrelevant and secondary to the physicality. Even if you experienced no sensations on account of it, you would still know beyond doubt that you're breathing. That's just how it works because it's an *intention*, not a process that happens by itself and that you "observe" from an independent point of view.

    &#x200B;

    >However, he also mentions that sometimes you want to "do" and breathing is the most wholesome type of doing.

    Yes, but that was in a particular context. Only with the Right View does one know what is wholesome and unwholesome, to begin with. So "doing" the breathing will only be wholesome if the Right View is there as the criterion.

    &#x200B;

    >Does this mean that essentially while enduring pressure, you can find the sensation of breath and essentially take refuge in it while the senses are under attack?

    So no, because as soon as you talk about "sensations", what you are referring to is shifting your attention to something else as to become unaware of the pressure.

    Rather, the physicality of breathing can be known while pressure is being endured, because that is happening on a different level than the pressure. Sensations are even more particular than the pressure, let alone the physicality, so if you direct your attention to that, you are actually diminishing your context even more than if you had just stayed with the pressure as it was and done nothing.

### Emptiness in the suttas?

I was reading the suttanipata yesterday and found a sutta with this:

>The monk who hasn't slipped past or turned back, knowing with regard to the world that "**All this is unreal**," sloughs off the near shore & far — as a snake, its decrepit old skin.  
>  
>[Thanissaro, Snp 1.1](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/snp/snp.1.01.than.html)

It seems the predominant translation choice is 'unreal' for the highlighted phrase besides B. Sujato who renders it as such:

>They have not run too far nor run back,  
Yo nāccasārī na paccasārī,  
for they know that **nothing in the world is what it seems**.  
*Sabbaṁ vitathamidanti ñatva loke*;  
Such a mendicant sheds the near shore and the far,  
So bhikkhu jahāti orapāraṁ,  
as a serpent its old worn-out skin.  
Urago jiṇṇamivattacaṁ purāṇaṁ.

Which translation is accurate? If it *is* indeed 'unreal', how should it be understood? I find 'realness' and 'unrealness' very vaguely defined in nearly any conversation surrounding it. When I myself refer to real, I don't know what quality/property that refers to within my experience; is it the presence of phenomena within experience? No clue. But if that is the case, well certainly you can't deny the fact of things being present? So that lends me to thinking that this can't be the meaning.

Would appreciate any insight.

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/18r00g7/emptiness_in_the_suttas/keyk5si/)** _2023-12-26 06:43:47:

    There is no concept of "real vs. unreal" in the Suttas.  *vitatha* is more like "false" or "untrue".

    But even if one chooses to translate it as "unreal", it would not automatically wrong. The problem is what people actually *mean* with that, and usually, it's the idea that there is some "True Reality" underlying our experience that is "hidden", but nevertheless we somehow know it exists (a contradiction in terms). Even worse, that reality is then inadvertently conceived to be accessible through special *perceptions* and *experiences* that one can gain through meditation, making it very much within the same ordinary reality of perception and the aggregates in its *nature,* just that the *content* of it is "special" and "extraordinary", as if that were of any relevance.

    &#x200B;

    >“Therefore, bhikkhus, any kind of form whatsoever, whether past, future, or present, internal or external, ***gross or subtle, lowly or sublime,*** far or near, all form should be seen as it really is with correct wisdom thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’

    “Any kind of feeling whatsoever … Any kind of perception whatsoever … Any kind of volitional formations whatsoever … Any kind of consciousness whatsoever, whether past, future, or present, internal or external, ***gross or subtle, lowly or sublime***, far or near, all consciousness should be seen as it really is with correct wisdom thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’

    —SN 22.59

    Some Suttas talk about the aggregates being "empty" and "devoid of essence", such as SN 22.95. But the difference is that the Buddha is not implicitly positing something "more real" and "not empty" that lies beneath the aggregates (as if something "outside" the aggregates can even be designated or experienced, when the aggregates *are* experience full stop), and contrasting a "conventional reality" with a mystical "ultimate reality".

    He's just saying that *everything* is devoid of essence, including any notions that you might have of something that *isn't* devoid of essence, which would have to be nothing but another perception. That's it.

    So if you want, you could say that "everything is unreal" for as long as you don't peripherally designate something that *is* real, which leads to eternalism in disguise, even in the name of Nibbāna (which as far as I've seen seems to be present in Thanissaro's view). When your mind posits something as "real", you would have to include that within "unreal", even if seems like it's Nibbāna itself. That's the true all-encompassing dispassion and freedom from conceivings.

### Why is anicca explained in these two forms: impermanent and un-ownable

why is anicca explained as impermanent in some places and un-ownable elsewhere.. the un-ownable aspect is more vivid, that these are totally not under my control..
I can relate to the impermance aspect as: I have no say in their disappearance.. how else to understand impermance

    *anicca* does literally mean "impermanent", but the problem is that nowadays that term tends evoke in people the notion that it's about *observing* change like a scientist would, like how it's commonly taught that one realizes *anicca* by *observing t*he constant arising and passing of phenomena, "zooming" into the experiences even closer until one can see even more changes per second, etc.

    And all of that fails to show why the Buddha said all that is anicca is dukkha, and that *because* they are dukkha, they are anattā. It instead jumps right into saying that because everything is always changing, there can be no "lasting entity", and that's what anattā is (meaning, it's about "no-self" instead of "not-self", so it's the extreme of annihilationism in disguise).

    Also, if things in our experience are constantly changing and never remain the same from one moment to the next, there is no reason why that has to be dukkha. One could very well find a kind of happiness in there being perpetual novelty and that one never has to "cross the same river twice", as they say.

    So the term "unownable" is to point towards the type of impermanence that matters, meaning the impermanence that is always necessarily dukkha, and thus prevents you from taking *anything* that you see in that way as "mine".

    Things are anicca not because you are *witnessing* or *have witnessed* their change, but because you *know* that you can't prevent them from changing (i.e., you can't own them), even if they last an uncountable amount of eons. On the contrary, the thing needs to still be present for you to know that it's *liable to change* (and that's what anicca is, hence it's always synonymous with *vipariṇāmadhamma* in the Suttas). When a thing truly "disappears", you can't know anything about its nature anymore.

    So that's how one can undermine one's sense of self (by applying this discernment on the emotional level of one's attachments, including one's very body and aggregates), whereas with the "observable change" wrong view of anicca, the sense of self always remains the "witnesser" at the background who is still seen as permanent and pleasurable.

### Undistorted Translation of the Arrow Sutta (SN 36.6)



- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/18ppxrp/undistorted_translation_of_the_arrow_sutta_sn_366/keu7k9h/)** _2023-12-25 06:56:23 *(in reply to a comment not included)*:

    What you are comparing are relative trivialities, not where the distortions I referred to are. There is undeniably room for different sentence structures and constructions in English to render what the Pāli says without any issue. What there *isn't* room for is using English terms (at the important points of doctrine) that do not at all correspond to the Pāli to justify the translator's interpretation of the Sutta (or worse, inserting new ones that aren't even there).

    The first example is the very beginning:

    &#x200B;

    >Sujato: “When an unlearned ordinary person experiences ***painful physical feelings*** they sorrow and wail and lament, beating their breast and falling into confusion. They experience two feelings:physical and mental.  
    >  
    >Suddhāso: “Monks, when an uneducated commoner is touched by a ***painful*** ***sensation***, he sorrows, frets, and laments, beating his chest and wailing, and becomes confused. He feels two feelings – one ***physical*** and one mental.  
    >  
    >Thanissaro: “When touched with a feeling of pain, the uninstructed run-of-the-mill person sorrows, grieves, & laments, beats his breast, becomes distraught. So he feels two ***pains***, ***physical*** & mental.  
    >  
    >Bodhi: “Bhikkhus, when the uninstructed worldling is being contacted by a painful feeling, he sorrows, grieves, and laments; he weeps beating his breast and becomes distraught. He feels two feelings—a bodily one and a mental one.  
    >  
    >Mine: “An untrained ordinary person, being contacted by unpleasant feeling, sorrows, wails, laments, beats their breast and becomes muddled. They feel two feelings: bodily and mental.  
    >  
    >Pali: assutavā, bhikkhave, puthujjano dukkhāya vedanāya phuṭṭho samāno socati kilamati paridevati urattāḷiṁ kandati sammohaṁ āpajjati. So dve vedanā vedayati—kāyikañca, cetasikañca.

    In this case Bhikkhu Bodhi's translation does not deviate from the Pāli in a significant way (although I prefer "unpleasant" over "painful" since the later has physical connotations that are not present in the word *dukkha*). A second example is found in the verse:

    >Sujato: A wise and learned person **isn’t affected** by feelings of pleasure and pain.  
    >  
    >Thanissaro: The discerning person, learned, doesn’t ***sense*** a ***(mental)*** feeling of pleasure or pain.  
    >  
    >Bodhi: The wise one, learned, does not feel the pleasant and painful ***mental*** feeling.  
    >  
    >Suddhāso: “The wise one who has learned much Does not feel pleasure or pain.  
    >  
    >Mine: One who understands and is learned does not feel pleasure and unpleasure.  
    >  
    >Pali: Na vedanaṁ vedayati sapañño, Sukhampi dukkhampi bahussutopi;

    In this instance, Bhikkhu Suddhāso's translation is accurate, although there are several issues with his overall, especially the one mentioned above which recurs throughout.

    Overall, Bhikkhu Bodhi's translation is the least divergent from the Pāli. Nevertheless, there are still discrepancies in his that are not found in the others, such as "*when* \[the puthujjana\] he seeks delight in sensual pleasure... *when* he does not understand \[the origin, ending, gratification...\]" giving the impression that *sometimes* the puthujjana can be free from these underlying tendencies. It's also not accurate to translate "kāmasukhaṃ abhinandati" as "*seeks delight* in sensual pleasure", implying that all the puthujjana has to do to be like the noble disciple is stop *actively* seeking sensual pleasures. The Pāli is simply saying that they delight in the pleasure of *kāma,* not that they *seek* it, because that's the only way they know how to (seemingly) escape *dukkha vedanā.*

    That's why I mentioned recently that even the pleasure of enlightenment they anticipate  ( even on account of saying no to sensual pleasures on a particular basis) comes within sensuality for a *puthujjana*. It's a very subtle thing that doesn't have to be on the level of coarse sensual activites.

    >Do you understand it like the puthujjana goes through all these stages when contacted by the first arrow, or are these the only possible options a puthujjana can have, all of them being one way to get hit by that second arrow? I'm thinking the latter but I don't want to rule out anything and since the 3 parts aren't delimited..

    It's certainly the latter. It's not explicitly stated of course, but it's stated clearly enough that all of it is happening *because* the puthujjana does not understand the nature of feelings, not because some sort of "process" is unfolding that a puthujjana could somehow come in between and stop, which is how these things are usually thought of.

    Even if it hypothetically *were* a process consisting of stages, one could only "stop" it by understanding the nature of those feelings as it says, meaning both the arrow of displeasure and the pleasure of sensuality. And one who understands that is by definition not a puthujjana anymore.

    Furthermore, as stated in my other reply above, "delighting in the pleasure of sensuality" does not mean a puthujjana cannot help but to *act* out of sensuality. Of course they can, and they must not turn their internal delight into external actions if they hope to overcome the second arrow. The point is that *even* if they don't act out, their mind *understands* no escape apart from the suffering than overriding it with a new pleasure, so they have no choice but to either put up with the suffering internally (which is what could eventually give rise to wisdom) or seek sensual pleasures, sweeping the suffering under the rug without ever actually solving its underlying cause (and this is all that "meditation" usually achieves for people in the end, hence wrong meditation also comes within the delight in sensuality the puthujjana uses as an escape).

    &#x200B;

    >Also, I keep hearing and reading about the gratification of sensuality and I'm curious about what is this gratification referring to?

    Thanks for taking the time to write this; it raises some good points for discussion.

    &#x200B;

    >the inner speech i was having was smth like "why me... poor me... how long is it going to last this time... this is absolutely unbearable... what have i done to deserve it... when is the next attack going to happen"  
    >  
    >\[...\]  
    >  
    >this experience of pain taught me a lot. and when i encountered this sutta, it was the passage i quoted that was the most precise description of the style of thoughts i was having while undergoing this kind of pain. and it is this that i regard, experientially, as the second arrow. the background feeling of pain being for me, affecting me, tormenting me. when the pain itself is intense, the thoughts are the unnoticed background; pain tends to impose itself so much to awareness that it is as if there is only pain there, nothing else -- a total immersion in pain -- and the thoughts are not noticed as such, while they are still operating. background awareness helps reveal how they operate, and their presence as such. and based on this, i would add a bit more nuance to what the second arrow is: it is this background feeling of the unpleasant tormenting ME, being FOR ME. i agree that it is not a second thing in time following physical pain -- although, in my case, it was easier to discern it with regard to physical pain. it was there, regardless if it was about intense pain, mild displeasure, or even intense unexpected pleasure: pleasure creates an opposite reaction -- but of the same type. the thoughts i used to have when undergoing unexpected surprise pleasure were "oh... what have i done to deserve this... how long is it going to last this time" -- precisely of the same type as those correlated with pain. \[not beating my chest lol, but feeling a kind of melting into the unexpected pleasure, which was just as reflexive as the mental wailing in the case of pain.\]

    To put it concisely, the thing is that, as I alluded to in footnote 6, these thoughts and reactions you describe are the *first arrow*, not the second one. That's why it's said in SN 35.28 that the *sense bases themselves*, including the sixth, are "on fire" with the defilements—*"on fire with* ***sorrow, lamentation, sadness, despair***\*...".\*

    So, as the Sutta goes on, what a noble disciple does to become liberated is become *disenchanted* with that whole thing, not *manage* the first arrow, because that's Māra's domain (i.e. the arising of these thoughts). In fact, in MN 144 we see Ven. Channa, who as an Arahant, experiencing what could be argued as "negative thoughts" and a lot of mentions of "mine" on account of the pains he was experiencing, showing that this cannot possibly be the second arrow, nor appropriation, nor craving, nor anything unwholesome. The thoughts were "negative" to the point that he even went on to commit suicide.

    Physical pain in itself is meaningless—it's when these thoughts and significances are there that the first arrow is there. That's why in (right) samādhi one is free from the first arrow temporarily even as a puthujjana—one is temporarily free from these *reactions* of the mind, but even as the extremely rare puthujjana that can enter jhāna, they would not have understood the escape from those thoughts when they *do* arise. Not having the first arrow on account of samādhi does not and cannot possibly mean that physical pain is not cognized when harm is inflicted on the body or there is an illness (unless one is in some sort of trance, in which case it isn't right samādhi then).

    &#x200B;

    >I am not afraid of fear,  
    >  
    >our teacher is expert in the Deathless  
    >  
    >Where fear cannot settle  
    >  
    >On that path the bhikkhus walk.

    Theragātha 21

    You could replace "fear" with any type of thinking, including the what you describe. That is what Ajahn Nyanamoli means with the phrase "not suffering amidst suffering". The true distinctive achievement of the noble disciple is not sorrowing amidst arisen sorrow, not lamenting amidst arisen lamentation, and that is what is called "uprooting" of suffering as opposed to "management", and that is why it's so subtle and hard to see, but at the same time there is nothing that can stand in the way of that freedom, not even "bad" states of the aggregates arising. At the end of the day, even these thoughts are the subtlest part of one's "environment" (the six sense base, the All), and seeking freedom on that level is a subtler form of trying to prevent external agitating events from happening to one.

    &#x200B;

    >and -- respectfully -- i would disagree explicitly with the idea in one of the footnotes:  
    >  
    >*This statement is also at odds with the idea that the first arrow is physical pain. People don’t seek sensuality in response to physical discomfort.*  
    >  
    >they do. and it's not just my experience -- i checked it with others as well. when physical pain is really intense, sensuality is one of the outlets: with pain present, one seeks to add pleasure to it -- to make it be not just pain. been there, done that, in various ways, and i talked with others who were doing the same -- so it is a possibility. and pleasure is seen as a form of temporary escape from the intensity of the pain until it subsides on its own -- the fact that some people don't use sensuality this way, or that it's not an obvious way of using sensuality when one thinks of it, does not mean that when one undergoes hellish pain one would not seek sensuality as a form of relief -- as misguided as that might be -- and take at least part of one's attention from the pain that tends to impose itself as the only thing there. **\[of course, it s not just the physical pain that plays into this, but its felt unbearability** \-- but the tendency to run into sensuality as a way of soothing the chronic pain would not be so appealing without the intense physical pain there as well, and without its being felt as unbearable.

    &#x200B;

    It's *only* the "felt unbearability" that plays into it.

    Sure, intense physical pain will *99% of the time* be accompanied by an intense first arrow, which in a puthujjana will inevitably be accompanied by the second, *on account of which* they will then seek sensual gratification.  But that doesn't mean that the physical pain *is* what motivates the seeking, which is what you seem to suggest. Again, physical pain by itself is meaningless, and given a good enough reason to put up with it, such as saving the life of a loved one, even a puthujjana would experience not even a first arrow on account of it.

    The second arrow is **not knowing the escape, not knowing how to remain unmoved by** the first arrow, which is the *reflexive* perceptions, feelings, and intentions that revolve, sorrow and lament around the physical pain. That "not knowing the escape" means that there is (mental) lamentation on top of the (bodily/six-sense-base/aggregate) lamentation, the suffering amidst suffering, that a puthujjana is yoked to. *That* is what makes it "unbearable", not the intensity of the physical pain.

    Edit: Mental phenomena like the thoughts of lamentation you describe are not the second arrow because of what the Buddha says in MN 109 which Ajahn Nyanamoli quotes often: the five aggregates are *not* upādāna, but there is no upādāna without the five aggregates. If *these thoughts* were the problem, it would mean that the content of the aggregates is to blame for the upādāna.

    >part of our disagreement is a difference in emphasis in how we read the arrow sutta. the symmetrical structure of it (the puthujjhana experiences the "sorrow, wailing, lamentation" etc., the ariyasavaka doesn't) leads me to interpret precisely the "sorrow, wailing, lamentation" as the second arrow -- experienced by one, not experienced by the other,

    Yes, I am not at all denying that that's what the Sutta says. Our disagreement is about *what* is that "sorrow, wailing, lamentation\*. I'm not saying that the ariyasāvaka sorrows, laments, beats their breast and becomes confused when they feel unpleasant feeling, because, as it says, the absence of that is exactly the distinction. What I am saying is, if there are no intentions and thoughts of "I don't want this; when will this go away, etc.", which we can for the sake of argument call "sorrowing thoughts", *that is not actually an unpleasant feeling/first arrow in the first place*. It's either neutral or somewhat pleasant, even if the physical pain (which is never *feeling*; it's a *perception*) is very intense.

    >another thing -- i would disagree that physical pain (or anything at all) is meaningless in itself. we experience it as *already meaningful*. its meaning might change -- but the fact of meaningfulness doesn't.

    This which you wrote actually serves to illustrate my point. When I wrote "meaningless" what I was trying to convey is that there is no such thing as a physical sensation *alone*, certainly not if it can be called *vedanā* to begin with. It always *has* to have some meaning in order to be a discernible phenomenon in the first place. And "why is this happening to me; when will this end, etc." *are meanings*. That's literally all they are in the eyes of a noble disciple. But a puthujjana cannot help but to go with the grain of those meanings and welcome them when they arise. All they know how to do is either welcome those meanings which are inseparable from the feeling, which then automatically leads them to delighting in sensuality, or try to get rid of the meanings so as to wriggle out of the feeling. They can't continue to feel the *same* unpleasant feeling without suffering; they need to alter the characteristics of the arisen experience in some way or another, no matter how subtle, to not suffer (thus we call that "management" as opposed to "uprooting").

    The ariyasāvaka, on the other hand, needs to do *nothing* to change the feeling nor the meanings that accompany it (which are perceptions and intentions, and any of the other aggregates which they also do not identify with) in order to not suffer, because they have understood the escape from feeling *the way it has arisen*.

    **Thus, the** ***citta*** **of the noble disciple (thus the second arrow is "cetasika") does not sorrow and lament when such phenomena arise at the six sense base/aggregates ("bodily"; see also the footnote in the document referring to SN 22.1).**

    To illustrate, imagine you have a dog that has a bad habit of yelping and barking a lot. Now, if that dog is *yours*, you will be emotionally burned just by hearing its noises, even if you know full well that you can't actually do anything about it. But if the dog is *not yours*, then no matter what noises it makes, *which will certainly still constitute an annoyance*, you *can't* actually feel that burden that comes with ownership of the dog, *even if you wanted to.* And that's the difference. A noble disciple does not need to get the dog to stop doing whatever it's doing to be free from suffering because he understands the escape from the dog, whereas a puthujjana doesn't, so his freedom depends on the dog being in a certain favorable state.

    And whether the dog is yapping because it's hungry, because it feels some excrutiating physical pain, because it has perceived a female in heat, or because it simply wants to go for a walk, makes no difference. In its nature, it's still exactly the same annoyance *for you* (this is the first arrow of unpleasant feeling full stop, which, as the Sutta starts, is experienced by both puthujjana and ariyasāvaka). As a matter of fact, *what* specifically is the cause for the dog's woes, in this case the physical pain, only matters when the dog is *yours*—if it isn't, then to you it's just the same annoying noise all the same. The physical pain, or anything else, is entirely just the dog's problem: as Ajahn Nyanamoli has often said, only the senses have access to their respective objects—"you" can't actually experience (painful) touches, in this case. So only if the senses (the dog) are already taken as "mine" can touches (which include the most excruciating physical pains) be assumed to be of any relevance.

    One might genuinely get a sense of relief by getting the dog to stop making noise, and there are times when it's fine to do so (i.e., if it's not against the precepts), but one should never conflate that with *disowning* the dog altogether. It's confusing virtue and restraint (regarding thoughts too) with the Dhamma (total non-ownership).That's how one remains honest about the unbridgeable gap between management and uprooting of suffering.

    &#x200B;

    >and, as far as i can tell, i don't simply repress them. the condition for their arising is not there any more -- the attitude of appropriating

    So, in summary, the actual "attitude of appropriating" is the need for certain phenomena to be absent from the experience. That's what we mean with "endurance on the right level".

    Additionally, the greatest problem with this conception of the second arrow is that, with it, a puthujjana *could* experience freedom from it at certain times (by manipulating the meanings that accompany physical pain so that it's no longer unpleasant). But that is a contradiction in terms, because the cessation of the arrow can *only* come with understanding the origin, ending, gratification, danger and escape in regard to feelings, as the Sutta says. And a person who knows that is by definition not a puthujjana, and it can never be forgotten or lost once it's known, so truly experiencing no second arrow "once" means never experiencing it *ever again*.

    Hence the absolute binary: (1) one either experiences the second arrow *whenever* the first is there, no matter how skillfully the first can *mostly* be avoided, or (2) one doesn't get hit the second arrow *ever*, and doing so has become totally inconceivable. There is no "in between".

    That is hard to accept, but it's actually good news. If it weren't like this, the threshold at which one is a sotāpanna and not a puthujjana would have to be subject to *doubt* (the third fetter)—meaning that every such "sotāpanna" is in reality a puthujjana.

    There's simply no debate that someone who can remain at peace ***even*** when such deeply personal and inducive-of-ownership thoughts arise on their own has achieved a much deeper sort of peace than someone whose peace is defined by the absence of those thoughts, or of any phenomenon, for that matter. No matter how well one can prevent those things *now*, the fact of impermanence and non-ownership of the aggregates means one will at some point fail to do so.

    >but what is there might present itself as having a totally different meaning from the meaning that was assumed before discerning.

    Yes, that's quite possible, but there is nothing *fundamental* about this that would make a puthujjana unable to achieve it. The fact that the change of meaning was effected through anicca, dukkha, and anattā contemplations on paper, for instance, does not make it any more intrinsically "Buddhist" compared to if it was effected by thinking about how God is the one who gets to decide all that happens to one and thus one should not lament in the face of pain.

    Genuinely, that could lead to the same result of not experiencing such "meanings".

    What makes the absence of the second arrow "Buddhist", what makes it the sole province of ariyasāvakas, is that *meanings* are always already abandoned as they are, in whichever way they are, in any and every situation.

    &#x200B;

    >“So you should see any kind of form at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: ***all*** form—as it really is with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’  
    >  
    >***Any*** kind of feeling at all …  
    >  
    >***Any*** kind of perception at all …  
    >  
    >***Any*** kind of activities at all …  
    >  
    >You should see any kind of consciousness at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: ***all*** consciousness—as it really is with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’

    —SN 22.59

    Conversely, as I already alluded to, there is simply no way to be *ultimately sure* that those meanings will never arise again. In the end, it's a matter of inference and reasoning based on what one has read and learned that one would conclude that because something has been discerned, even if it's the right teaching on paper, certain phenomena will cease to appear. For example, one could hypothetically meet the Buddha in real life and be told that those phenomena will actually come back, and if one had unshakable faith in him,  which a sotāpanna is supposed to, one *could* fall into doubt, meaning that can't be the measure of sotāpatti.

    Whereas, when the second arrow is truly not there, there is no way to doubt that it cannot return, no matter what meanings arise or don't arise. Precisely *because* that freedom does not depend on any circumstances of arising or ceasing—no matter if they are (thought to be) out of the question on the one hand or very likely on the other—it is known beyond question as "inconceivable to not be there".

    Fundamentally, as long as you can *imagine* something, it is possible, and thus it still exists to that extent. There is no way to entirely guarantee that it will never turn from possibility into actuality, because the aggregates are uncertain.

    >Neither of them suffer a second arrow in that instance. But in the case of the ariya-savvaka it is because he cannot suffer AMIDST the arisen discomfort (which would include all the habitual grumbly thoughts as one might imagine) - in the case of the puttujhana it is because he HAPPENS to not experience a first arrow of discomfort on that same account. Obviously, the two cases are not mutually exclusive. But the former should not be conflated with the latter.

    That basically summarizes the points I've been making. And also, that's why sense restraint (which is about "not grasping signs and features" of perceptions that give rise to unwholesome, such as with these  "grumbly thoughts") is indispensable, and it does bring about benefits on its own, even without the Dhamma—as in, reducing the intensity of the "first arrows" one experiences.

    If one hasn't been cultivating sense restraint enough, one will not be able to endure the entirety of the arisen suffering on the right level so as to eventually understand it, because the first arrow, and of course the second, will just be too intense.

    But then it's too easy to think that freedom lies in just going *further* in that direction to the extreme, so as to now prevent the "graspable" signs and features from *existing.* And that's when virtue and restraint gets confused with the Dhamma (taming the senses vs disowning them).

    &#x200B;

    >One NEEDS to start with the liability to both arrows that you have, and **accept that you'll only truly be able to see where the line between the two is in hindsight**, after the second arrow has fallen away. That attitude is essential for even a beginning of endurance on the right level.

    That's how it is, but the problem is that there's often this "subconscious" urge to feel like one *already* has access to the sotāpanna's point of view, to one's own detriment, as one will then not make the effort to clear up the very wrong views that obstruct one from having it.

    The type of humility that is required, as opposed to just a superficial quality of one's speech and bodily movements, is that of always keeping the Dhamma far ahead of oneself, while also pairing that with sincere striving to *develop* that thing which is still far away\*,\* instead of just encasing it in a shrine for admiration and not working toward attaining it, which is the other extreme of too much "humility".

    No, they *are* just following the gratification. A puthujjana would be forced to suffer if he doesn't get that gratification, whereas a noble disciple has the option to *neither* gratify the urge, nor suffer, ***nor*** get rid of the unpleasant feeling (management). But they might still choose to give in. Therefore, when they engage in sensuality it's because of laziness and complacency, not because of not having any other escape, and either way they're not suffering in comparison to a puthujjana.

    >I was under the impression that the pressure of the hindrances was because of the prospect of the gratification, that the prospect of gratification was where the pressure lied, I feel unpleasant and I'm pressured to act in a certain way that seems promising in releasing myself of that unpleasant sensation.

    >But if that's not the case, what constitutes the pressure of the hindrances if that is not to outrun the suffering?

    The prospect of gratification is where the pressure is, and for a puthujjana that "merges" with the assumption of self so that it becomes one thing, which is why they would factually be strengthening their self view by being unrestrained. So for them, not only will sensuality and ownership seem synonymous; they should also be regarding it like that for practical purposes.

    But for a sotāpanna the gratification is still there, while the self view, the cause for the need to outrun the suffering, is no longer there. Of course, seeking gratification is in itself suffering, but that's insignificant compared to the suffering of owning the aggregates.

    >Bhante, can this be expected of a noble disciple? I have a hard time believing a noble disciple can give in to sensuality? Are there examples of similar events in sutta's?

    Yes, all of the lay followers who were ariyas but not anāgāmi. MN 14 tells of how Mahānāma, a noble disciple, is still a layman enjoying sensual pleasures on account of his mind still being overtaken by unwholesome states.

    Yes, I'm aware of this Sutta. The thing is that the Buddha clearly formulated this teaching on the five faculties in a different context: in SN 48.40, it's explained that the faculty of *domanassa* (*cetasika dukkha)* would cease without remainder in the second jhāna, which hypothetically even a (very exceptional) puthujjana could attain. It's not talking about the *cetasika dukkha* that is permanently destroyed for a noble disciple due to their understanding of the nature of feeling and the underlying tendencies, which is what the Arrow Sutta is describing.

    Furthermore, SN 48.32 states that a sotāpanna (and even an Arahant in the next Sutta) would know the origin, ending, gratification, danger, and escape in regard to all of these five faculties, instead of saying that they now possess only some of them.

    >And again, why do we find the "kāyasamphassajaṁ"/"manosamphassajaṁ" distinction *aligned* with the distinction between "kāyikaṁ" and "cetasikaṁ"?

    Because *kāya* in itself means something different in this case, and so both *mano* and *citta* would be in opposition to the meaning of *kāya* used in SN 48.37. The *kāyika dukkha* referred to in SN 36.6 is something that will [never cease for as long as the six sense base is there](https://suttacentral.net/mn121/en/nyanamoli-thera?lang=en&reference=none&highlight=false) (i.e., until an Arahant's Parinibbāna), whereas the *kāyika dukkha* of SN 48.37 would cease completely with just the first jhāna (SN 48.40). The latter *is* more on the level of physical discomfort, unlike the Arrow Sutta.

### 37 factors of awakening

How one puts into practice, the 37 factors of enlightenment listed in DN 16,Mahaparinibbana sutta,

consisting of The Four Ways of Attending to Mindfulness,
the Four Right Strivings,
the Four Paths to Power,
the Five Faculties,
the Five Strengths,
the Seven Factors of Awakening,
the Noble Eight-Fold Path.

Are all these factors developed one after another? 

Or can one only check all these factors in an action? 

Thank you for your explanation and understanding

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/18pmj2t/37_factors_of_awakening/kepm5nv/)** _2023-12-24 06:14:02:

    The 7 enlightenment factors are *acquired* with stream-entry, as stated in SN 46.30. Also, in MN 2, they are at the very last section of the Sutta, which presupposes completion of the 1st part (abandoning the first three fetters), given that it says "reflecting *yoniso,* he develops these 7 factors". As stated in the beginning of the Sutta, it is because of not understanding *yoniso manasikāra* that one is a puthujjana.

    The pleasant feelings that may arise on account of practicing what one *thinks* are the 7 enlightenment factors are not a criterion for whether that idea is right or not. Even for the first factor, sati\*/\*recollection, one needs to have the Right View to know what is it that needs to be recollected and in what way. [Wrong view leads to wrong recollection.](https://suttacentral.net/sn45.1/en/bodhi?lang=en)

    Similarly, the [five faculties only exis](https://suttacentral.net/sn48.12/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=sidebyside&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin)t in someone who is [no longer a puthujjana.](https://suttacentral.net/sn25.1/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=sidebyside&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin)

    Even in the case of the four right strivings, it's about making effort to abandon unwholesome and cultivate wholesome. And that distinction is only known, again, [by a noble disciple.](https://suttacentral.net/mn9/en/bodhi?lang=en&reference=none&highlight=false)

    So one's goal should be to abandon wrong view and get the Right View, after which developing these 37 factors—or only one group because all of them are simply different formulations of the same thing—will be possible.

    >what is the difference between these factors for someone who has understood right view and someone who has not understood realizing right view?

    The thing is that, by definition, whatever a person without the Right View has faith in is necessarily a distortion, a similar but ultimately fake copy of the Dhamma (which only a noble disciple would be able to tell is wrong and why). That doesn't mean that the *teaching* and the *information* that ordinary person uses for their practice is wrong (although nowadays it very well might be); it means that their *internal interpretation* of the teaching, even if it is the purest, unadulterated Dhamma that they're receiving from the Buddha's own mouth, is distorted and inaccurate. If the teacher themselves is a puthujjana and thus only knows their own "fake copy" of the Dhamma and a person puts faith in *that* then the problem is of course doubled.

    This means that whatever effort, recollection, composure, and understanding that an ordinary person develops will *all* be rooted in that initial distortion of the Dhamma that they take to be the Dhamma, and the results of their practice will equally be wrong (while being unable to tell, because knowing wrong as wrong is what defines a sotapanna; how liberated a puthujjana *feels* is by no means a criterion). That's why as AN 10.103 says, wrong view culminates in wrong liberation.

    So what a puthujjana needs to do is make an effort to abandon their wrong understanding of the Dhamma, so that that which they have faith in, eventually, is *actually* the Dhamma. Once they reach that point, they will no longer be a puthujjana, but a least a follower by faith, the lowest type of ariya (SN 25.1 I referenced above), and *then* they will have the five faculties (SN 48.11). At that point they would also no longer be struck by the second arrow (SN 36.6), "just" on account of their faith being directed rightly unlike before, and will be forever freed from the lower realms (which includes intensely painful mental states in this very life too).

### Understanding Peripheral Awareness Pt 2

Last week I made a post on here about peripheral awareness, and contemplating the responses to that led me to at least upgrade my understanding.  I thought I'd post an updated version of my last post / some notes from my practice.  Hopefully it is helpful to others, would really appreciate critiques and comments just like last time too.  I really want to know if something I say is wrong, so I know where to look.  Let me know if this doesn't fit with what is wanted in this community, I really value when people share their own experiences and find it very helpful, but I don't want to be annoying.  A lot of people don't like talking about their practice but I feel like it's really helpful to put words to some of the subtle challenges / experiences that many of us probably share.  

The main problem before was that I was making peripheral awareness way too complicated without really understanding it fundamentally.  It's not really that complex, it's just a different direction than the mind generally goes.  I had a moment where I just realized that it's about having phenomena occur while you know their nature -- so it's knowing where things came from while they happen.  I think Ajahn said that verbatim in a video.  Anyhow, I realized that I had just been rehashing things I already "knew" over and over again actively, hoping for the experience to conform to whatever image of the right experience I had.  If the knowledge of the basis was not around in the form of observable thoughts, then I assumed something was wrong.  Because while still knowing about anatta, that everything was clearly arising on the basis of the body, etc, I still wanted my practice to be within the realm of my immediate control -- despite the fact that "me" is composed of things that are out of my control anyways.  And the realm of perceived control on the basis of self is the foreground.

But the reality is that you can't know something twice over - you know it or you don't.  Once you know it, the knowledge is there.  So the awareness that we are aiming for is actually awareness of the knowledge itself, not holding the knowledge as an object or something you can see.  Then it's just the foreground, the prior foreground is now the background. 

So instead I started observing what was actually occurring in the now, where I was appropriating that experience as self, and then realizing that it was already in the basis of the body, and by extension I must be breathing because the body is there.  And after a while it became clear that I already KNEW that, but I kept feeling like I had to apply the knowledge, even at a very subtle level, to individual experiences or they would be appropriated as self.

But then I recalled that he mentioned applying the knowledge of the basis to your experience as a whole.  So that is the path away from looking at individual phenomena.  It's like I was saying "okay, this is definitely here on account of the body, but what about that other thing here on account of the body, how did that get here?"  If all possible experiences fall under the same basis, no mental exertion needs to be applied to understanding each component.  They all have the same origin, same significance, and same ultimate fate.   

So while practicing on the level of the whole experience, I found also that the knowledge itself is very much persisting on its own, even when it is out of sight.  It really is, and it makes sense, because my image of self is obviously inaccurate -- things really don't need to be grasped in the foreground to exist.  They don't need to be maintained by the self, because one can only grasp things that are already there anyways.

That has led me to now.  Essentially, I sit and allow phenomena to occur as they will.  Those objects arise already within the basis of the body.  I already know that I know this, and I already know that I already know that I know this.  As they occur, I'm aware that I already know, and the phenomena just serve to validate that further.  It's like everything is falling into a box, and when it goes outside of the box, it's obvious because I start appropriating it.  So while appropriating at some point I see what is happening and know that I know where it came from, and then let it endure - the pressure is already off at that point.  

What I don't quite understand is HOW I know that I know without bringing anything to mind.  I'm fully within the experience, yet at some level I also know that I know where it came from.  As things arise, their origin is already known as not-self, so there isn't much room for resistance.  I love when the mind is racing now, just having that small sliver of knowing that you ALREADY KNOW where it came from is enough to stop fighting or analyzing -- over-analyzing has crippled me for years in meditation.  And that knowledge I just mentioned doesn't require any thinking at all.  It's more like a recognition of what is already there.  Once you let phenomena fall into that box, there is no reason to fight anything, the fight isn't even yours.  

So from where I'm standing now it seems like I just need to maintain this and endure whatever arises.  I've been trying to stay absolutely still as well, I'm not sure if that is important but it does seem to be a lot more turbulent so I've been sticking to that.  I see why sense restraint is so important now, because you definitely can't take this to fulfillment if you're still mindlessly appropriating things without seeing their actual basis.  It's really hard to see it in the first place.  I also see why the videos all seemed unclear at some level to me, it's because you have to not fully commit to the foreground, but how do you communicate that to someone who only knows the foreground?  It's not even an escape from the foreground, it's just an understanding of where it came from.  But legitimately conceiving how you would do that IN THE MOMENT is very difficult when your frame of reference is only foreground and self.  Another thing I realized is that you don't need to rehash what you already know once you know it.  I haven't said "im breathing, body is here" etc at all, I don't even try to look at that beyond implicitly and thoughtlessly understanding it as things arise on that basis.  But maybe I'm getting carried away because it's novel to me that I CAN do it like that at all.

I would really appreciate critiques to what I have described here, ANY opinions, etc.  Especially if I'm just flat out wrong like I was last time.  Really, any comment welcome, thanks so much to everyone who read this and HUGE thanks to everyone who responded to my last post, that had a direct impact on my practice.

    What seems to have happened is that you "loosened the strings" that were previously too tight, to use the oft-mentioned simile. You recognized to a slightly greater extent that your idea of sati was mixed with a craving to overly investigate things and "figure them out".

    The way that progress happens is basically that one repeatedly recognizes that one's practice had been either too tight or too loose, meaning one was either questioning, investigating, and attending to things too closely on the one end, or being *too* "open to whatever arises" on the other end (to put it coarsely). And each time that realization comes about, it feels like *everything* one was doing was completely wrong. This is why it's important to always be willing to start from scratch, and always assume one's practice to be necessarily off in *some* way that one is not yet aware of.

    Only then, after going through that "restart" process thousands of times, one will eventually have found the *actual* Middle Way, and will be unable to drift away from it unknowingly like before. That's when one sees the Fourth Noble Truth, meaning one knows what the Noble Eightfold Path actually is. Before that, one's eight factors are either "overshooting" or "undershooting" the mark, hence they cannot be called "noble" (and obviously that excludes the possibility of having actual jhānas, since for that one needs to be well versed in "tuning the strings" even as a puthujjana, which is why it would very quickly lead one to more than sotāpatti).

    What I see from what you've written is that you are probably not investigating and questioning your motivations and background attitudes *enough* now. So what you need to do is find a way to tighten the strings again without going all the way to where you were before, and then rinse and repeat for as many times as it takes, not being afraid of the thought that you might have to do it a million times more or even scrap the whole thing, even after decades of practice—taking all insights and seeming progress along the way with a pinch of salt because that's never what matters. What matters is whether you are *incapable* of ever doing something other than the right practice.

    The only reliable confirmation of that is what is described in SN 36.6, and that needs to be that way even when you don't try to practice.

    >Functionally, does restraining the senses force non-appropriation when practiced correctly, which then levels the ship in some sense, and keeps you in the right direction?  I can understand how sense restraint will diminish the pull of the senses, just logically as someone who has quit nicotine before.  Is it that appropriation that is the root of the enduring ignorance?

    No, non-appropriation can only be achieved by getting the Right View. Sense restraint only prevents one from taking the appropriation too far through actions. The important thing to understand is that appropriation is always there until one has the Right View, so one should never think that one is abandoning it even momentarily. If one does, one will never fully understand what the appropriation actually is, so all one will ever be able to do is restrain it, suppress it, and manage it, while falling into a wrong view that one is abandoning it. One who understands appropriation  and sees the way out of it is a sotāpanna.

    So as a puthujjana, even the practice of peripheral awareness, context of the body and so on will be taking place on the level of restraint and Gradual Training, not on the level of actually abandoning the sense of self and so on.

    &#x200B;

    >For instance, taking a warm shower out of a sensual desire. I can barely see the danger, honestly. But perhaps it is because that requires one to ASSUME ownership of the body itself, the pleasures of the body. Which just reinforces the wrong direction, reinforces the image of self, etc.

    The danger is not in taking a warm shower (or in anything specific like that), it's in acting out of a mental state affected by desire. So one needs to learn to discern one's mental states so as to see why such *sensuality in its nature* is dangerous. Otherwise, one will just be avoiding specific sense pleasures (which is necessary on the level of a precondition for understanding; the understanding of sensuality still needs to be developed).

### The suffering left for a stream-enterer (SN 56.49)

*“Mendicants, suppose a person was to place down on Sineru, the king of mountains, seven pebbles the size of mung beans.*

*What do you think, mendicants?*

*Which is more: the seven pebbles the size of mung beans? Or Sineru, the king of mountains?”*

*(...)*

*“In the same way, for a person with comprehension, a noble disciple accomplished in view, the suffering that’s over and done with is more, what’s left is tiny.*

*Compared to the mass of suffering in the past that’s over and done with, it doesn’t count, there’s no comparison, it’s not worth a fraction, since there are at most seven more lives."*

SN 56.49   


I was curious about the usage of this sutta by Ajahn Nyanamoli, along with the assertions that a sotapanna is unable to suffer amidst suffering.

The Buddha himself explains, that in this simile, for sotapannas the mountain is all the suffering of the past lives, and the pebbles are the possible seven (at most) future lives as a human. It makes sense, given that there is no discernible beginning of samsara and that the hells are a lot worse than the human realm. 

But Ajahn Nyanamoli sometimes presents it as if just during this present lifetime, a putthujana has a mountain of suffering, and a sotapanna has only 7 pebbles compared to that. Kinda ignoring all the craving that is left and how some bad circumstances can stir it up.

So, if we ignore samsara, does the simile still hold? I'll gladly hear your takes on this, especially Bhante's. 

If anyone more familiar with Ven. Nanavira's writings could share how he described the experience leading to his demise (i.e. was it suffering or rather a calculated decision without suffering?) that would be much appreciated too.

    >But Ajahn Nyanamoli sometimes presents it as if just during this present lifetime, a putthujana has a mountain of suffering, and a sotapanna has only 7 pebbles compared to that. Kinda ignoring all the craving that is left and how some bad circumstances can stir it up.

    The first thing to remember is that the Buddha did not give that simile within the context of rebirth specifically, or at least that could not have been his main intention, given that a sotāpanna doesn't even know for themselves that they will be reborn even once. That always remains to some extent a belief on the basis of faith and some amount of reasoning, and they accept it because they experience for themselves the sheer depth of the Buddha's teaching and the Four Noble Truths, and have no reason to doubt whatever the person who arrived at that ultimate insight by himself says, especially when it perfectly fits with everything that they do see here and now with their own understanding.

    So when the Buddha was referring to the 7 grains of sand left, the main context of that is the suffering that is destroyed in the present life through seeing the Dhamma.

    The answer as to how that is is given in SN 36.6. The "second arrow" is that mountain of suffering that is not present even in the sotāpanna (and note that the Sutta says "ariyasāvaka", not "Arahant", meaning it includes not only the sotāpanna but also the Dhamma- and saddhānusāri, the ones whose sotāpatti is guaranteed and are already ariyas).

    The "mountain of suffering" is there because of the fact that the puthujjana does not see the way out of suffering, no matter how fortunate their circumstances might be in this present life and that they may not experience any *actual* suffering. The fact that they are not certain that they can be unaffected by *any* displeasure that comes up means they are already affected here and now. The simile Ajahn Nyanamoli gave in the first chapter of Dhamma Within Reach was of a person who lives within a lion's enclosure. They may not have even seen any actual lions around, but the simple fact of *being there* and not knowing how to get out is tremendous suffering compared to one who is able to *at least* get out without fail whenever a lion comes, if not prevent themselves from being there in the first place.

    So yes, a sotāpanna does have craving left from the point of view of an Arahant, but the reason why they are still free from suffering compared to the puthujjana is that they are fully able to escape *even* the suffering that results from their own acting out of craving, sensuality and aversion. In other words, even if they *actively* commit actions that lead to suffering, it is impossible for them to experience suffering the way the puthujjana does. This is why so many householders in the Suttas went back to their ordinary lives after they saw the Dhamma, since they knew beyond doubt that no matter what they did, they wouldn't suffer compared to before. That can give rise to a great sense of complacency, which is why the Buddha had to encourage even ariyasāvakas to be diligent, etc.

    The principle explained in AN 3.100 about the lump of salt is explicitly about experiencing the results of kamma, but it works exactly the same way on the level of craving and suffering. The sotāpanna's mind does not experience, or only to a trifle amount, the suffering resulting from what would externally be the same amount of craving as an ordinary person.

    >i wasn't aware that a dhamma-follower (dhammānusārī), or faith-follower (saddhānusārī) are considered as ariyasāvaka. is this something that is stated in the suttas, or in the commentaries?

    Yes, it's stated in every Sutta of the Okkanta Saṃyutta, SN 25.

    &#x200B;

    >Someone who has faith and confidence in these teachings is called a follower by faith (*saddhānusāri*). They’ve arrived at surety in the right way, they’ve arrived at the level of true people (*sappurisabhūmi)*, and they’ve transcended the level of ordinary people (*puthujjanabhūmi).* They can’t do any deed which would make them be reborn in hell, the animal realm, or the ghost realm.

    >They can’t die without realizing the fruit of stream-entry.

    (On a related note, the term "sappurisa" also appears in the ubiquitous passage describing the ordinary persons' ignorance and contrasting it with the ariyasāvaka, such as in SN 36.6.)

    The takeaway is that even putting faith in the teachings correctly is something the puthujjana cannot do. That's because there already needs to be understanding in order for faith to apply rightly; otherwise, one can have all the faith one wants but it won't be directed to the true Dhamma which can only be seen through understanding. As soon as either faith or acceptance upon consideration are there for the true Dhamma, one is no longer a puthujjana, and one has acquired the five faculties including wisdom (SN 48.12). Not before that.

    Hence our insistence on the point that one should not assume one has access to the Dhamma and is practicing properly before stream entry. Even the popular chant of praise for the Saṅgha echoes this, "The Saṅgha of the Blessed One's disciples who is practicing rightly... that is the **four groups or the eight individuals**", with the sotāpattimagga (Dhamma or faith follower) being the eight individual. MN 34 also compares these two lowest ariyas to the very youngest calves in a herd of cattle who *will* *safely cross over to the far shore.*

    &#x200B;

    >i think it's important to note in regard to the salla sutta (sn 36.6), that although the second arrow of sorrow / grief may not be present on contact with painful bodily feelings for noble ones, stream enterers are not immune to sorrow / grief in its own right.

    >that is, stream enterers (and even once- and non-returners) will still experience sorrow / grief resulting from painful mental feelings **arising as a result of mind-contact with mental sense objects.**

    This seems to signify a common misunderstanding of the Arrow Sutta, probably influenced by how the meaning is lost in translation. "Mental suffering" is not "mānasika dukkha" or similar, which would refer to mano and mental phenomena  (dhammas), but "cetasika dukkha", referring to the citta—a distinction I make sure to emphasize whenever I can.

    So it's not saying that a noble one does not experience sorrow and grief on account of the five senses but only on account of mental sense objects. That would make no sense, as it would basically mean that every noble disciple is a non-returner, and furthermore it would be talking about something else altogether (the fetter of sensuality instead of suffering in general). With regard to the mention of "bodily feeling", it must also be borne in mind that the texts define the body as the whole six-sense base (MN 121), which is why in Suttas like MN 152, it is said that the Arahant ("the one with developed faculties") experiences agreeable and disagreeable and both-agreeable-and-disagreeable in regard to the sixth sense base. If "mental feeling" in SN 36.6 were to be referring to that when saying that an **ariyasāvaka**\*,\* not even an Arahant, does not experience it, there would be a glaring contradiction.

    The sorrow and grief, the second arrow that SN 36.6 is referring to, is something that arises *in regard to* or "on top of" the unpleasant feelings resulting even from mind (mano) contact, and that's why it's much subtler than people tend to think, and also why the freedom of sotāpatti is much deeper than people tend to think.

    Since "bodily feeling" also includes the feelings arising from mano, the mental displeasure resulting from losing a family member would also be a "bodily feeling". Not in the sense that it's a bodily *sensation* (or at least that part is irrelevant), but in the sense that it's still within the six senses that are to be seen as impermanent and impossible to own. And as every noble disciple, including the sotāpanna, [understands the cessation of the six sense base](https://suttacentral.net/mn9/en/bodhi?lang=en&reference=none&highlight=false), even that suffering would not affect them in the way it would a puthujjana.

    In other words, knowing the cessation *all* feeling (through the insight of paṭiccasamuppāda every sotāpanna has) is the same as knowing the way not suffer on account of bodily feeling—all feelings, even supramundane ones (nirāmisa), arise within the body, compared to guests arriving at a guest-house in [SN 36.14](https://suttacentral.net/sn36.14/en/bodhi?lang=en&reference=none&highlight=false)—, and thus experiencing no feeling in the *citta,* or second arrow. The second arrow is due to the attitude of ownership toward *whatever* feeling and toward the five aggregates in general (self-view), which is absent in a stream-enterer.

    &#x200B;

    >to my understanding, all that is attained in stream entry is noble view. in the absence of non-return, there would still be sensual desire, clinging and craving, and in the absence of arahantship, there would still be grief / sorrow, , clinging and craving.

    Yes, and that noble view includes both seeing the cessation and the way to the cessation of suffering. The main point is that if you *know* its cessation beyond doubt, you can't be said to be a "prey" to it in the way a puthujjana is, which was what I was illustrating with the comparison of the lion's den. It doesn't mean that for a sotāpanna, sorrow and grief don't *arise*, which can only be said for the Arahant, or for someone who is in the first jhāna ([faculty of dukkha ceases in the first jhāna](https://suttacentral.net/sn48.40/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=sidebyside&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin)). Those will arise for sure for as long as there is sensuality and aversion in the mind, but even *when* they arise, even the sotāpanna knows the way out of that suffering (meaning that *while* it's there, it's *experienced* as 7 grains of sand as opposed to a great mountain) which is why they may not necessarily feel an urge to abandon sensuality in this life, as evidenced by the stories of the attained lay followers in the Suttas.

    &#x200B;

    >The sotāpanna's mind does not experience, or only to a trifle amount, the suffering resulting from what would externally be the same amount of craving as an ordinary person.

    And that's what I meant with the above statement.

    >my understanding is that the extent of that sorrow / grief is a matter of kamma. some who have some inescapable kamma will suffer that grief according to that kamma.

    The problem with that idea is that it's a misunderstanding of what grief is. Grief (or dukkha to be more accurate) is there only if craving is there. So you can have done all the bad kamma in the world (case in point is Aṅgulimāla), and you will still be forced to experience disagreeable feelings on account of that even if you are an Arahant, but the difference is there will be no suffering in the mind. (To connect with what I wrote before, the feelings you would experience as results of your bad actions would always be *bodily* feelings, including all the mental discomfort of regret and remorse, because that pertains to the sixth sense base.)

    That's what AN 5.142 means, and the sotāpanna at least is the person who "understands the freedom by mind and freedom by understanding where those unbeneficial qualities cease without remainder", meaning they know how to not suffer even on account of things like regret and remorse when they arise. They experience only the first arrow of them.

    >my understanding of the okkanta samyutta is that they confer on the dhamma follower and faith follower the status of sappurisabhūmiṁ, but not ariyasāvaka.

    to my reading they are no longer puthujjanabhūmiṁ but they aren’t yet ariyasāvaka, though they are guaranteed to become so before they die.

    is that correct, or is there a sutta that directly states dhamma- and faith-followers are ariyasāvaka?

    the reason i think this is relevant is because the buddha states its only stream enterers and above who are guaranteed to end the cycle of birth and rebirth.

    Well, that would certainly lower the threshold of Dhamma and saddhānusari, and allow almost any serious practitioner to believe themselves to be one. But it would clearly contradict the Okkanta Saṃyutta, which states unequivocally that they are "incapable of dying until they experience the fruit of stream-entry" (translating literally from the Pāli).

    If such a person could fall from the path, the Buddha would be quite careless to state that they're incapable of not becoming stream-enterers, considering that the number of people who fall from the practice having taken it up is always much greater than those who actually achieve the results. I also mentioned MN 34, which explicitly says of the Dhamma- and saddhānusāri that they will cross over to safety, exactly the same as the other noble disciples.

    &#x200B;

    >elsewhere the buddha states something like “sometimes i see someone and i think they will never commit any wrong, but then i see that same person again and they have fallen from the path” (paraphrasing only and can’t recall sutta reference!).

    You might be referring to the Suttas in the Lābhasakkārasaṃyutta, e.g. SN 17.11, or AN 6.60. But none of that refers to what these two individuals have achieved, making them transcend the plane of puthujjanas (for which there is no in-between, it's either ariyasāvaka or puthujjana). And that achievement is, as I mentioned above,  *actually* seeing the Dhamma to the extent that they could at least put faith in ***it***, and not in something else.

    The type of person who can fall from the path is in fact named in AN 6.98, "anulomikāya khantiyā samannāgato", meaning one whose conviction is "along the grain" (anuloma). The *next* stage is "sammattaniyāmaṃ okkanto" and that is exactly the term that appears in the Okkanta Saṃyutta to describe the faith and Dhamma follower. That means "one who has entered upon the course of rightness", and that is the sotāpattimagga, the eighth noble individual, hence it says it's impossible to attain any of the fruits, including stream-entry, without reaching that stage.

    >It sounds like it's talking about an Arahant, not just any noble disciple.

    Yes, this is a common source of confusion.

    &#x200B;

    >If all noble disciples are "detached from rebirth, death, suffering", then where is the work? "?

    The work is in *steadying* themselves in that detachment. The "problem" for sekha is that they can become distracted from their own understanding, hence MN 1 encourages them to "not conceive". But that doesn't mean that they become puthujjanas when they get careless, it just means that there is some residue there left that is not present in an Arahant. That is as much as can be said. That's also why the Suttas always speak of sekhas in a positive light, that they don't conceive the aggregates as theirs, they don't delight in sensuality, they understand the origin and the cessation of everything, etc. What you see coming from the Buddha towards ariyasāvakas is only encouragements and advice, never the disapproval and critical attitude he shows towards puthujjanas.

    You could basically say that, instead of conceiving of the sotāpanna as a "better puthujjana", which is how people usually think of them, they must be seen as a "lesser Arahant", who has certain comparatively trifle habits left over (as the Buddha said, it's *wrong view* that is the foremost of all unwholesome qualities, not all the subtler things that are left for a sotāpanna—and yes, even the fetters that would make them live as householders enjoying sensual pleasures are trifle compared to the wrong view binds a puthujjana) that they must address in order to be completely steady in Nibbāna.

    So for example, in SN 36.6, that description of an ariyasāvaka needs to be understood as referring to one who is currently making effort to restrain those habits. But even the most heedless ariyasāvaka is *still* on an entirely different plane than the puthujjana, because the thing is they *can* not resist painful feelings, they *can* dispel the underlying tendency to repulsion, they *can* completely abandon any desire for sensuality, etc., even just momentarily *if they try* (and [continually doing that](https://suttacentral.net/sn48.50/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=sidebyside&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin) eventually makes those things never come back, and that's Arahantship; they become an Arahant permanently by continually making effort to be like an Arahant momentarily).

    A puthujjana, on the other hand, does not know how to not resist painful feelings without craving for sensuality, and here it must be understood that the puthujjana's idea of the pleasure of Nibbāna is always necessarily underlain by sensuality. Sensuality is much subtler than just the coarse pleasures of the five senses; it's a form of *being* (kāmabhava), as the Suttas say. And that's why a puthujjana who is free from sensuality would get to see Nibbāna almost instantaneously if they were to hear the Dhamma. The main obstacle that would lead them to misconceive it and miss the mark is gone.

    The principle of sensuality is simply that of having a "itch" and needing to scratch it. That "itch" can very well take the form of a desire to be enlightened.

    &#x200B;

    >What is the difference between being detached from rebirth and free from rebirth? Do the final stanzas also talk about non-arahants? Is it common that the suttas would say that non-arahants are "gone beyond rebirth"?

    Well, there's actually a mistranslation there (and everywhere else in those translations where that term occurs). The Pāli doesn't say "rebirth" (and that word doesn't exist in Pāli). It says *birth* (*jāti*).

    A sotāpanna is "detached from birth" because they see paṭiccasamuppāda, meaning they know the cessation of being (bhavanirodha) which is the cessation of birth (jātinirodha), and thus of also aging, death, sorrow, lamentation—the whole mass of suffering.

    Also, in the last line of the verse, where it says "gone beyond rebirth", that's another mistranslation. The Pāli is "**bhavassa** pāragū", meaning "gone beyond *being".* Sujato has chosen to translate both "bhava" and "jāti" as "rebirth" everywhere, causing total confusion.

    >however, i’m still not clear on whether the buddha ever states that a faith- or dhamma-follower is an ariyasavaka, or whether he always refers to them as sappurisabhumim.  
    >  
    >are you aware of any suttas where they are referred to as ariyasavakas? (it’s not inconsequential for me as i don’t wish to misrepresent what the buddha teaches).

    I am not aware of any specific Suttas, but I don't see why it would have to be explicitly stated. I haven't found any evidence or even suggestion in the Suttas that there could be someone who is neither puthujjana nor ariyasāvaka.

    The very common formula contrasting "assutavā puthujjana" with "sutavā ariyasāvaka", which is the main occurrence of the word ariyasāvaka, suggests that the "sappurisadhamma" is synonymous with "ariyadhamma", and that the puthujjana is defined by not being trained in either, and the ariyasāvaka the opposite. So I see no reason not to take the statement that the Dhamma and faith follower have ascended to the "sappurisabhūmi" and transcended the "puthujjanabhūmi" as equivalent to them being ariyasāvakas. Even if you were to translate ariyasāvaka as "disciple of the noble one(s)", that would still make saddhānusāri the minimum ariyasāvaka, as only at that point can one be said to have faith in the noble ones and their teaching, instead of a misrepresentation of that being mistakenly taken to be true.

    And, again, those who have reached sotāpatti-magga are the eighth type of individual comprising "bhagavato sāvakasaṅgho", the group of the Blessed One's disciples.

    Edit: SN 55.40 states that the one who does not possess the four factors of stream entry *at all* is called "an outsider, standing on the side of puthujjanas", and contrasts that with an ariyasāvaka explicitly. In SN 48.9, the faculty of faith is defined as faith in the Buddha's enlightenment, and MN 70 says that the saddhā and Dhammānusāri possess the five faculties.

    Thus, they do not *completely* lack the four factors of stream entry, and are ariyasāvakas under the definition of SN 55.40.

    Also, the corollary to that is that unless one is incapable of not attaining stream entry before death and of committing actions that would bring one to the lower planes (i.e. is a saddhā or Dhammānusāri /sotāpattimagga), one does not have the five faculties, including faith, as shown by SN 48.18 (which uses the same phrasing as SN 55.40) and implicitly by the other Suttas in that chapter as well.

    >in the other hand, for me, it makes sense that a being may be bound for noble discipleship, but not quite there yet.

    If this is the crux of why you feel the Dhamma and saddhānusāri cannot be ariyasāvakas, then even if there is no specific Sutta equating the two, what I've quoted so far is enough to prove the point that there is an unbridgeable divide between an ordinary person and  these two individuals.

    So even if the Buddha would not label them as ariyasāvakas (which, again, is the opposite of what the Suttas I've quoted at least strongly suggest even if not explicitly state), it would still undeniably be the case based on what the Buddha did explicitly say that the only one who would be "bound for noble discipleship", as you seem to define it, is a person who already has only 7 existences left (or even 8 for the sake of argument) and *cannot* die without experiencing the fruit of stream entry.

    Therefore, one would be well advised to assume to that one is nowhere near *neither* a faith or Dhamma follower *nor* much less an ariyasāvaka (if hypothetically they are different), and that either way one is still well within the puthujjanabhūmi.

    That is the only reason why this point is important, not the theoretical distinctions: so that one will not assume oneself to be in an elevated position of any kind, not even the minimum that is attributed to these two individuals, until one has *actually* become one of these two individuals at the very least, in the Buddha's definition of what they are.

    One will only reach the point one day where one *at least* puts faith in the right teaching correctly as the saddhānusāri does if one is willing to accept that as of yet, one still does not see what is and what is not Dhamma.  That is the only reasonable conclusion, unless one is bold enough to believe that one's stream-entry is already guaranteed. I think any sensible person would agree that that's not a wise attitude to have, though.

    >if the explicit formulation of ariyasāvaka in the suttas by the buddha doesn’t include them in it.

    Well, there is no "explicit formulation" of ariyasāvaka in the Suttas, apart from saying that it's the person who does see the Dhamma of the "sappurisas" and "ariyas" and is trained in it, and thus does not regard form as self, etc. If there Buddha were to list which types of people are ariyasāvakas explicitly, and did not include the two anusāris in that list, I would not even suggest that they are ariyasāvakas. But in the absence of such an explicit statement, and given that everything points towards them being the eighth type of noble individual, meaning the sotāpatti-magga attainer, one would actually need evidence to show that they are *not* ariyasāvakas if we define that as the eight types of noble individuals, and if such evidence were to exist, there would be a contradiction in the Suttas.

    &#x200B;

    >you seem to be positing a binary of either puthujjanabhumi or ariyasāvaka that doesn’t allow for something between them. is that correct?

    Indeed. And, most importantly, in the hypothetical event that there *were* such an "in-between" (which is not hinted at anywhere in the Suttas), the faith and Dhamma follower *cannot* be that in any meaningful sense. Whether one classifies them as ariyasāvakas or not is actually not relevant; at the very least, they are *guaranteed* to become ariyasāvakas, which cannot be said for the puthujjana, who is still liable to the underworld and endless wandering in saṃsāra, does not possess the five faculties, and neither sees nor is guaranteed to see the Dhamma.

    So if there *were* an in-between state apart from these two individuals who are already destined to safely cross over to the far shore as said in MN 34, it would have to be someone who *isn't* destined to do so, and thus there would be hardly any benefit in being conferred that title as opposed to that of puthujjana. It would be redundant, and the Buddha would have no reason for even mentioning it.

    >however consistent with what i’ve suggested above, it seems the buddha is explicitly drawing a line here between these kinds of ariyasāvaka who are not yet stream enterer, and the event of stream entry. this supports the separation of sotāpanna and dhammānusāri / saddhānusāri as distinct and separate types of ariyasāvaka.  
    >  
    >consistent with what he states in the okkanta samyutta, dhammānusāri / saddhānusāri then are not yet stream enterers but they will eventually be.

    Certainly. The Okkantasaṃyutta draws a clear distinction at the very end for the one who "understands and sees these things", which is the sotāpanna. Most importantly, these two pre-sotāpatti individuals are not free from doubt and the first three fetters in general yet even though they 100% will be eventually, so it's not like they would *know* that they are no longer puthujjanas even though they aren't, and they would lack the confidence a sotāpanna has (including in the Triple Gem, as the "unshakable faith" is acquired only by the stream enterer, as stated in SN 55.24). SN 48.12 also states that they have weaker faculties (but they *have them;* a puthujjana doesn't).

    >re-reading your comments above, an55.40 supports the idea that a dhammānusāri / saddhānusāri could “utterly lack the four factors of stream entry” and would then be on the side of the “puthujjanapakkhe”. this appears to clearly indicate that there is a continuum from puthujjana to sotapanna, and supports the notion that a dhammānusāri / saddhānusāri can very specifically an ariyasāvaka, but still on the side of the puthujjana.

    I don't see why you would come to that conclusion. I see it as clearly indicating the opposite, since the faith and Dhamma follower are the ones who have acquired the five faculties, the first of which is defined as faith in the Buddha in SN 48.11. So they don't *completely* lack the four factors of stream entry, whereas whatever a person who is not destined for stream entry has faith in is by definition *not* the Buddha and his teaching, but a misunderstanding of them that appears to them to be right.

    This idea would also clearly contradict the Okkanta Saṃyutta, which says that the faith and Dhamma follower have transcended the plane of puthujjanas.

    One must assume that the Buddha would not contradict himself; otherwise, the Suttas falsely *seem* to allow for different interpretations.

    &#x200B;

    >these types of ariyasāvaka don’t have the fetters of stream entry broken - they might not have complete faith in the buddha yet (thought they might have faith with certain doubts).

    Yes, but they are ariyasāvakas who are practicing the right way, and are the "unsurpassed field of merit for the world". Or even if you argue they aren't, they are guaranteed to become that, in stark contrast with the vast majority of practitioners.

    The reason why I find it important to disprove what you're putting forth is that it allows people to find undeserved contentment with their practice and likely end up overestimating themselves eventually, by assuming that their faith and intellectual agreement with the Dhamma, and whatever other qualities they might have developed are definitely on the "right" side of the spectrum, and that when the Buddha talks about "trained noble disciple" in the Suttas, that they can consider that to pertain to them, and that when he talks about the "uninstructed puthujjana" they can assume themselves *not* to be in that category, much to their own detriment. They will eventually end up in the perilous position described in MN 105.

    The only way to actually become a noble disciple is to never assume that one's practice is correct, and always be striving to upgrade it—even fully go back to square one no matter how many years one has been practicing, if one finds contradictions in one's views. That is surely more unpleasant, but if one doesn't do that, one is almost guaranteed to settle for less than the real thing.

    In fact, since as I said above, the faith and Dhamma follower don't *know* that they are noble disciples and are destined for sotāpatti, they would necessarily still be regarding themselves as puthujjanas, as they have no confirmation of their attainment. So what is then to be said of someone who may well not be destined for enlightenment like they are, and already wants to find a way to not consider themselves to be in the lowest possible category? The temptation is too irresistible for many people these days.

    &#x200B;

    >i’m not that familiar with the notions of path and fruit but perhaps what the buddha’s doing here is drawing a line between those who have entered into the path to stream entry with right view of impermanence, and those who have attained the fruit of stream entry with that view consummated into noble view.

    Yes, and those who "have entered into the path of stream entry with right view of permanence" will only be reborn a maximum number of times already, meaning nobody in their right mind should assume themselves to be there yet, and should instead take themselves to simply be puthujjanas. They should only come to the conclusion that they are stream enterers once the second arrow of suffering cannot touch them anymore, which is how they know for sure they are ariyasāvakas as per SN 36.6, not when they have become skilled at outrunning the second arrow through various management strategies.

    SN 48.37 divides dukkha into two categories: "dukkha" as bodily unpleasant feeling and "domanassa" as mental unpleasant feeling. SN 48.32 then says that the sotāpanna knows as they really are the origin, ending, gratification and escape from both. Then, the Arahant in SN 48.33, having known all these things, is *also* liberated through non-clinging, which is the what the sotāpanna hasn't achieved yet.

    >I'm not sure if this is a starting point for your thinking, but it occurs to me that mn121 only states that the six sense bases are "dependent" on this body, but do not define the body as just the sense bases.

    No, that's the ubiquitous (mis)translation. The Pāli is:

    >‘ye assu darathā kāmāsavaṁ paṭicca tedha na santi, ye assu darathā bhavāsavaṁ paṭicca tedha na santi, ye assu darathā avijjāsavaṁ paṭicca tedha na santi, atthi cevāyaṁ darathamattā yadidaṁ—  
    >  
    >**imameva kāyaṁ paṭicca saḷāyatanikaṁ** jīvitapaccayā’ti.

    Literal translation: "The disturbances dependent on the influx of sensuality, being, and ignorance are not here; there is only this extent of disturbance—(the disturbance) dependent on this *six-based body*, conditioned by life."

    I suspect translators skew the rendering because of the common view that the body "disappears" during meditation while the six sense base is always there (a contradiction), but the Pāli is very clear. "saḷāyatanika" is an adjective qualifying "kāya" because it's also in the same case.

    The usual "disturbance connected with the six sense bases dependent on this body" would correspond to "imameva kāyanissitaṃ salāyatanaṃ paṭicca" or similar in Pali. Big difference.

    &#x200B;

    >in this sense, the second arrow just refers to the proliferation of physical pain into mental pain. to my understanding, it's this that a noble disciple can evade. i can't conceive of any mental feelings beyond what the buddha describes in the suttas that mental pain can refer to. and here in the salla sutta, it seems to only refer to that proliferation of physical to mental. it's not saying however that noble disciples are free from mental pain at all.

    The thing is, even if we were to put all the Suttas aside for a moment, how does it make sense that noble disciple is defined by just being able to endure bodily sensations? Moreover, what does it mean to say that they "don't proliferate bodily pain into mental pain"?

    My first guess is that for you that means that they experience only a "bare perception" of the physical sensation, and that they are able to not add a mental "narrative" to it. If that's the case, the Suttas are clear that that's not how experience works.  They are explicit on how the perceptions and feelings that arise at the six sense base are not in one's control, even mentioning that they are Māra's range of influence. So it would not make sense to say that a noble disciple's achievement is in controlling what belongs to Māra (preventing feelings from arising at *mano*), as the Buddha always says that *relinquishing* what belongs to Māra is the way to liberation.

    Furthermore, as I already pointed out, the term translated as "mental suffering" in the Arrow Sutta (and SN 48.37 also) is "cetasika dukkha", and that alone shows that it's not about the sixth sense base, which is not *citta* but *mano.* That distinction is the crux of it all.

    The main problem with this view is that anyone who is able to use secondary management methods and meditation techniques to suppress their thoughts and "prevent proliferation" when they experience physical pain, and often experience some sort of meditative bliss or another on account of it, can come to think that they're an ariyasāvaka and have gone beyond the second arrow, whereas the Buddha is describing something way more profound than that, made clear by how the it says that as a result of that lack of a second arrow, the noble disciple is "detached from birth, aging and death, from *sorrow, lamentation ... sadness, distress*" (which are clearly mental, stated explicitly in the case of sadness/domanassa in MN 10).

    I should also add that there is yet another mistake of translation. Sujato has added a "physical" into the "dukkha" of SN 36.6 which is not there in the Pali, suggesting that he may hold a similar view to what you're describing, and misleading those who read this into it too.

    The Pāli is:

    >Evameva kho, bhikkhave, sutavā ariyasāvako **dukkhāya vedanāya** phuṭṭho samāno na socati, na kilamati, na paridevati, na urattāḷiṁ kandati, na sammohaṁ āpajjati.  
    >  
    >So ekaṁ vedanaṁ vedayati—  
    >  
    >kāyikaṁ, na cetasikaṁ.

    What this is saying is that when a noble disciple experiences *any* kind of *dukkha*, for them there is only the bodily aspect, not the mental (citta) aspect. And this is what fits perfectly with all the other statements of the same Sutta, such as that they understand the origin, ending, gratification, danger, and escape from feeling *in general*, and what I already mentioned regarding being detached from birth, aging, sickness, death, sorrow, lamentation, etc., which are the categories of suffering that always occur description of the first noble truth. The displeasure of all these things is primarily mental, not physical.

    The translation (or more like interpretation) skews it into "when they experience *physical* pain, there is only the bodily aspect." Again, big difference.

    My point is that those are *not* the literal words of the Sutta. you're still reading the "physical painful sensation arises, then mental pain comes after" concept into it, which I've heard many times before, but that is not what it's saying (except when mistranslated). If you interpret vedanā as "sensations", which is a common mistake contemporarily, that would no doubt explain the misreading of the Sutta.

    The Pāli doesn't say that there is an "initial ***physical*** painful ***sensation***" at all, it says that there is a general unpleasant feeling (dukkhā vedanā), and that the puthujjana then experiences that *twice,* once in the body and once in the mind (*citta*, which means it's not about "mental proliferation" of ideas and concepts, which you agreed is how you interpret it. "Mental fabrication" is an affair of mano, not citta which is the term that appears, which is why I said the distinction is crucial). 

    See SN 22.1 on how alterations in *any* of the five aggregates are considered "bodily" (kāya), whereas it's the attitude of appropriation of the aggregates that leads to being "afflicted in mind" (citta). And kāya and citta are the terms used in the Arrow Sutta, whereas in the context of enduring **physical** pain, it's always "**sārīrīkā** dukkhā vedanā", not "kāyika", such as in SN 1.38 which you quoted. Putting up with physical pain is part of a noble disciples training as said in MN 2, but it's by no means what distinguishes them from a puthujjana. It's a secondary line of development in the grand scheme of things.

    &#x200B;

    Furthermore, thinking that the first arrow is about *physical sensations* trivializes the Arrow Sutta, and does not at all explain why the Buddha is saying that the noble disciple is detached from *sorrow, lamentation, birth, aging, sickness, death,* and even *being,* instead of just stating that they're detached from physical sensations (which is comparatively a trifle achievement). Your interpretation is also at odds with the statement that on account of that dukkha, the puthujjana seeks gratification in sensuality. People don't seek sensual pleasures on account of painful *physical sensations*, but always on account of pain in the six sense base in general (stress from work, disappointments, bad moods, etc.)

    All those mental things like disappointments, loss, anxiety, *as well as* physical pain, are what the first arrow is, and the noble disciple does not experience a second arrow on top of that.

    At the end of the day, nobody stands to gain anything from interpreting the first arrow as physical pain, as it just waters down what an ariyasāvaka is, allowing puthujjanas to think they're ariyasāvakas because they're free from something which wasn't the second arrow to begin with, but just a particular instance of the first (the mental pain on account of physical pain which they can suppress on a particular basis), not realizing that *overall*, the second arrow is very much still there.

### Lack of samvega

I have been lying to myself that I am "practicing" for more than a year. I kind of determined that this teaching is something that is something that is least likely to be wrong in whatever things I have read into. The only part left was applying the medicine.

But all this time, I couldn't even establish precepts and sense restraint properly. And this isn't just a slip back here and there but the same sensuality that I delighted in early back, I keep delighting in it even now. In the retrospect, I have gained a lot of theoretical knowledge and wrapped my head somehow around it but honestly I am in the literal same place as I was. The mind is still just as easily disturbed.

When I tried looking into what is wrong with me, I couldn't even discern my reasons behind why did I take up the dhamma practice. I can't even discern that I have an illness. It's not like I am not bothered by things - recently, something permanently affected one of my tooth and I was deeply affected and anxious due to it. Initially I was able to put this into the context that this is really the nature of suffering and that I really need to put efforts. It worked for sometime but then that thing got psychologized and it no more feels threatening. It doesn't help that certain good worldly things have been happening in my life that blind me even more. I feel hopeless that I will ever be able to take upon the practice as if my life depends even though I intellectually believe it very much does.

In short, I have been fooling myself and don't have the samvega necessary for the practice. Is there anything I can do so that I constantly "feel" the weight of existence?

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/18mb67z/lack_of_samvega/ke5jwi5/)** _2023-12-20 07:47:39:

    Firstly, you want to make sure that your reasons for taking up the practice are clear, because that's the only thing that will keep you going when inspiration fades (which will have to happen because that's just another arisen experience). Try to recognize what the Buddha meant with "being prey to suffering", which is the realization that left people back in the day no choice *but* to take up the practice. It's not the fact that you *are* suffering right now, nor that there are any specific events that you know will cause you suffering in the future. It's the fact that *if* something intensely unpleasant where to happen, you know that you will suffer on account of it, and that possibility looms greater the more pleasures and acquisitions the mind depends on (the higher you go, the harder you will eventually fall, when death comes at the very latest).

    Having said that, it's not about constantly *trying* to feel the weight of existence, because if that weight is being felt "on your own terms", meaning you are the one bringing it about, it will not be felt on the right level. It will be weighing on where you can carry it, so to speak, because you're fabricating it volitionally. 

    You would "feel the weight" on the right level by recognizing how you *can't* get yourself to feel it all the time, and how the urge to practice comes and goes on its own. That will make you see how you can't even rely on your own moods to aid your practice, and that even that which is closest to you—your own mind—is actually doing it's own thing, not really for your best interest most of the time.

    The "weight" needs to be felt on the level of the uncertainty of not being able to get what you want, no matter what that is, including the desire to "feel the weight".

### Difference between ordinary people and noble disciple

Hello, [here in this talk](https://youtu.be/gkwYOroXqK0?si=NAv2_WE-VzQ86N8s&t=300) Venerable Nyanamoli addresses the subject of the two arrows simile explaining the difference between puthujjana and ariya, the later not suffering on the level of the mind when suffering on the level of the body, while puthujjana does.

&#x200B;

When reading this sutta I always thought "bodily suffering" referred to an unpleasant feeling at the level of touch (hurting), sight (too bright), earing (too loud), taste (too disgusting), smell (too stinky), but I didn't consider it could also be at the level of the mind.

And I would like your help to clarify if I correctly understood what Ajahn Nyanamoli said and to better understand what's happening in the following example he gave:

&#x200B;

One is seeing someone (or it could be something) they don't like and they feel anger or anxiety on account of seeing them/it. **The ariya knowing the sight pertains to something unownable is not struck by that second arrow.**

Here do I understand correctly that the first arrow would be only seeing someone/something **I don't like**, while the second arrow would be feeling anger or anxiety on account of it?

&#x200B;

(1) So here the first arrow would be only the sight which pertains to the eyes, while the second arrow would be the feeling on the level of the mind that arise as a reaction to that sight.

What I don't understand then is: why should the sight be felt as an arrow in the first place, isn't it only unpleasant because it is a sight of something **I don't like,** unpleasant because of the feeling on the level of the mind arising because of the reaction to that sight? If there was only the sight without the reaction ("I don't like") there would be no place for unpleasant feeling (meaning no first arrow)?

&#x200B;

(2) Which lead me to question my understanding: could the first arrow rather be feeling anger or anxiety on account of seeing someone/something I don't like, while the second arrow would be resisting that unpleasant feeling (anger or anxiety) and suffering because there is now an unpleasant feeling and I don't want it and don't know what to do about it for it to subside?

Or could there be 3 arrows in this case (the sight, the reaction to the sight, the reaction to the reaction of the sight)?

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/18lxugh/difference_between_ordinary_people_and_noble/ke5fr3c/)** _2023-12-20 06:57:02:

    &#x200B;

    >(1) So here the first arrow would be only the sight which pertains to the eyes, while the second arrow would be the feeling on the level of the mind that arise as a reaction to that sight.

    What I don't understand then is: why should the sight be felt as an arrow in the first place, isn't it only unpleasant because it is a sight of something I don't like, unpleasant because of the feeling on the level of the mind arising because of the reaction to that sight? If there was only the sight without the reaction ("I don't like") there would be no place for unpleasant feeling (meaning no first arrow)?

    Yes, there is a contradiction there, which is how you know that can't be right. The fact that the Buddha is calling it an "arrow" means it *is* unpleasant, so one must keep that as one's starting point. Often people's idea of Arahantship is inadvertently that there is *no* arrow, precisely because the ignorant mind sees no way to not suffer on account of a feeling other than *not having it at all.* When one gets to see how there can be the full extent of feeling without suffering, one understands the Four Noble Truths. Before that point, one's idea of the ending of suffering necessitates, whether one realizes it or not, the ending of *unpleasant feelings*.

    And that is what the "first arrow" is. Take *any* experience of feeling, [whether past, future, or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near](https://suttacentral.net/sn22.59/en/bodhi?lang=en&reference=none&highlight=false) and see that as that which is given on its own. The "second arrow" is, in simple terms, due to the ownership of feelings, meaning that the mind feels a sense of entitlement to any degree towards what is felt. If it's pleasant, it feels entitled to get more and suffers if it can't, and if it's unpleasant, it feels entitled to get less and suffers if it can't. If it's neutral, it feels entitled to distract itself with something more engaging and suffers if it can't.

    And this is where the Gradual Training comes in. Only by *actually* going through that development of one's behavior can one eventually get to see the sheer "size" of what feeling is. Otherwise, one will be confusing the extent of the "entitlement" with the extent of the feeling, and one's only conception of an escape from the situation will be to get rid of the feeling, and that's what most contemporary Buddhist practices revolve around.

    &#x200B;

    >(2) Which lead me to question my understanding: could the first arrow rather be feeling anger or anxiety on account of seeing someone/something I don't like, while the second arrow would be resisting that unpleasant feeling (anger or anxiety) and suffering because there is now an unpleasant feeling and I don't want it and don't know what to do about it for it to subside?

    It depends on the situation and in what direction one's ignorance is going at the moment. There will be times when one will be confusing what is just the first arrow of an unpleasant feeling (which naturally comes with associated perceptions and intentions) with anger or anxiety when it's not (e.g. perceiving someone as a useless fool is not *necessarily* anger, as exemplified by the Buddha all over the Suttas) . Other times, one will be missing the mark by thinking that everything is the first arrow and not recognizing one's unwholesome attitudes that factually have to be abandoned. So that's why it's essential to keep questioning one's understanding and not think that it's correct, because both of these wrong views can give rise to "pleasant results"  that people  would mistake to be a sign of progress.

    So the only way to start getting it right reliably is to learn how to see the full *extent* of one's feelings (which is where the "endurance" we talk about comes in, and it's also what the oft-mentioned sign of the mind is). Only then can one get to see for oneself where the feeling "ends" and where one's gratuitous entitlement "begins".

### If I can't have angry thoughts without an angry mind, am I all the time angry ?

Well if something makes me suddenly angry, let's say my son broke something I care about, anger swells up. But as Ajahn says, the anger was already there ! Does it mean that anger, lust and so forth are all the time already there and they just rise up in the mind depending on external triggers ?

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/18kd1ok/if_i_cant_have_angry_thoughts_without_an_angry/kdqo3zq/)** _2023-12-17 11:06:35:

    >Does it mean that anger, lust and so forth are all the time already there and they just rise up in the mind depending on external triggers ?

    What the statement "you can't have angry thoughts without an angry mind" is pointing towards is the discernment of simultaneous dependence in regard to the experience of anger.  Instead of trying to get rid of the thoughts at face value which is what people usually do, one should recognize the state of mind affected with anger, and learn to deal with that on the right level, meaning enduring it and not resisting the discomfort that comes from it. (See [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XMDbO8JLvo&ab_channel=HillsideHermitage)).

    Since that is the true root of the angry thoughts, their simultaneous "nutriment", it is impossible for them to continue to be there if the angry state of mind has been properly overcome in that way (through right endurance).

    But this will only make sense if one has recognized that the significances and perceptions of "this is unpleasant" or "this person is foolish" are not in themselves what constitutes an angry thought, as those will continue to arise even when there is no angry mind. The angry thoughts are on the level of your specific mental *actions* towards the significance of "this is unpleasant", of wishing another person harm or bitterly thinking over what you should have done to prevent this or that from happening. The angry mind is just the overall mood that inclines towards such actions and thoughts, so when an angry mind is left unchecked and allowed to grow, angry thoughts will come to the surface accordingly.

    One must learn to recognize one's state of mind so that one can see oneself proliferating it through little intentions and carelessness here and there when it's still not as strong, instead of recognizing what's going on only later once the coarse lustful and hateful thoughts are already coming up at full force and one is overwhelmed. That is usually the late stage at which people recognize their defilements, and address them wrongly with all sorts of secondary management methods to boot, never really getting to the root of the issue.

    >the anger or ill-will mind-state would be the dhamma

    No, in this case the mind-state would be the saṅkhāra—that which is determining the thoughts as angry thoughts. Because you could literally have exactly the same thoughts on another occasion, no matter their content, when there is no angry mind state and you would never call them "angry thoughts". So the mind state is what determines those thoughts for what they are, and by seeing that simultaneous dependence, you realize that you have no ultimate say neither in the mental state nor the thoughts, and that's how you eventually "uproot" (ownership of) the angry mind without wasting time with that which is secondary as people usually would (replacing the *content* of thoughts with attention to bodily sensations or thoughts or loving-kindness, etc., as if the content was the problem).

    Once the angry mind is not being taken up through discernment, it will have to fade eventually (because looking past it and focusing on the thoughts is how it gets nourished). Then whatever you think about will be impossible to involve anger, even if it's "that person is a complete idiot". That's why you often see the Buddha in the Suttas making such statements, without any trace of anger.

### Nāmarūpa-viññāna Viññāna-nāmarūpa

Hello, [in the latest video](https://youtu.be/lGJ7YTtsHhs&t=2074) Ajahn Nyanamoli talks about the knowledge of the simultaneity of two things and the dependence of those two things in the sotapanna's insight, and he finishes with : "Nāmarūpa-viññāna Viññāna-nāmarūpa dependence from paticcasamuppada still remains in an arahant".

&#x200B;

I think I also remember Venerable Anigha saying that Viññāna-nāmarūpa constitute one's all world, the entirety of one's experience, but I'm not sure how accurate is this memory.

&#x200B;

That's probably wrong but that's why I'm asking the questions:

Is Viññāna-nāmarūpa one's all world and is this exactly pointing at those simultaneous elements that Ajahn Nyanamoli advises puthujjanas to work on, namely what is (or is taken as) the sense of self and what is simultaneously there enduring on its own on which the sense of self depends?

So is nāmarūpa everything that is simultaneously enduring there, while viññāna is what is "attending to it while not attending to it"?

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/18jnd44/nāmarūpaviññāna_viññānanāmarūpa/kdpzz4j/)** _2023-12-17 05:58:58:

    >So is nāmarūpa everything that is simultaneously enduring there, while viññāna is what is "attending to it while not attending to it"?

    &#x200B;

    More like, through learning to practice yoniso manasikāra, one gets to recognize the indirect nature of viññāṇa (which is not an "object" that you just "observe"; that's exactly the sort of attitude that needs to be abandoned). By having the simultaneous recognition of two phenomena, which together form the totality of your experience, there is no room for "something else" there, meaning the sense of "I am".
- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/18jnd44/nāmarūpaviññāna_viññānanāmarūpa/kdqmh8r/)** _2023-12-17 10:44:27 *(in reply to a comment not included)*:

    Yes, taking on the attitude of "observation" of objects entails taking on a saṅkhāra in a manner that is oblivious to itself. Meaning one cannot at the same time know what is simultaneously "beneath" one's attention as discussed in the video and  be observing objects with that attention, even if those objects are subtler and more complex, like when people think they're *seeing* the arising and ceasing of their aggregates or whatever on the level of perceptions.

    All of that is just watching nāmarūpa, unaware of the simultaneous enduring of viññāṇa which can't be discerned on that observational level, and because of that the actual view of self and appropriation remain.
- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/18jnd44/nāmarūpaviññāna_viññānanāmarūpa/kdv1r2a/)** _2023-12-18 06:45:38 *(in reply to a comment not included)*:

    The general principle is that of seeing one's experience as a whole (nāmarūpa in this specific case, which includes anything that can manifest) being dependent on something else (viññāṇa). 

    The principle is what matters, so you could take something as simple as your total experience of sense objects (which also constitute the entire world, internal and external) being dependent on your sense organs, which are lumps of matter existing in the world that cannot be guaranteed to remain functional any more than a branch can be prevented from falling off a tree. 

    By seeing that anything you call "my self" will be either within the domain of sense objects or within the domain of the sense organs, it becomes clear that appropriation is a mistake (not that "the self does not exist"; rather, it's a mistake, and mistakes are real as such).

### Understanding Peripheral Awareness

I've been trying my best to comprehend how to practice peripheral awareness, and I would really appreciate any pointers from the community.  I'll outline how I understand it below.

&#x200B;

Essentially, the knowledge of the basis of your situation, as it endures, is totally outside of the sensory realm.  So you can't just attend that knowledge, if you think you are,  you are just attending the image of the knowledge while remaining within its basis.  So the knowledge that you are seated will endure really no matter what on its own level, because it is within its own unseeable realm.  However, its existence on its own is not consequential without awareness, with awareness it shapes all that is within the awareness.  Awareness on its own is also outside of the sensory realm, it's just a different type of knowledge - anything that represents the awareness is just a separate image on its own.  This is obviously deviating from what has been overtly said in the talks but it's just my anecdotally-derived idea of how it works as I understand it now and I want it to be torn apart.

&#x200B;

So the question is how do you actually maintain that awareness of the knowledge, and on what level, to what extent?  When I know that I'm breathing or sitting, and I try to maintain the image of the awareness of that, it is either represented by a sensual object (ie, a thought or a particular sensation / pressure you associate with that "thing") or it is quickly overtaken by the churning of other phenomena occurring on account of the body.

&#x200B;

I'm having a hard time discerning at what level something is actually being attended to or not - mental objects evolve and unravel right in front of me and it feels exactly the same whether I think I'm attending it or not.  Widening my area of attention so to speak is just an iteration of the same thing. This awareness of knowledge of basis seems like it needs to be attended or maintained on some level.  When I try to attend it, I'm just attending sensuality.  When I loosen up, it vanishes.  What is the middle point here?  From the talks and essay the awareness really seems to be beyond sensuality.

One idea I've been playing with is that perhaps it's continuously applying the awareness to what has arisen that maintains the awareness of knowledge.  So for instance a feeling of tightness is present in the head.  You understand even without really needing to think that this tightness has arisen on account of the body, within the sensory realm.  But it takes a second, you have to kind of step back, notice that you are perceiving it in an unskillful way (because it hurts!) and then view it within the context.  And then it really doesn't require anything more unless you go and overwrite that context in regard to that object that you attended for some period of time.

Sorry if this post doesn't make a ton of sense, it's kind of hard to bring experience into words in this way, I understand peripheral awareness from a high level but it's these nuances in practice that make it difficult to really understand on a moment-to-moment basis as it really is.  So it makes sense as an abstraction but I can tell that I don't really get it where it counts.

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/18hxzpy/understanding_peripheral_awareness/kdaj1u5/)** _2023-12-14 06:58:18:

    What is sounds like is that you are inadvertently still turning peripheral awareness into a sense object by trying to tell yourself that it shouldn't be one. That's what the "peripheral" aspect refers to—it always has to do with what you are doing and the background implications of your attention to this or that here and now, so even if you are following the instructions verbatim, if peripherally you are not aware of how your mind is "looking with restlessness" towards this very practice you are doing, that's lacking peripheral awareness. What is peripheral is never "fixed"; it's the underlying basis of your situation here and now, often in the direction of "why am I doing/attending this?".

    In this case, instead of trying to *figure out* peripheral awareness and trying do "apply it" in an almost systematic way, you would be much closer to it by suspending the whole project on that "I am doing this" level, and catching that underlying pressure towards "figuring out" as a subtle phenomenon that is *real as such*. That's the key phrase always. It's not that the context is "outside" of the sensual realm in some esoteric sense, but that it entails a clarified recognition of things that are there and have always been there, but that one *overlooks* when one's attention is by default running along with the pull of sense objects. In this case, the thoughts about figuring out what peripheral awareness would *also* be sense objects. Only the knowledge of that pressure that results from not acting out of it can truly be said to not partake in that nature.

    That's why the only to *both* accurately wrap your head around and further cultivate peripheral awareness is virtue and sense restraint. When your mind is pressuring you towards some sense object, and mentally on the level of doubt, towards revisiting and redefining your Dhamma knowledge again and again, your intention to not act out of the pressure without trying to deny its presence constitutes peripheral awareness whether you're aware of it or not (and yes, it's another intention but on a different level, which is why it's not "out of this world" or something; the intention to give in to pressures is equally peripheral, in fact, so everyone is in a sense already practicing "peripheral awareness" always since that's the nature of the mind, just in the completely wrong direction and without recognizing it).

    That same principle you just expand towards everything else. Whether it's body postures, feelings, moods, or whatever, it needs to be used as a way to not be fully engaged with whatever movements are there in your experience here and now on the level of the six senses. That "not being fully engaged" in itself is what peripheral awareness is, not some (foreground) nuance of you directing your attention like this or like that, measuring how much is background and how much is foreground, etc., which is the direction one will tend to go initially due to the untamed habits of attention.

    That's why when the mind is tamed, peripheral awareness is always there even without making an effort. Not because you "strengthened it like a muscle", but because you by default don't get baited by whatever is happening in the six sense domain, so it's effortless. But yes, to get to that point, one must cultivate that attitude and keep trying to better understand it through concrete practices like the satipaṭṭhānas.

    No, sati isn't exactly the same as peripheral awareness, but sammāsati is right *because* of peripheral awareness/yoniso manasikāra.

    As I wrote [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/187s9ba/comment/kbif492/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), everyone has sati/recollection/memory already. But knowing how to recollect the relevant phenomena peripherally is what turns it into sammāsati. That's why seeing the signs of the mind and the Right View are necessary for the practice to be right. As MN 2 says, there is no abandoning of defilements for one who does not recognize yoniso *and* ayoniso  manasikāra (i.e. knowing right recollection as right and wrong recollection as wrong).

### What are the light and visions of forms talked about in MN 128 ?

Well my question is pretty straightforward. We have in MN 128 (upakkilesasutta) a long passage discussing light and visions during meditations, here is an example :

“Good, good, Anuruddha and friends! But as you live diligently like this, have you achieved any superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones, a meditation at ease?”

“Well, sir, while meditating diligent, keen, and resolute, we perceive both light and vision of forms. But before long the light and the vision of forms vanish. We haven’t worked out the reason for that.”

“Well, you should work out the reason for that. Before my awakening—when I was still unawakened but intent on awakening—I too perceived both light and vision of forms. But before long my light and vision of forms vanished. It occurred to me: ‘What’s the cause, what’s the reason why my light and vision of forms vanish?’ It occurred to me: ‘Doubt arose in me, and because of that my immersion fell away. When immersion falls away, the light and vision of forms vanish. I’ll make sure that doubt will not arise in me again.’

The way it's framed though, make it seem like the light and visions of forms are a good thing that may disappear on account of various mental faults. It also reminds me of the orthodox understanding of the nimitta. Any idea how we should interpret it ?

### Interesting parallel between sensuality and smoking addiction

Recently watched [Why did the Buddha say "sensuality" to be an assumption?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNotZXYWV-0)

One very interesting parallel of the talk is to Allen Carr's book on quitting smoking (Easy Way to Stop Smoking).  In that book he talks about the addicted cigarette smoker facing two monsters to overcome the addiction:  the Big Monster which is in charge of brainwashing, and the Little Monster which gives you cravings.

The crux of the book is in addressing the brainwashing.  The addicted smoker believes that the relief from the last cigarette is truly pleasurable, when it's simply the relieving of the craving for nicotine.  Because if it were truly pleasurable, then a smoker would derive pleasure even if they kept smoking incessantly without taking breaks in between, etc..  So, it's not really about pleasure, but topping up one's nicotine level to make up for the withdrawal induced by the last cigarette.  It's like purposely tying your shoelaces too tight because you enjoy the sensation of loosening them.  Therefore, the key to counter the brainwashing is to fully dispel the illusion of seeing the cigarette as desirable (in fact, in the book it suggests the reader to not stop smoking until they fully understand this point).

Obviously, the approach to sensuality is much, much broader in context, but I find the parallels to be rather astounding.  In that one needs to develop proper understanding and maintain the right context of sensuality being driven by the pain of craving (on top of the prerequisites of sense restraint, precepts, etc.), or else true dispassion will never develop.

    The reason why we say that one must learn to *endure* the pressure of sensuality and not try to immediately get rid of those thoughts is because that's the only way one will get to address the actual "brainwashing" part, meaning the *view/assumption* that scratching the sensual itch is truly pleasant.

    If the cigarette addict were to just distract themselves with something else so that they forget about the desire to smoke, they wouldn't get to understand the real reason why the addiction should be given up, no matter how painful the withdrawal gets (or rather *because* of how painful it is). One day, even if it's many months later, they will end up smoking again once the secondary management approaches (meditation techniques and "observation" practices) stop working well enough, and it's the same with sensuality.

    That's what the Buddha meant by saying one needs to understand the gratification, danger, and *then* the escape from sensuality, but people are often just focused on getting the escape ASAP, which in the end means it's not an escape at all, but just sweeping the issue under the rug (like when your meditation is about getting rid of thinking and pondering, through which the the "itch" of sensuality is felt). And one can only come to understand the gratification and danger by enduring the pressure of the thoughts without acting out of it.

### Sotapanna's insight

Hello, in the latest video [Venerable Nyanamoli says](https://youtu.be/i5teUsZUSk0?t=1002): Sotapanna (and Ariya for that matter) knows all for all because he knows that "whatever has the nature to manifest, its manifestation is its ending, manifestation caries its end, **because it came on its own**".

As for the first part I don't really have an issue understanding that whatever manifested, because of its manifestation, that implies it is of impermanent nature, this is I believe what the Buddha taught with Anicca.

(1) Where it didn't click for me is the "because it came on its own", I'm sure it underlies and carries meaningful informations but the meaning is nebulous to me, what does it mean and implies?

&#x200B;

Also we are taught Sotapanna doesn't (and shouldn't) *conceive*, rather he knows, *conceiving* is explained in this manner (I hope I didn't miss further explanations of it):

\- [Here](https://youtu.be/i5teUsZUSk0?t=557) that phenomena are perceived as separate/independent, failing to understand the very sense of self assuming them as separate is undermined by these phenomena (dependent upon those phenomena (as well as the body) as a foundation for its existence??)

\- [Here](https://youtu.be/i5teUsZUSk0?t=931) that phenomena are not perceived as permanent, but known as impermanent through their manifestation

&#x200B;

(2) Does *conceiving* here solely means what has been listed (and what could be derived from these points)?

&#x200B;

I'm thinking for example about phenomena's nature of being unownable (which I believe a Sotapanna would *know*), this is something I came accross multiple times in insightful messages on this sub and I'm failing to recognize it for sure in this list.

But I'm also thinking maybe it can be derived from the first point: because the sense of self is dependent upon these phenomena (as well as the body) as a foundation for its very existence, it makes this sense of self unable to be the owner of this body, or of these phenomena; as well as the idea that phenomena are manifested through and only through the body, which is unownable, rendering them unownable.

    >(1) Where it didn't click for me is the "because it came on its own", I'm sure it underlies and carries meaningful informations but the meaning is nebulous to me, what does it mean and implies?

    >\- Here that phenomena are not perceived as permanent, but known as impermanent through their manifestation

    Related to what u/fe_feron wrote, this can only be understood by *enduring* the pressure of experiences that come up, particularly the ones that result from undertaking the Gradual Training.

    The thing is that as a puthujjana, precisely due to not seeing the signs of one's mind, when one practices recognizing the impermanence of things, one is inevitably doing it on the level of rationalizing or explaining the nature of the experience, meaning that one is essentially *determining* things as impermanent on a very subtle level. That's what MN 2 means with "seeing not-self with self", and it's what will result from contemporary meditation practices generally, as they often involve gratuitously taking a certain "supramundane" *perception* (where you supposedly "observe" consciousness arising and breaking apart in a discontinuous stream) as an insight of anicca. One then *infers* that consciousness or anything else is impermanent *due to* that perception, and that's not an insight about the entire nature of perception, but just another "more special" perception that should equally be seen as impermanent and unownable. Hence the Sutta says that *even* if the puthujjana were to perceive Nibbāna itself, that experience would still be wrong for them, which is why they would not cease to be a puthujjana.

    Practically, seeing that "things are impermanent *because* of their manifestation" is accomplished by seeing the signs of one's mind, and that is also not something that you achieve by catching some *perceptions* or arisen thoughts about this or that. Not even feelings for that matter—the signs of the mind are on the level of what you are *doing* in regard to feelings and perceptions, on any level of subtlety. A good example would be giving in to doubt instead of allowing it to arise on its own for however long it wants, which is a subtle mental action. Once you're not acting out of the pressure on any level, which means you have at least temporarily put aside the conceivings, you get to recognize their true nature that was there from the start (hence abandoning hindrances, which are fueled by [actions](https://suttacentral.net/an10.61/en/sujato?lang=en), leads to understanding naturally). The tendency to act out is the most practically relevant manifestation of that assumption of "separateness".

    &#x200B;

    >(2) Does conceiving here solely means what has been listed (and what could be derived from these points)?

    Not at all. It refers to *any* experience whatsoever that may arise, which is why the Buddha went through so many specific instances, hammering the point that it doesn't matter *what* it is, even the loftiest "supramundane insights" people get out of their meditation. For a puthujjana *all* of it will be wrong because of the inability to not conceive in regard to and delight in *experience as such*.

### SN 8.4: "your mind is burning"

SN 8.4: "your mind is burning with lust due to an inversion of perception (i.e. things are in the wrong order)".

It is said that if the correct order is perceived the right view can be attained.

Bhikkhu Anigha briefly explained this sometime in the past. I want to reflect on this further, taking into account what I encounter on a daily basis. Either driving to and from work, walking on the street, at home doing stuff around the house etc. Is it possible?

Also how this is related to contemplating body in the body, feeling in the feeling etc?

Thank you
🙏

    >It is said that if the correct order is perceived the right view can be attained.

    I wouldn't use the word "perceived", as that tends to carry the notion that it's this special revelation that suddenly transforms you—a perception that frees you from perception by just having it, a contradiction. It's more like, when the right order is known for what it is beyond doubt, one has the Right View. Before that, one can see the right order to some extent but the fetter of doubt makes it not be fully right ultimately.

    >Bhikkhu Anigha briefly explained this sometime in the past. I want to reflect on this further, taking into account what I encounter on a daily basis. Either driving to and from work, walking on the street, at home doing stuff around the house etc. Is it possible?

    Assuming one is already not acting out of intentions of lust, aversion, and distraction by body and speech, the most basic way in which the order is inverted, one needs to recognize that it's not about establishing the right order anew with every individual thing and experience, which in the end would just mean dealing with objects. Rather, individual things and experiences come and go *within* that which is first, and one needs to learn over time to see even the subtlest aspects of one's experience in that manner, as secondary, such as one's most personal moods and internal attitudes. That's the domain that matters, not what's happening to you externally.

    For instance, you recognize how any mental state you might have, no matter how ambiguous and undefined it is, is *second* and the body and senses are *first*, because even such a subtle experience could not possibly arise if there were no sense objects to have moods in regard to. And then whether you walk, stand, sit or lie down, it doesn't matter for as long as you don't forget that "order" and re-establish it when you lose it.

    It's also important to note that it *must not* be any more specific and detailed than this. The moment one starts trying to pin it down into details is when one is already putting specific thoughts first and the context second, perverting the order. So instead of trying to figure out further details, one needs to put in the effort to clarify one's notions of what a "mental state" even is, for example, as even that is not sufficiently recognized by a puthujjana.

    The lack of familiarity with the very phenomena the instruction is pointing towards (and that one already is and always has been experiencing but ignorantly) is the reason why one can't practice correctly, not that the instruction needs to be more detailed.

    >Does this context ever get less murky?

    The whole point is to reach the stage where a "murky" mood or phenomenon can be recognized as real and as valid in itself, and *that* can then be included within the context. The doubt that arises when things are ambiguous is precisely due to the mind's habit to operate on the level of the *content* rather than the *context*. The context of the body being there as the necessary basis for your experience, for example, remains there no matter how "murky" that experience gets, and *that* recognition is what matters, not the characteristics of the experience itself.

    >“So you should truly see any kind of form at all—**past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: all form**—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’

    &#x200B;

    &#x200B;

    >If not, how do I know that I am keeping the context at the right level? Is it because the beast of the mind becomes more still and ends up thrashing the fences we've put around it (sense restraint, precepts) less often over time?

    You won't know it in a way that is free from doubt until you have the Right View; that's what the fetter of doubt is. So it's important to not expect the doubt to not be there since that would just amount to covering it up and practicing "on the wrong level". Instead, one's mind needs to grow so that doubt cannot cause it to lose perspective.  It's precisely that discomfort of ambiguity and lack of clarity that needs to be seen as arisen on its own and thus unownable.

    That is the measure of progress: being able to keep perspective purely and on its own, regardless of what's happening in one's experience in terms of moods, etc. That alone is something one will need to spend tons of effort trying to understand, as the natural expectation of the mind still immersed in ownership is that progress and success are about replacing one mood/experience with another, and *then* comes the context of non-ownership, but that's like locking the stable door after the horse has bolted.

### How does right effort fit in with "endurance of cravings"?

In the past I have heard Thai Forest monks and others say that part of right effort is to recognize an unwholesome thought and to get rid of it, to replace it with something else that is wholesome.  Like a carpenter would drive a rough peg out of a chair with a more refined peg, or something like that.

My understanding of part of Ajahn Nyanamoli's teachings is that - when there is a craving, instead of giving in, or replacing the craving with something else, or distracting myself from the craving with something else, I should allow the craving to be there, to endure it.

Am I understanding that part of AN's teaching correctly?  If so, can you please point out how this isn't a contradiction with right effort, or where I'm missing something.  Thanks very much,

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/18cg91i/how_does_right_effort_fit_in_with_endurance_of/kcc1gtq/)** _2023-12-07 06:01:32:

    >My understanding of part of Ajahn Nyanamoli's teachings is that - when there is a craving, instead of giving in, or replacing the craving with something else, or distracting myself from the craving with something else, I should allow the craving to be there, to endure it.

    You could phrase it that way depending on the context, but it's also important to recognize that you're not literally being told to allow unwholesome states to continue unchecked, as that would be taking it too far. Rather, the point is that whatever is taking place when you endure the *pressure* of a mental state correctly (which is what a puthujjana needs to learn to stop being a puthujjana) cannot be called craving anymore, regardless of that fact that it won't "feel right" to you initially. Because of that, it's better to say that you're supposed to endure the mental pressure, not "craving".

    Craving is basically the deeply-rooted tendency of wanting to *respond* to pressure, whether positively or negatively. The (practicing) puthujjana's misconception is precisely in confusing pressure with unwholesomeness and trying to get rid of it, or also confusing acting out of pressure with wholesomeness in some cases. The attempt to endure the pressure instead will not be perfect initially, but it will not entail as course of a mistake as these two extremes.

    &#x200B;

    >Like a carpenter would drive a rough peg out of a chair with a more refined peg, or something like that.

    People don't even contemplate the simile carefully, and it actually reinforces our point. This is the first simile in MN 20. When you have a certain, say, sensual thought that is pressuring you, replacing it with something else is exactly like using a peg that is just as course, meaning you end up with just a different form of the same problem (you removed the sensuality which is welcoming the pressure, but are now left with aversion towards the pressure, and the "amount" of craving did not even diminish, it just "morphed"). The "finer peg" would be establishing a peripheral context that does not deny what has arisen, but also prevents you from welcoming what has arisen, and that can only be achieved through that *endurance* of the pressure. That context could even be the second reflection that is explained in that very sutta (and in MN 19 as well).

    Each subsequent "strategy" in MN 20 is actually happening within the first, so even in the last one, where you're supposed to clench your teeth and "crush mind with mind", you won't be doing that rightly and it won't result in abandoning of unwholesome as it says it should if that "crushing mind with mind" is being done as a form of *replacing* what is arisen with something just as coarse. That's why it says it's like a stronger man would beat down a weaker man \*from above (\*from his head or shoulders). The stronger man doesn't get into a *fistfight* face-to-face with the weaker man, which is what people usually do. Not only with this strategy but with all of them, including the first.

### An interesting translation of Yoniso Manasikara that I think would be appreciated here.

We are all familiar with the more common translations of yoniso manasikara being rational/wise/careful etc. attention but I came across one that is close to what we're all familiar with here.

Michael Olds translates SN.I.iv:4 as "It is through mentally tracing things back to their origins, by making the effort to track paths to their sources, beggars, that I have reached incomparable freedom, seen incomparable freedom with my own eyes."

Which is a much more practicable translation than everyone I've seen except HH's.

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/18cebpu/an_interesting_translation_of_yoniso_manasikara/kcbz4mb/)** _2023-12-07 05:36:31:

    It's a bit less watered down than "rational, wise, careful", but technically it's still inaccurate even just based on the Pali. Yoniso means "according to; by means of", which is very different from the directionality involved pretty much all modern translations (and ways of practice as well). You don't try to "look at" the origin/source, and "tracking things back to their origins" carries that implication, but rather you attend to things *according to* the source, which is already there if you know how to recognize it. You could also say "according to the cause", but "cause" must be understood in a strictly present and simultaneous sense, meaning that which is the necessary basis for what you're attending to while you're attending to it. That's how one discerns *paṭiccasamuppāda:* as [SN 12.67](https://suttacentral.net/sn12.67/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin) puts it, it's akin to two bundles of reeds holding each other up. There is no temporal "sequence" involved, which would wrongly be implied in the "tracking things back" translation.

    Hence Ajahn Nyanamoli translated it as "concurrent attention" in his book on jhāna. This [essay](https://www.hillsidehermitage.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/The-Meaning-of-Yoniso-Manasikara-Bhikkhu-Anigha.pdf) goes into the principle of yoniso manasikāra in-depth.

### Why is it that greed, aversion, delusion will go away with the right context?

In various talks, it has been expressed that if one were contemplating the nature of things in the right order/context, then greed, aversion, delusion will naturally subside, given that one is already practicing sense restraint, keeping the 8 precepts, etc. (apologies for any poor paraphrasing).  Why/how is this the case?  Is it because with the right context in mind, the "I-making" / "self-making" is (gradually) reduced, resulting in decreasing appropriation of sensual pleasures and concomitant increase in dispassion?

And is it fair to say that as long as there is greed, aversion, and delusion, then one is definitely not practicing with the right context?  Or does greed, aversion, and delusion take time to diminish even if one is practicing right context correctly?

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/18ao7tb/why_is_it_that_greed_aversion_delusion_will_go/kc33po5/)** _2023-12-05 12:20:32:

    It's because greed, aversion, and delusion (rāga-dosa-moha) all have their roots in ignorance (avijjā), so when there is knowledge instead of ignorance, they cannot remain. Those 3 things are basically just *symptoms* of ignorance, which is the core illness.

    In the case you mention of sensual pleasures, it's the ignorance of their true nature, as impermanent and unsatisfactory, that makes one have lust for them in the first place. So that's why one should not be trying to get rid of lust directly, but only re-establish the right context regarding whatever one is lustful about, and so, again, treat the illness of ignorance instead of its symptoms.

    >And is it fair to say that as long as there is greed, aversion, and delusion, then one is definitely not practicing with the right context? Or does greed, aversion, and delusion take time to diminish even if one is practicing right context correctly?

    If the context is *truly* there (which can only be the case for a person with the Right View and thus Right Recolletion), the 3 poisons cannot be there at that moment. What takes time to diminish is the *liability* to greed, aversion, and delusion, meaning that while a sotāpanna or higher trainee can get rid of them in a finger-snap through the right context, they will still come back eventually. That's what is referred to as "underlying tendencies".

### Yoniso Manasikāra and not wanting to endure whatever perception

Hello, as I was finishing reading "[The Meaning of Yoniso Manasikara](https://www.hillsidehermitage.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/The-Meaning-of-Yoniso-Manasikara-Bhikkhu-Anigha.pdf)" by Bhante Anigha I came accross the 6th point conveying the following idea:

&#x200B;

>So, one has to remind oneself and re-establish recollection only when the context has clearly been lost, not all the time neurotically. Then you also get to see that "losing the context" is a choice, because you are within that container, you are within the body even if you don’t think about it, so only ignorant choices by which the primacy of the "womb" is clearly disregarded and ownership is implied, can actually make you believe that you are the first, the master, and the womb is second. For example, it is impossible to seek pleasing experiences for the sake of sensual gratification or act out of indignation towards disagreeable experiences without tacitly assuming that you are the owner of the six senses and body. This is how you would automatically ignore, through your superficially unrelated actions, that this notion of "I" and "mine" is actually within that body and thus cannot truly possess it—and this is how yoniso manasikāra would be forsaken and ayoniso become established.  
>  
>The foremost obstacle to yoniso manasikāra is nothing other than one's own lack of restraint and unwholesome choices  
>  
>\[...\]  
>  
>Thus, if you simply recollect the context and know that the yoni is there, and doesn't become overly engaged with whatever comes within that "womb", including thoughts, you have not lost the recollection, even without actively thinking about it. Even if your mind is trying to hinder you and cause you doubt to revisit and rehash all your Dhamma knowledge, that's still not an excuse to put the doubt first and the yoni second. **If the context is there, the discomfort of whatever perceptions and mental states come within that needs to be endured—not wanting to endure it would put you "outside of the womb". You would willingly delight in "birth" again, and further sustain ignorance.**

&#x200B;

(1) Is the fact that not wanting to endure and acting out of discomfort from whatever perception or mental state puts me "outside of the womb" because that would mean I'm identifying with the feeling or perception, or identifying as the one feeling or perceiving?

&#x200B;

(2) I'm imagining how I could apply that to something trivial as having the knee hurting more and more when staying crosslegged for too long.

Can I  —or rather, does that mean I should— endure that pain and not move to release the discomfort just by dismissing it as not being "my" pain but another feeling that doesn't belong to me in any way and that is not important, ~~even though its existence is "felt more than real", I can't deny it,~~ *(my bad it has nothing to do with denying its existence)* and my attention struggles to focus on anything else even though I keep this body being the womb of that experience as the context?

Would moving to release the pain be a choice to lose the context and be ayoniso manasikāra?

    >(1) Is the fact that not wanting to endure and acting out of discomfort from whatever perception or mental state puts me "outside of the womb" because that would mean I'm identifying with the feeling or perception, or identifying as the one feeling or perceiving?

    The latter, although ultimately the whole reason why the assumption of self is gratuitous is because that sense of an "entity" that is feeling or perceiving is *also* just a feeling and perception of a subtler kind, which gets confused with it being more fundamental than the other feelings and perceptions, which is isn't. The sense of self is real, it's basically "the point of view that makes the choices" to put it colloquially, but the point is that *that* is also within the five aggregates, and it's still impermanent, suffering and unownable, just like everything else.

    >(2) I'm imagining how I could apply that to something trivial as having the knee hurting more and more when staying crosslegged for too long.

    You should certainly not be overly concerned with avoiding bodily discomfort, but that's not really the level where yoniso manasikāra applies. It's on the level of mental states, such as the one that's pushing you to not move when your knee hurts, thinking that that's somehow contributing to purification of mind. You would get more out of questioning that entire attitude than just going through with that coarse, and ultimately arbitrary determination (because why not go further and stop breathing? why stop at enduring the pain in your knees?)

    \>thinking it was conveying the idea that not keeping enduring whatever perception was already ayoniso manasikara. Probably failing to see something more subtle as you can 'want' to endure it (in the sense not assuming you shouldn't feel/perceive that, not assuming you shouldn't be liable to feel/perceive that) and still put an end to this enduring?

    Yes, because enduring "everything" refers to enduring the root level where the craving actually is, meaning the attitude of your mind towards the experience *as a whole*. Not towards *every* specific thing within that experience. You can practice equanimity all you want of that specific level, and go to great lengths in putting up with discomfort as the Jains did, but you still won't be enduring what needs to be endured: pressure in the most general sense, including towards these subtle actions.

    > So that would be pretty much everything (this body, and the body within the body, and the world) except the choice one can make right here right now within the possibilities one has?

    No, it would not be everything, since in the Suttas it is shown that even Arahant's have preferences and do things to modify their experience (as does anyone who chooses to continue breathing), even things like seeking treatment when ill which are technically rooted in trying to make things not be what they are.

    What craving really is can only be revealed by practicing the Gradual Training. It cannot be grasped in theory, because one will be either "overdoing" or "underdoing" one's idea of what it is unless one has *actually* gone through that process of sense restraint and purification of actions and livelihood.

### Contact is just “contact” for the Arahant?

I listened to H.H.’s talk on Suttas entitled, “Overcome the Pressure”. It’s an older talk. The Bhūmija Sutta, SN 12.25 is featured for discussion. 

In the talk, patticasamuppada is discussed and Ajahn Nyanamoli seems to use the word “pressure” as a replacement for ”contact”.

Question: I think he saying that for the pathujjana, contact with the senses IS automatically “pressure” (pressure to act out of feeling), whereas for the Arahant, contact with the senses is simply contact with the senses.
…Hence, for the Arahant, “the seen is just the seen, the heard is just the heard”, etc.

Did I understand this correctly?
Thank you

Edit: corrected the title of the talk

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/18aix9a/contact_is_just_contact_for_the_arahant/kbyamih/)** _2023-12-04 13:48:01:

    You could say that "contact is just contact" for the mind (citta) of the Arahant, but as far as the senses go, pressure remains pressure like before. As SN 35.228 explains, the Arahant, the one who has "gone beyond", has done so because they *withstand* the current of the 6 oceans, not because there is no current anymore. The latter is what people tend to implicitly misunderstand with the phrase "X is just X for an Arahant", which in theory is not wrong in itself, but  being a puthujjana *means* not being able to even fathom what an Arahant is, so one must not forget that whatever explanation of an Arahant one hears will not be truly seen until one has the Right View.

    Without the Right View, one cannot see the Middle Way, so if one hears that "there is no pressure for an Arahant", one will "overshoot" one's abandonment of the pressure to the point of interfering with phenomena that are not unwholesome, whereas if one hears "there is still pressure for an Arahant", the opposite will happen, and one will not be recognizing impurities as impurities.

    So in the end, what matters most is to not take one's present understanding for granted, not to have the right idea right off the bat, which is impossible without seeing the Dhamma for oneself.

### breath is default object!!

I understand and am not doing breath observation as a goal. 

However I found that when there is no thought. naturally breath comes in foreground. and becomes object of attention. and it is peaceful too. I am also open to any thoughts. and I am watchful of my intention etc. however many time I find myself resting in breath observation.

is that ok. or some kind of delusion.?

    As you put it, this is "breath observation", which is an entirely different thing from Anapanasati. It's "OK" for as long as you don't think that that's getting you any closer to understanding the Dhamma, but that's not usually the view people have. They think they're practicing Anapanasati/satipaṭṭhānas by doing that, and *that* is the delusion.

    Anapanasati is about discerning the body, feelings, mind and thoughts while you are breathing, not about observing your breath or bodily sensations (although of course those things come up on their own; the point is to not think they're somehow important). The former is yoniso manasikāra; the latter is the opposite. The former is the [abiding of the Tathāgata](https://suttacentral.net/sn54.11/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=linebyline&reference=none&notes=sidenotes&highlight=false&script=latin); the latter can perfectly well be taught by a mere psychotherapist.

    &#x200B;

    Edit: Also, the breath is not a "default object", as the title says. The *breathing body* is a background to whatever object arises, and the sensations of breathing involved in "breath observation" are just one among that infinite range of secondary objects, and there is nothing special about them.

### Wouldn't you need a healthy sense of self to navigate an abuse situation?

... is the question my therapist asked when I started sharing my interest in buddhism and explaining the concepts.

She is starting to get very interested in it too and is asking me questions like this to guage my understanding.

I still cannot answer this question. The western psychological literature does show that people with low self-esteem, failure to maintain boundaries, fear of abandonment etc. struggle immensely to escape from abusive situations. Psychotherapy aims to improve one's sense of self-worth and self-esteem, understanding of what healthy boundaries are to ultimately equip the person with the understanding and knowledge necessary to escape abuse.

My poor attempt at answering this question:

Fear of abandonment is rooted in craving - craving against the unpleasant feeling of abandonment, an idea which implies a sense of 'self'. If there was no sense of self felt, there would be nobody who would feel abandoned.

Failure to maintain boundaries is rooted in both ignorance and craving - ignorance of the fact that the choices you make to allow people to overstep your boundaries are pressured by craving for various things e.g. external validation. Failure to maintain boundaries is once again a subtle attempt at getting rid of the unpleasant feeling caused by the pressures of various unwholesome state (e.g. aversion towards abandonment, aversion towards angering the abuser)  which only leads to further suffering.

poor self-esteem is pretty much having very negative opinions about yourself and why you might 'deserve' to be in an abusive situation. If you feel that you deserve to be abused, you become averse to the idea of being free from abuse.

Besides the management vs uprooting of dukkha, it seems to me that there are many similarities between monastic practice and psychotherapy when it comes to the \*actions\* you must take to free yourself from suffering, which all boil down to understanding the nature of your actions, recognising that ultimately you have to endure the discomfort and start practising the right actions no matter what thoughts and feelings might sway you otherwise.

So I'm thinking that a negative, unhealthy sense of self isn't the root cause of one's struggle to get out of an abusive situation. The negative view is just a symptom of the underlying illness - the self! If one extinguished their feeling of self, there would be no breeding ground for feeling abandoned, or having negative opinions about one's 'self'. The person would become aware of their responsibility to cultivate awareness, essentially practise a form of sense restraint and ensure they make the right actions despite the enduring unpleasant feelings that they feel.

But then the question becomes, if one had completely lost their sense of self, why would they crave to get OUT of an abusive situation if they are not resistant to the unpleasant feeling of being abused? This highlights my confusion with the motivations of an arahant when it comes to preserving their own life.

Another question is, why is having a healthy sense of self problematic compared to the ultimate goal of losing your sense of self altogether? Is this a management vs uprooting issue too? Are there traps that come with having a healthy sense of self where further dukkha is revealed?

Lastly, I imagine someone who gets into buddhism with a healthy skepticism might accept non-identification with the six sense base, but they might then say "aha! the self is that within you that makes these choices to either go with or against the grain of these pulling senses. Your autonomy is what the self is, and you need a healthy sense of self to realise that you have to go against the grain of your feelings to get of the abuse!"

This is where my already limited understanding falls apart. I would appreciate help on this as I know it would highlight major gaps in my knowledge I can start improving on!

&#x200B;

P.S. I myself escaped domestic abuse, so if there are any questions you have about my actual experience that you think could be used as examples to illustrate the buddhist view, please absolutely ask away.

    As others have pointed out, the main issue with this is the underlying misconception of what *anattā* is.

    Self-esteem and the extent of one's boundaries are not on the same level as Arahantship and an Arahant does not stop manifesting those things externally. One Arahant might tend to have firmer boundaries and appear sterner externally, while another may appear to some like a pushover. And that's just based on the habits that they had developed before even taking up the practice (although the forms of enforcing boundaries or of failing to do so that were rooted in anger or fear respectively would disappear).

    &#x200B;

    >But then the question becomes, if one had completely lost their sense of self, why would they crave to get OUT of an abusive situation if they are not resistant to the unpleasant feeling of being abused? This highlights my confusion with the motivations of an arahant when it comes to preserving their own life.

    One does not "lose" one's sense of self. That's not what the Suttas say. The Suttas say that one recognizes that the five aggregates are not worth taking as mine because they are impermanent and suffering. That may sound the same due to the contemporary wrong views that have muddled the Dhamma, but they're very different. "Losing" one's sense of self is the extreme of denial while recognizing that things are "unownable", as we like to say, is the Middle Way.

    The idea that you "lose" your sense of self is actually still rooted in the unenlightened mind's misunderstanding of the self being possible to pin down to some specific thing, which is the only way you could "lose" it like you lose your car keys or something. But the suttas say that what one loses is upādāna (translated by us as "assumption"), in this case, the assumption of a view of self. So what one does is abandon a gratuitous *view/assumption* that was not even supposed to be there and was incompatible with the five aggregates all along. The idea of "losing" the sense of self already implies one misconceives it to be somehow "in" the five aggregates since that's the domain where gain and loss apply.

    &#x200B;

    >Here, householder, the uninstructed worldling, who is not a seer of the noble ones and is unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma, who is not a seer of superior persons and is unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma, regards form as self, or self as possessing form, or form as in self, or self as in form.

    SN 22.1

    Thus, that which there used to be a view of self in regard to retains the capacity to intend to get out of abusive situations or anything of that sort when there is no good reason to put up with it.

    Because of this, the idea of having a "healthy sense of self" does not even apply and is unjustifiable. The view of self establishes itself in regard to the five aggregates, and for a puthujjana who takes the five aggregates as theirs, what they're really saying when they think of "healthy sense of self" is a healthy *view* of self, and that is nothing but an oxymoron. The view of self makes one's entire existence unhealthy/unwholesome, while the absence of that view makes the experience of a noble individual automatically healthy, regardless of what takes place within it and how much they may choose to avoid certain situations that cause unnecessary suffering, or to put up with them if there is a purpose.

    >Lastly, I imagine someone who gets into buddhism with a healthy skepticism might accept non-identification with the six sense base, but they might then say "aha! the self is that within you that makes these choices to either go with or against the grain of these pulling senses. Your autonomy is what the self is, and you need a healthy sense of self to realise that you have to go against the grain of your feelings to get of the abuse!"

    No, making choices is not what the view of self is about. The view of self is established in regard to the making of choices, which is an affair of the aggregates and does not need to involve craving. A puthujjana does not see this, and they either overly intend the choices and take them as theirs or try to not make choices so as to not have the view of self. They can't see the Middle Way whereby choices are left where they always were and to the same extent without being appropriated in any way.

    >So from what I'm understanding, the 'feeling' of there being an emergent phenomenon of self is always there - you just stop taking it to be 'yours' since it is a fluid process that changes over time without your saying. 

    *anattā* is not rooted in the fact that experience is constantly changing--that is not actually a fundamental truth of experience, since you could always find something if you look on a general enough level, that *has not* changed even since the day you were born. If anattā were about there being "no lasting entity", then the existence of such lasting phenomena, many of which are very close and personal, would suggest that the self-view may have a sound basis. This view of anattā is actually one of the huge issues with contemporary Buddhism, due to people trying to make sense of the Dhamma through modern science, and ending up doing the opposite.

    >In the same sense, you can't choose your thoughts, they arise and cease independently, so they cannot be yours as you have not willed them to be - all you can do is react to them.

    You *can* choose your thoughts in a way, and you can do more than just react to them in the sense that you are not "locked in" to one single phenomenon every single moment, as a deterministic, scientific view would take it. You are free to think about whatever you want whenever you want, but what you cannot do is alter the range of options that are offered to you directly. To illustrate, you can choose to move to another location where you expect certain thoughts to manifest, but even then that is not a guarantee, say if despite re-visiting a place where something important happened, you still fail to recall the event, or in insufficient detail. You were perfectly free to move to that location, as well as to try as hard as you can to refresh your memory, to not do either, or to do only one of them. Thus, ultimately the level where anattā applies cannot be recognized by reasoning alone, because reasoning is essentially within the same domain as the sense of control we all have that is genuine. The non-control part is on a more fundamental level than that, which is why science will never be able to "explain" anattā. 

    >Is feeling of self the same thing as what it means to be an individual, to refer to yourself as 'you', 'me'? Recognising that we require these conventional labels to communicate and navigate the world, but not to take them for granted? Not to take them "personally"?

    That is the feeling of self-identity (meaning, something that can be said to be the same in two different occasions) and that is categorically not what anattā is about. The fact that the idea of "me" and "mine" should not be held on to is not because there is ultimately no self-identity and they are "just conventions", but because to truly call something "mine", you would need to have full ability to control its fate, and with the five aggregates/six senses, [that is not the case](https://suttacentral.net/sn22.59/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=sidebyside&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin).

    >“And what, bhikkhus, is the burden? It should be said: that the five aggregates subject to clinging. What five? The form aggregate subject to clinging, the feeling aggregate subject to clinging, the perception aggregate subject to clinging, the volitional formations aggregate subject to clinging, the consciousness aggregate subject to clinging. This is called the burden.

    >“And what, bhikkhus, is the carrier of the burden? It should be said: __the individual (puggala), this venerable one of such a name and clan.__ This is called the carrier of the burden.

    SN 22.22

    >Could you clarify how perceiving the sense of self to be 'in' the five aggregates to be a misconception? From my unknowledgeable mind sense of self is a feeling that occurs within my consciousness, which is everything inside these five aggregates. Or do you mean the sense of being an individual is composed by the emergence of the five aggregates, so IS the five aggregates, rather than being "inside" them?

    The very fact of asking this question already entails not recognizing what the sense of self is. As [MN 2](https://suttacentral.net/mn2/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=sidebyside&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin) puts it, a puthujjana's theorizing about whether and to what extent their self exists will only lead to wrong views, so that sort of reasoning is not the direction that should be pursued. No matter what conclusions are reached, the view of self will still be somewhere in the picture.

    Firstly, the idea that things occur "within" your consciousness is a modern idea incompatible with the Buddha's teaching, and it's fundamentally inaccurate. What you are calling "your cosciousness" on that occasion is just a group of form, feeling, perceptions, intentions and (actual) consciousness or viññāṇa in Pali. 

    By definition your view of self cannot be something that occurs "within" your five aggregates, for if it were, the view of self would be justified, and you would have to exert ultimate control over your five aggregates permanently to destroy it (and most people don't realize this is what their practice is wrongly aiming at). So yes, it would be more accurate to say that the sense of being an individual is due to the emergence of the five aggregates as a whole, and that sense, as the sutta I quoted above shows, is not what the problem is. That's why it's inaccurate to talk about "sense of self" as that which needs to be abandoned, as the implicit idea there is that that sense of individuality must go (which is a defining characteristic of the experience of five aggregates and is also within them), whereas the real issue is the *assumption of ownership* of the five aggregates. "View of self" is the expression we should be using (sakkāyadiṭṭhi).

    >“But sir, is that assumption (upādāna) the same thing as the five assumed aggregates? Or is assumption one thing and the five assumed aggregates another?”

    >“Neither. Rather, the desire and greed for them is the assumption there.”

    MN 109

    You will never be able to find that assumption of ownership "in" form, "in" things you feel, perceive or intend, nor "in" your consciousness, yet there could be no such assumption if form, feeling, perception, intentions and consciousness had never manifested.

    >I actually was like "wait a minute" and started googling basic word definitions to find out whether I \*truly\* understand what "mine" entails. First I googled the definition of "mine" which means something that belongs to a person. then I had to google what "belong" actually means, which the definition states as being "an affinity for a place or activity". Basic general definition of affinity is an attraction towards something.

    That "affinity" results from the notion that the thing can ultimately be controlled. "Ultimately" means that, despite things changing to some extent on their own accord, which even the most unenlightened person can recognize, it is still (ignorantly thought to be) possible to ensure that one will obtain pleasure and avoid pain or neutrality arising from an experience at one's behest. Eating your favorite food is pleasant in its very nature due to the agreeable tastes, but that does not mean that your *mind* will actually feel pleasure. You might feel just as depressed while eating the food and after as you did before, or you may not. That's the "level" where the "non-control", "not-mine ness", and *anattā* really are. Nothing to do with the duration or continuation of the experience, as hypothetically you *could* do nothing but eat your favorite food for the rest of your life.

    &#x200B;

    >But I suppose even looking at these definitions is misleading because if "mine" logically means something that is naturally attracted to me, or naturally stays with me, I could mistake it for mine. Is this why it's called impermanence rather than non-ownership? The fact that even things that stay with you are SUBJECT to change, and \*you could not do anything about it, even if you wanted to\*.

    So you just have to recognize it in the way above, and it becomes clear why "mine" is still accurate. The experience of the pleasant taste can stay with you indefinitely by some wild stretch of the imagination, but the actual pleasure on the mental level, whereby you would say "I am happy"--that is impermanent and thus impossible to exercise ownership over. (And technically, even the access to the agreeable food, as well as the continued function of your taste buds, are also impermanent).

    >*What you are calling "your cosciousness" on that occasion is just a group of form, feeling, perceptions, intentions and (actual) consciousness or viññāṇa in Pali.*  
    >  
    >I suppose out of habit I call it "my" consciousness, or "my" experience when really it is just consciousness or experience. And the idea of something being "inside" consciousness implies there is an outside, which I cannot possibly conceive of.

    What I was alluding to there is that consciousness in the Buddha's teaching is not "the sum of everything that you experience", as people nowadays often take it to be. That mixes up the aggregates of feeling, perceptions, and intentions with consciousness, which would prevent any understanding of the impermanence of those aggregates. *viññāṇa* does not "have things within it", it is *the presence of things* most generally. Furthermore, there is not "one consciousness" as people usually believe, which would tend to imply the sense of self. The Buddha defined one consciousness for every single sense organ, meaning none of them can be the "central" one.

    >How would I go about answering the question of whether one would need a healthy sense of self to navigate abuse, or why the question is invalid? I don't know whether the issue is not knowing what the concept of "healthy boundaries" would mean in the context of the five aggregates, and as you've said, even theorising about what the sense of self is already leads to wrong views.

    By recognizing that whatever you call a "sense of self" is not a problem if to you that means the ability to deal with such situations, and that it's the \*view\* of self, rooted in the ignorance of impermanence, suffering and non-ownership, that is the real problem. The lack of a view of self would allow one to deal with any conceivable external situation if there is a good reason for it, but the difference would be that if one does not get what one wants in the end, one would not suffer.

### Question on discerning the right order and Anapanasati Sutta

When breathing in/out sensitive to the entire body, does it matter if one experiences the breath or the whole body as that which peripheral/in the background? In my attempts at practicing in accordance with this sutta, I, at times, experience the knowledge that the in/out breath is occurring in the background while the feelings associated with the entire body along with the perception of the body occupy the foreground. At other times, however, I experience the knowledge that the body is sitting in the background while the feelings associated with breath along with the perception of the breath occupy the foreground. Despite the seeming reversal in what occupies the background and foreground foreground, it seems to me that in both cases rupa is discerned as the more fundamental aggregate upon which vedana and sanna depend. Am I discerning things correctly by looking at it accordingly?

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/189gorp/question_on_discerning_the_right_order_and/kbulddh/)** _2023-12-03 19:07:35:

    To add to what u/no_thingness wrote, what the Ānāpānasatisutta is referring to with "experiencing the whole body" is absolutely not what people usually expect,  which leads to the contemporary practices that conflate attending to what is essentially just *more* bodily sensations with what the Buddha is here instructing (and which also turns [the meditation of the Tathāgata](https://suttacentral.net/sn54.11/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin) into something quite trivial that anyone and their grandma can do with just a bit of instruction and practice).

    "Whole body"  refers to the "place" where the aggregate of form is recognized in its totality, and, although that *does* involve every part of your body in a secondary sense, it is impossible that you will ever be able to reach that recognition of the whole body *through* specific body parts and sensations.

    MN 28 clearly states that the sixth sense base, whose experiences are often not even acknowledged as being equally real as the objects of the 5 senses by many "meditators", also gives rise to form/rūpa. *And that is also part of the "whole body" that one is supposed to discern*. Not only that, but one sees the breathing as the background of *even that,* meaning that one's recognition of the breath is even subtler than those already subtle mental phenomena. "Subtle" here means structurally more fundamental and thus *overlooked* in favor of the more "palpable" objects, despite that foundation being there the whole time; it's not that you are perceiving some sort of "new reality" that wasn't there before, which would just be another perception within the same not-fundamental-enough level of experience (and people usually mistake things happening on that level for insight or liberation).

    Good that you pointed that out, I should actually explain it differently to avoid confusion.

    What I meant with the breath being the background is essentially the "breathing body", not the foreground perceptions of breathing--which is what people's sati usually (mistakenly) centers around nowadays. You could say that that breathing body is a background to anything that, referring back to my reply above, might pertain to the 6 sense base (and the specific perceptions of breathing are of course within that, but they're not what's relevant). You then get to see that "behind" that 6 sense base which itself constitutes "a body", all there is is another, more fundamental body than that one--the latter being being the necessary, inseparable basis for the existence of the former. That necessary basis is the body as this thing that breathes, without which the more particular things that happen within the six sense base would never be possible.

    Refer to my essay on the \[4 satipaṭṭhānas\]([https://www.hillsidehermitage.org/seeing-a-body-within-the-body/](https://www.hillsidehermitage.org/seeing-a-body-within-the-body/)) which explains this very principle.

    And again, you could more easily walk on water than you could discern that peripheral breathing-body correctly through attending to \*perceptions\* of breathing and associated bodily sensations. The 5 aggregates fundamentally cannot cross into each other's domains, and by trying to do that, you are essentially trying to use perceptions to discern form--a futile endeavor.

    So yes, you could take the foreground act of breathing as that which you pay direct attention towards, but you have to recognize that thoughts and memories of all sorts will be coming up while you're doing that, and all those movements of *mano* also need to be included within the body that depends upon the breathing body, not *replaced* with perceptions of breathing or bodily sensations until that's all that remains, which would mean you're not even understanding the full extent of the body (6 senses) anymore, but a tiny, irrelevant part of it.

    The principle of mindfulness itself or yoniso manasikāṛa should be fully independent of any particulars, but the establishment of mindfulness at any given time is dependent on the enduring memory of a specific phenomenon that is more general than all others, *while* those others continue to manifest. 

    Counter-intuitively, not having a clear direction of what to recollect means still being caught in the particulars of experience, as the phenomena the Buddha spoke about as anchors for mindfulness are precisely those that *can* be discerned (not that the person will necessarily succeed though) regardless of what is taking place within the 6 sense base (specificity). The activity of breathing is one of them.

### The Jhāna Method (Sutta)

>“Before my enlightenment, while I was just a bodhisatta, not yet fully enlightened, it occurred to me too: ‘Good is renunciation, good is solitude.’ Yet my mind did not launch out upon renunciation and become placid, settled, and liberated in it, though I saw it as peaceful. It occurred to me: ‘Why is it that my mind does not launch out upon renunciation and become placid, settled, and liberated in it, though I see it as peaceful?’ Then it occurred to me: ***‘I have not seen the danger in sensual pleasures and have not cultivated that; I have not achieved the benefit in renunciation and have not  pursued it. Therefore my mind does not launch out upon renunciation and become placid, settled, and liberated in it, though I see it as peaceful.’

>“Then, Ānanda, it occurred to me: ‘If, having seen the danger in sensual pleasures, I would cultivate that, and if, having achieved the benefit in renunciation, I would pursue it, it is then possible that my mind would launch out upon renunciation and become placid, settled, and liberated in it, since I see it as peaceful.’ Sometime later, ***having seen the danger in sensual pleasures, I cultivated that, and having achieved the benefit in renunciation, I pursued it. My mind then launched out upon renunciation and became placid, settled, and liberated in it, since I saw it as peaceful.***

>“Sometime later, Ānanda, secluded from sensual pleasures … I entered and dwelled in the first jhāna. While I was dwelling in this state, perception and attention accompanied by sensuality occurred in me and I felt it as an affliction.

    Not only that, but you're not just cultivating specific thoughts. It's not that phenomena as course as this or that thought actually persist in your experience when the mind has been sufficiently "steeped" in the right context. Specific thoughts are impermanent and would not constitute an imperturbable establishment, which is what samādhi is.  The establishment of samādhi is about the *mind* having been trained beforehand to have a certain attitude by default no matter what arises, even if you forget the particular themes you used to develop that samādhi completely (and that's the point; active effort cannot co-exist simultaneously with that pleasure of total non-engagement with engaging things, although it will certainly never come about without a great deal of active effort, both on the macro level of one's entire life and on the more acute level of the reflections in MN 19).

    A theme of contemplation "bears a significant relationship to the whole of experience" only if *you* are making the effort to apply that reflection to the whole of experience. That won't happen magically, and it's the result of grasping the sign of the mind, which is the result of the Gradual Training. You can be thinking about profound Dhamma all you want, but if it's not rooted in that "right level", it's [not doing anything to the present craving](https://suttacentral.net/sn47.8/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=sidebyside&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin), and might even be making it worse if you're acting out of restlessness and doubt through it.

    And yes, those reflections must certainly not be limited to a meditation session only. What matters most is that you are actually *living* those reflections to the utmost degree (as in, increasingly recognizing the signs of the mind and applying them to that more accurate "level") and that your actions by body and speech are guided by them (meaning you use your intentions behind actions as the criteria, not that there is a particular behavior apart from the precepts that is always in line with wholesome reflections  in itself). What you do in a "meditation session" is actually bringing the same recollection "to the fore" that you have been already developing beforehand.  That's why in the Gradual Training, sitting down in a secluded place comes after all the previous prerequisites are in place. 

    One can certainly do it before that, and use it to dedicate more effort to clarify one's understanding in a more undistracted manner, and to question oneself as to how and why those prerequisites still have not been met. Still, one should not expect it to lead to the first jhāna unless non-sensuality has been thoroughly cultivated "off the cushion" well beforehand.

    >“When one abides uninflamed by lust, unfettered, uninfatuated, contemplating danger, then the five aggregates affected by clinging are diminished for oneself in the future; and one’s craving—which brings renewal of being, is accompanied by delight and lust, and delights in this or that—is abandoned. One’s bodily and mental troubles are abandoned, one’s bodily and mental torments are abandoned, one’s bodily and mental fevers are abandoned, and one experiences bodily and mental pleasure.  
    “The view of a person such as this is right view. His intention is right intention, his effort is right effort, his recollection is right recollection, his composure is right composure. But his bodily action, his verbal action, and his livelihood have already been well purified earlier.

    What must be understood there is the level where *sensuality* and not *pleasure* happens in the first place. That's already what the recognition of the sign of the mind reveals, and is much subtler than any of the preliminary intellectual distinctions one might make.

    The mind has sensuality when, in the face of the arising of the pleasure that naturally accompanies certain sense objects (which are experienced through none other than vitakkavicāra, even if you're just perceiving and not coarsely pondering on anything at the time), there is a sense of having to *do* something about that pleasure, be it welcome it or somehow deny it and push it away (including through very subtle mental choices to, say, contemplate Dhamma but rooted in wanting get rid of the pressure). Establishing that "even" attitude of the Middle Way is not a matter of choice, especially since the distinguishing characteristic of a puthujjana is their ignorance of their own intentions (sign of the mind) and thus inability to intend what they know is good for them at least in theory (imperturbability or non-lust in this case).

    That means that when they *try* to neither welcome nor deny the pleasure of a sense object so as to abandon both sensuality and aversion, since they heard that that's what they should do, their citta at the back is actually still welcoming or denying something on a less obvious level. Not realizing that, they just continue doing what they're doing, thinking that they're practicing correctly.

    Ultimately, that peripheral attitude of the mind is another phenomenon, which is why all it takes to disengage from it is to recognize it (this is what the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta means with the hindrances being present or absent "internally"; MN 119 also mentions the mind becoming stilled "internally").

    Only by fully recognizing that peripheral attitude of the citta, which will never be visible even as a specific *thought* (which is not say that it's somehow hidden or mystical; it's right there but the default habit is look "past it" and see only the "palpable", external sense objects instead including thoughts), does one get to see what the full extent of "perception and attention accompanied by sensuality" means, and in regard to *that*, one then starts practicing "feeling that as an affliction", as the sutta above and MN 19 say. Anything less than that will entail misconceiving *arisen things* as unwholesome, not your citta's attitude in regard to them. This is how you end up with the idea that the first jhāna is about becoming *unaware* of the 5 senses.

    I see what you mean now. 

    >so "accompanied by sensuality" seems to imply that desire and lust are occurring in jhana, where sensuality had been abandoned (at least as I understand the teachings of AN and his disciples)
      
    >so in this sentence, am I misunderstanding "accompanied by," "occurred," or do I misunderstand "secluded from unwholesome" in jhana definitions to be more strictly denoting total abandonment than is actually meant, or is it something else?

    Yes, what I wrote is not that unrelated to this anyway. Fundamentally, the reason why a person who has *factually* entered jhāna, which the sutta here is not denying, and yet *still* be falling back to "perceptions and attentions accompanied by sensuality", is because, as you put it, sensuality is "desire and lust in regard to things in the world". That's what I was referring to above with the "peripheral attitude of the citta". Since it's such a subtle thing (which, just to emphasize, does not at all mean that it's somehow "hidden" behind a veil of illusion in some mystical sense), it's very easy for one to not recognize that the mind is starting to fall back into delight and lust towards things in the world (which is to say, delight and lust towards vitakkavicāra). Also, as one gains an increasingly clear recognition of what the actual problem is (i.e., clearly distinguishes the world from the desire and lust towards it), the world often actually gets *more* pressuring/alluring, not less, meaning that it will require even more finesse to keep the mind within the right attitude described in SN 1.1, neither welcoming nor denying the world.

    So despite the mind having become confident in renunciation, as the sutta puts it, if one loses sight of the actual "level" where renunciation needs to be happening, which is already where the "grain" of one's mind is naturally going, or if one simply gets careless, the mind will start slowly drifting back in the direction of sensuality. But that equally takes time, just like developing the withdrawal from sensuality takes time, and thus the joy of renunciation would not somehow evaporate instantaneously-it could even take days for the mind to *fully* fall back to the sensual state. Hence MN 19 says that one inclines the mind through what themes one chooses to dwell on-it works in both directions.

    That's why there's a whole [Saṃyutta](https://suttacentral.net/sn34-jhanavagga?view=normal&lang=en) that describes all the different aspects that one needs to master to as to have full proficiency in samādhi. All of that is just about working on the different subtle ways in which one can fail to recognize that subtle "peripheral attitude" of the mind, what sort of things act as a support for establishing the *right* peripheral attitude, how one falls away from it, etc.

    Things like "being skilled in remaining in samādhi", the subject of SN 34.2, are most certainly not about skill in preventing the mind from wandering off of the one object, as it would usually be contemporarily conceived. That's actually less of an achievement, because ultimately it boils down to luck to a great degree. Some people are never able to reach it while others get it very easily, even by accident.

    What this sutta here is describing though *most certainly* cannot be reached by accident, and the Buddha himself is saying what the primary and indispensable requirement for it is.

    Edit: Obviously, according to his own account in the suttas, the Buddha entered jhāna as a child, but that doesn't mean it was "by accident" in the way absorption upon an object just "happens to you". As he said in AN 6.73, it's impossible to enter jhāna without seeing with proper wisdom the danger in sensuality, meaning that he must've had that recognition already to a great degree. That's exactly why he achieved full enlightenment by himself after just six years of practice, whereas for everyone else, an entire lifetime (and more) wouldn't have been enough to see the Dhamma without any external help.

### Confused as the difference between sati and yoniso manisakara

After watching this video : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI0GVhw0bgs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI0GVhw0bgs) it seems like sati and yoniso manisakara are more or less the same thing and are a bit overlapping, so I must be wrong somewhere...

According to the video sati is remembering the context, in which case how would it be different from yoniso manisakara ?

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/187s9ba/confused_as_the_difference_between_sati_and/kbif492/)** _2023-12-01 05:18:52:

    sati is more general than yoniso manasikāra and everybody has it to some extent. Without it, you basically couldn't do anything. That's why the implicit perception of sati as some new thing you need to start practicing when you become a "meditator" is misguided. People might tell themselves that they always have sati out of common sense, but the practice that they're doing *is* ultimately an artificial construct regardless, and it requires interfering with the way that experience naturally works, which is the same both with and without ignorance.  

    yoniso manasikāra is what turns ordinary sati into actual satipaṭṭhānas and sammāsati, as it allows the recollection to sustain the perspective about the foundation of one's experience, thus opening up the possibility of eventually discerning paṭiccasamuppāda.

    Thus, yoniso manasikāra (and the utterance of another) is the condition for the arising of the Right View (= Right Recollection).

    >Sampajanna : clear awareness/comprehension of what one does. Would that be equivalent to Self-awareness or the reflexive attitude pointed at by Nanavira ?

    Yes, but not in a sense that you start attending "more" to things or something like that. Rather, you become aware of the subtler attitudes of your mind, which is what grasping the sign of the mind means. You recognize the less obvious ways in which you're still welcoming or resisting the enduring feeling, and then you establish the right context that will prevent you from owning that feeling while it's there. That would be memory-and-clear comprehension of the nature of feeling.

    >What do you need to add to the reflexive attitude to make it satisampajanna ?

    The reflexive attitude *is* satisampajaññā. Ñāṇavīra makes the distinction between "reflection" and "reflexion". Basically, satisampajaññā is the later, whereas sati alone is the former, which would range all the way from remembering what you did yesterday to profound philosophical ponderings, all of which are inherently forms of sati/memory. As he puts it, "reflexion" is a stricter form of "reflection", meaning it involves "stepping back" from the currently enduring feeling more acutely, and thus it pulls you back from otherwise abstract thinking.

    You could say for practical purposes that satisampajaññā is essentially sati + a good level of yoniso manasikāra. That's why SN 47.8 says that even satisampajaññā cannot be achieved without grasping the sign of the mind.

### The Non Sensual .. Thought ?

Theruwan saranayai !

This is a question I've had for maybe a month now, but upon being unable still to resolve it myself I will ask it here. 

There is a certain concept I've been seeing talked about in HH videos, as well as sometimes on here, namely the concept: Wholesome is not another "object" (like for example, thoughts of "wishing others well"), but rather, Wholesome is simply clarity in regards to the UNWHOLESOME OBJECT.  

For example, in the video the Ultimate Method for Overcoming Hindrances - ( https://youtu.be/9voIhZij5Io?si=E0hU-wk5sNQhZ5Zq ) at 27:00 minutes in, Sister Medhini mentions how in the Dvedhavitakka Sutta, the Thought of Renunciation/ Non - Sensual Thought is not just another object like the Sensual Thought is.

 Rather, what constitutes the Nekkhamma vitakka/Thought of Renunciation is:

 "the type of THINKING of seeing the danger of the Sensual Thought that has arisen". 

Although it does make sense that an object could not simply be Wholesome in and of itself in its own arising, manifestation, and nature - thoughts that arise about a certain content just so happen to be good, and thoughts about a certain content just so happen to be bad (by that logic, when Arițțha the Vulture Trapper was at some point thinking about the suttas - that was also "wholesome" - since how could thoughts concerning the suttas possibly be bad??) - what I have trouble understanding is this:

1.)  From what I can understand of the Dvedhavitakka Sutta, it seems to imply that the Thought of Renunciation IS in fact, Wholesome IN ITS ARISING and IS a wholesome OBJECT. 

"Then, as I meditated - diligent, keen, and resolute - a thought of renunciation AROSE. I understood: 'This thought of renunciation has ARISEN in me'". 

It doesn't say that intentionally, volitionally THINKING and clarifying the danger of the arisen Sensual Thought is the Thought of Renunciation, but that the thought that ARISES (before and more fundamental to your intentional thinking/contemplation/clarification) is IN ITSELF, in its original nature and manifestation BEFORE your contemplation of it - a Thought of Renunciation.  

In short, the Wholesome Thought is a Wholesome THOUGHT - NOT Wholesome THINKING (which is what contemplating and reflecting upon the danger would be). 

Perhaps I may be conflating this in assuming that for the Thought of Renunciation to be wholesome in its ARISING, Wholesome must therefore be an "object"/ dependent on the content of the thought. Maybe it could be seen instead as - WHATEVER CONTENT that arises regardless of the object, whether it arises/manifests with DESIRE backing it or not - is what determines the nature of the thought? 

2.) If the Thought of Renunciation is really just contemplation of the danger of an arisen Sensual Thought - this renders about half the Dvedhavitakka sutta completely useless and unnecessary. 

The first part of the sutta is about when the Bodhisatta, while meditating, has a Sensual Thought arise in him, and he then contemplates on its danger. 

If this contemplation of the danger of the Sensual Thought - is the Non-Sensual "Thought" in itself, the Bodhisatta could have stopped right here (since he has already explained the two classes of thought). 

But then he also goes on, in the second part, to reflect on the BENEFITS of arisen Thoughts of Renunciation (so if the contemplation of the danger of a Sensual Thought constitutes a Non-Sensual Thought.... what exactly does that make this?). 
- - - 

I will have to mention that all of this may be due to my lack of clarity in regards to Sensual thoughts and what they really are, as well. Maybe this is all wrong and neither the Non-Sensual Thought NOR the Sensual Thought even - are defined by the object of the thought, but simply by the presence/absence of desire? This would seem to sort out the issue? 

I do apologize for my long question and if it is unclear. Thank you!

    What the "wholesome thoughts" are cannot be understood accurately in theory alone because wholesomeness on that level that *arises on its own* is rooted in the present state of mind, which is not in your direct control. On that level, you can't at the same time relate to unwholesome thoughts *and* wholesome thoughts—it has to be one of the two that you exist within at the time. That "level" is what determines where the mind will go if you just relax and don't make any effort. 

    A background unwholesome citta is facing the direction of unwholesome actions by default, including by manokamma, and restraining yourself from that "pull" will be painful. A fully established wholesome state of mind, on the other hand, makes unwholesome actions impossible even if you try to commit them, because losing the perspective of danger is inconceivable for as long as that state lasts, and it makes not acting out of the pull be joyful and satisfying in a way that involves no craving. 

    For instance, choosing to eat the most delicious food instead of something simple could not possibly be rooted in sensual desire at that time unlike before, where you'd have to be extra careful to the point of abstaining from it if the mind is craving for the pleasure, or making sure that there is a valid practical reason for consuming it. You'd be able to experience the full "size" of the pleasure of the delicious food and still see it as a charcoal pit and not crave for it at all, and same with thoughts and memories about sense pleasures in general. (Sexual engagement of any kind remains perpetually and categorically out of bounds though).

    >1.)  From what I can understand of the Dvedhavitakka Sutta, it seems to imply that the Thought of Renunciation IS in fact, Wholesome IN ITS ARISING and IS a wholesome OBJECT. 

    >"Then, as I meditated - diligent, keen, and resolute - a thought of renunciation AROSE. I understood: 'This thought of renunciation has ARISEN in me'".

    Yes, you can imagine it in theory as how much pressure there is to __act__ out of the content (craving) vs. how much pressure the content __is__ by itself (feeling). It is by not seeing the difference between those two that one remains caught up in saṁsāra, pretty much. Not seeing that recognizing that craving is completely gratuitous, while feeling is not optional. And again, that will only be seen once the practice that the Buddha is describing there in MN 19 is brought to fulfilment, so that one can drop the active thinking of renunciation and stay only with the *mental state* of renunciation that is now steady and does not require any maintenance at all. Otherwise, craving and hindrances will always be the mental state to some extent and all of one's active Dhamma reflections will still not be "on the right level".

    >2.) If the Thought of Renunciation is really just contemplation of the danger of an arisen Sensual Thought - this renders about half the Dvedhavitakka sutta completely useless and unnecessary. 

    >The first part of the sutta is about when the Bodhisatta, while meditating, has a Sensual Thought arise in him, and he then contemplates on its danger.

    >But then he also goes on, in the second part, to reflect on the BENEFITS of arisen Thoughts of Renunciation (so if the contemplation of the danger of a Sensual Thought constitutes a Non-Sensual Thought.... what exactly does that make this?). 

    Yes, that second part is also just as important, and it's the same principle as contemplating the benefit of abandoning hindrances shown in Suttas like MN 39.

    Basically, once you start properly contemplating the danger—namely, you are trying to address your gratuitous need to *act out* of the pressure, not the pressure itself—the mind will begin to recognize the danger more by itself when the same things keep arising (i.e. whatever the mind is thinking about which you don't try to interfere with—as the simile goes, the cowherd doesn't put the cows on a leash, he just makes sure they don't eat other people's crops). You then need to actively foster that recognition of benefit so as to solidify that *mental state* of renunciation at the background, not to, again, do something to the *content* in any way.

    Also, you could say that that which the Sutta does not explicitly name, being the contemplation of "this does not lead to my benefit, etc." is the "active thinking" that you are using to, as the Sutta also says, incline that *citta/mental state* in the right direction. Ceasing to make use of that reflection prematurely would entail allowing the wrong mental states to continue. Not realizing that it's that indirect mental state and not the direct experience of feeling and perception that needs to change will also mean no purification of mind, and proliferation of subtle aversion towards feelings instead.

    Furthermore, the part that people often misinterpret, where the Buddha says "this thinking is tiresome, why don't I stop it", has an important nuance in Pāli. The expression is "__anu-__vitakkayato __anu-__vicārayato", and that "anu" is denoting the  "(going) along with" nature of those active reflections, which is tiresome compared to allowing the wholesome mental state coupled with whatever feelings or perceptions arise to endure effortlessly. It does *not* mean that he stopped the vitakkavicāra as such that is paired with renunciation, etc., because that can only be done by either falling back into unwholesome thoughts or by entering the second jhāna.

    >Maybe this is all wrong and neither the Non-Sensual Thought NOR the Sensual Thought even - are defined by the object of the thought, but simply by the presence/absence of desire? This would seem to sort out the issue? 

    Yes, pretty much. Of course, even the senses will eventually incline less to the very coarse objects if the wholesome citta/mental state is protected, but that absolutely does not and should not involve volition on your part. That would be a way of trying to take a shortcut to the second jhāna pretty much, which will make you fall from the first if you had it and [end up with neither](https://suttacentral.net/an9.35/en/sujato).

    At the end of the day, you can speak of wholesome and unwholesome both on the active and the passive level, but it's not perfectly clear cut. If the intention behind the superficially wholesome thoughts is unwholesome, they won't actually be wholesome. And if there is truly a wholesome intention at the back, nothing that arises can be said to be unwholesome *at that moment*. You can also have reached some level of a wholesome mental state, but then allow yourself then attend to sense objects carelessly on a particular level (which will still not be causing any suffering due to the pure mind), and this will gradually incline the mind back into unwholesome.

    [This](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=VBiB0W7U6FQ) and [this](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7DqygBzFlo) are also about this same Sutta.

### Discerning the body

Hello, in *The Only Way to Jhana* Venerable Nyanamoli addresses a chapter about *Discerning the body* as an entity there enduring on its own with his own cravings and that we should be "aware of it as a peripherally enduring bag of skin. An indirect image of the body that contains the sense organs that are attracted to the various types of sense pleasures in their respective domains".

&#x200B;

My "issue" here is that I tend to understand what is meant but not on the level of the body but rather of the brain (or mind).

I feel like I've been partially making myself aware of something peripherally enduring for a long time now with what I call "mental training", essentially *going against the grain* of the mind and "going beyond the limits of what I can endure" or I guess in my mind it was rather trying some watered-down shaolin type of training to become the master of the mind, to be less controlled by it but gain more control over it. Little things like for example when doing sport, by not giving up and enduring when it gets hard physically; or endure the cold until the mind is not bothered by it anymore even though it feels it; or when I feel like the mind gets antsy or frustrated, by not following it where it wants to go.

Also, for a long time now, probably because of our understanding of the self according to science, I was thinking of myself as a brain, a brain which is connected to a body and able to pilote it partially (at least at the level of the muscles).

&#x200B;

And all in all, I tend not to experience that awareness at the level of the body enduring on its own, but rather at the level of the brain, or the mind, enduring everything the body sends to it, on its own. Which translates into, for example, not thinking this is the tongue that wants good feeling with good tasting food but rather the mind that wants to feel delight with good taste by proxy of the tongue, or this is not the body that is cold and wants to be warm, but rather the mind that is averse to the coldness by proxy of the body.

&#x200B;

So I would just like to know if this is a mistake and if this is important that I recalibrate this way of perceiving things to not possibly get things wrong as I go further into the practice, or, if maybe the important point is rather to see something here, over than "me", enduring on its own and pulling me one way or another, be it the body and the senses or the mind by proxy of the body and the senses?

I tend to think that if Ajahn Nyanamoli puts it in those specific terms of "body" and "sense organs" and not of "mind" that's for a good reason, but I would like opinions from people more expert than me on the subject

&#x200B;

Edit: After putting it in writing, pondering about it gets easier and I'm starting to wonder if that was just too nebulous for me, because when I give the example of not giving up when doing physical exercises and that it gets difficult and physical pain arises, this is the mind not giving up by discerning the body as an individual entity going through a painful process, not the mind not giving up by discerning the mind feeling a painful process, right? I'm lost  😅

    >So I would just like to know if this is a mistake and if this is important that I recalibrate this way of perceiving things to not possibly get things wrong as I go further into the practice

    It is, and that's why it's such an issue when people think the views about the practice are irrelevant and dismiss the need to clear out misunderstandings by saying "that's all just thinking" and whatnot, and the only thing that matters is "meditation" (which, in the original, uncorrupted meaning of the word, is literally nothing other than exploring one's views). [Wrong view leads to wrong intention... which leads to wrong knowledge, which leads to wrong liberation.](https://suttacentral.net/an10.105/en/sujato?lang=en)

    Fundamentally, you could say that whatever is an arisen thing, no matter how subtle or ambiguous, is part of your body, whereas your attitudes, views, actions and assumptions in regard to arisen things is where the mind is (citta), and that's why it's always "indirect". You can't "see" your mind in the way of "me here looking at that" in which you perceive even your thoughts. Thus, it's extremely wrong to say that the mind is in the brain, as the brain is a material thing which has its own way of functioning/manifesting, and your mind has attitudes in regard to your body, which includes your brain. This is how an Arahant can get neurological disorders: whatever happens in the brain is what you liberate yourself *from*. Thus, the idea that measurable changes in the brain due to "meditation" are what development of *mind* is is as ignorant as it gets, and that's why that type of meditation—well, even the traditional Buddhist type too in the end, inadvertently—revolves around making your life better, not about abandoning attachment to life.

    
    >I tend to think that if Ajahn Nyanamoli puts it in those specific terms of "body" and "sense organs" and not of "mind" that's for a good reason, but I would like opinions from people more expert than me on the subject

    Yes, and one also must remember that there are two "minds": citta and mano. Mano is a sense base and is thus part of the body/brain and [belongs to Māra](https://suttacentral.net/sn4.19/en/bodhi?lang=en&reference=none&highlight=false), whereas citta is that which gets liberated from Māra.

    >because when I give the example of not giving up when doing physical exercises and that it gets difficult and physical pain arises, this is the mind not giving up by discerning the body as an individual entity going through a painful process, not the mind not giving up by discerning the mind feeling a painful process, right? I'm lost

    You could say either, but with the latter you would need to say that the first mind is citta while the second is mano, i.e. part of the body still (though way subtler, of course).

    >Is *mano* the sixth sense organ?  

    Yes.

    >If so, I thought it was only sensitive to mental phenomena, not bodily ones.

    That's the scientific misinterpretation of experience right there. How can you perceive bodily phenomena (of the five senses) in any way other than as mental phenomena?

    >Friend, these five faculties each have a separate field, a separate domain, and do not experience each other’s field and domain, that is, the eye faculty, the ear faculty, the nose faculty, the tongue faculty, and the body faculty. Now of these five faculties, each having a separate field, a separate domain, not experiencing each other’s field and domain, what is their resort, what experiences their fields and domains?”

    >“Friend, these five faculties each have a separate field, a separate domain, and do not experience each other’s field and domain, that is, the eye faculty, the ear faculty, the nose faculty, the tongue faculty, and the body faculty. Now these five faculties, each having a separate field, a separate domain, not experiencing each other’s field and domain, __have mind (mano) as their resort, and mind experiences their fields and domains.”__

    —MN 43

    >unless that's part of a chain of events I don't clearly discern yet, where bodily phenomenas leads to mental phenomenas being then sensed by *mano*

    The expectation of it being a "chain of events" would be another result of the scientific misinterpretation that regards experience as somehow observable "from the outside", independently of consciousness. Viewing "bodily phenomena" as some sort of self-subsisting entities that exist __before__ you experience them is one of many ways how you would block any opportunity to see paṭiccasamuppāda. 

    It is *because* of your mind (mano) that you get to experience bodily phenomena as bodily phenomena in the first place because there is absolutely no such thing as "bare perception", AKA "raw sense data", an abhorrently fallacious notion. Conversely, it is because the 5 senses are functional and the corresponding objects are given that mano can perceive bodily phenomena.

    In fact, this principle is embedded into the Pali itself: the external counterpart of mano is *dhamma*, meaning "phenomenon/thing" in the most general sense. It's not "mānasika dhamma", meaning "mental phenomena". That's why it's wrong when "dhamma" gets translated as "mental object"—totally just reading alien Cartesian notions into the Pali.

    >In the philosophy of mind, mind–body dualism denotes either the view that mental phenomena are non-physical,[1] or that the mind and body are distinct and separable.[2] Thus, it encompasses a set of views about the relationship between mind and matter, as well as between subject and object, and is contrasted with other positions, such as physicalism and enactivism, in the mind–body problem.[1][2]

    ...And none of the views in that discussion, being outside the Buddha's teaching, involve any recognition of the citta. Thus, whatever distinctions they make between mind and body will be inaccurate, as they will be hopelessly mixing up citta and mano all the time.

    >.“Friend, what can be known by purified mind-consciousness released from the five faculties?”

    >“Friend, by purified mind-consciousness (mano-viññāna) released from the five faculties the base of infinite space can be known thus: ‘Space is infinite’; the base of infinite consciousness can be known thus: ‘Consciousness is infinite’; and the base of nothingness can be known thus: ‘There is nothing.′”

    —MN 43

    This makes clear that the default state is for mind-consciousness/mano to be (inextricably) linked with the five senses, and that's not unwholesome or wrong because an Arahant does not perpetually live in formless attainments. 

    >Does anyone know of a resource on the subject, defining the outlines of *mano*, *citta* and *vinnana,* and maybe the relationship between the 3 please?

    You won't find a "resource" on the level of information, or at least it will hardly take you any further; it needs to be seen for oneself. Especially with citta, no matter how many accurate pointers towards it you get, it's still gonna be another dhamma within mano for as long as you're not trained in proper way of discerning it. Only by learning to live in and enjoy seclusion does one get to recognize where the citta is [(cittassa nimitta)](https://suttacentral.net/an6.68/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin), and enjoying seclusion will not be possible unless one has become accustomed to virtue, non-sensuality, renunciation, and sense restraint beforehand.

    Furthermore, almost the entirety of the problem with contemporary Buddhism is due to the ignorance of the distinction between citta and mano, so you will be hard-pressed to find anyone explaining it accurately these days. And even if it were recognized in theory very rarely, in practice you are very unlikely to find accurate instructions on how to go about discerning the distinction in your own experience, which is what would make you a sotapanna whether you like it or not.

    Nevertheless, some Sutta passages so as to show the nuances of the Pali (obscured in the  common translations) that implicitly show the distinction between these three things:

    >If, friends, internally the mind __(mano)__ is intact but no external phenomena come into its range, and there is no corresponding engagement, then there is no manifestation of the corresponding section of consciousness. If internally the mind is intact and external phemomena come into its range, but there is no corresponding engagement, then there is no manifestation of the corresponding section of consciousness. But when internally the mind is intact and external phenomena come into its range and there is the corresponding [conscious] engagement, then there is the manifestation of the corresponding section of consciousness.

    >***“The form (rūpa) in what has thus come to be is included in the material form aggregate affected by assumption.*** The feeling...  perception... activities... consciousness in what has thus come to be is included in the consciousness aggregate affected by assumption.

    —MN 28

    The highlighted part shows that the experience of phenomena by mano is also material, showing how the idea that mano perceives "only" mental phenomena, as in diametrically opposed to the material, is wrong.

    
    >Bhikkhus, if in any bhikkhu or bhikkhunı̄ desire or lust or hatred or delusion or aversion of mind should arise in regard to forms __cognizable (viññāṇa)__ by the eye, such a one should rein in the __mind (citta)__ from them thus: ‘This path is fearful, dangerous, strewn with thorns, covered by jungle, a deviant path, an evil path, a way beset by scarcity.
    This is a path followed by inferior people; it is not the path followed by superior people. This is not for you.’ In this way the __mind (citta)__ should be held back from forms cognizable by the eye [...]

    >Bhikkhus, if in any bhikkhu or bhikkhunı̄ desire or lust or hatred or delusion or aversion of mind should arise in regard to phenomena __cognizable (viññāṇa)__ by the __mind (mano)__, such a one should rein in the __mind (citta)__ from them thus: ‘This path is fearful, dangerous, strewn with thorns, covered by jungle, a deviant path, an evil path, a way beset by scarcity.
    This is a path followed by inferior people; it is not the path followed by superior people. This is not for you.’ In this way the __mind (citta)__ should be held back from phenomena cognizable by the __mind (mano)__...

    —SN 35.246 (my more literal translation)

    This illustrates also how purification does not involve stopping one's thinking (as in getting rid of the phenomena perceived by mano), as it's clearly saying that what one restrains is the __citta__,  away from the phenomena cognizable by mano, whose arising is not, on the level that matters, [in one's control](https://suttacentral.net/sn4.19/en/sujato?lang=en).

    >Here the "corresponding \[conscious\] engagement" is contact between mano and the sense object, right?

    No, that's still the scientific view where mano and the sense object are supposedly conceivable by you *before* the contact. You can "see" contact happening from the outside only by introducing totally new sense objects to another persons senses, but when it comes to your own, the only way you can relate to either the sense orgam itself or the external object at any given time is the contact that *already* happened, allowing you to be exploring how it came about in the first place. If the contact were not already there, you couldn't even designate it or describe it, let alone say where it came from, as that designation and exploration is an *intention*, and [intention originates from contact](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.93/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin).

    
    >What does "affected by assumption" mean here? The only time I heard about assumptions from Ajahn Nyanamoli's teachings was when one assume the body to be "me, mine, myself" and put it second, is it this idea that is conveyed here?

    I explained the logic behind that translation [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/16hud0c/upadana_as_assumption/).

    >Here (the "mind" put in bold) I notice that you didn't make the distinction between mano or citta, and I don't see either of those in the pali version, and I was wondering why? Can these mental formations be cognizable by mano but not arising "from" mano or citta? Are these conditionned thoughts and feelings arising "on their own"?˙

    Actually, I should have highlighted perhaps even more than everything else but I missed it. "cetaso" is the genitive of citta, so that's what it's referring to there. It already implies that one needs to be able to discern the difference between *aversion of citta*, which is always defilement for sure, and an unpleasant phenomenon pertaining to *mano*, which in itself will bring intentions of "shying away" with it, so to speak. As in, even for an Arahant, the displeasure of a grave illness has the same directionality that points him to look for a potential cure, so one needs to be able to differentiate *that*, which is fine (as when Buddha himself sought treament when ill) and *aversion*, which is the assumption that you're entitled not to experience unpleasant feelings, and you *suffer* if you're not able to resolve the situation as soon as you desire.

### what is distraction and delusion?

HH always talk about Greed Aversion and distraction/delusion. And also talk against practice of focusing on one meditation object.

So If there is no predefined meditation object. how to discern distraction?. Distraction from what ?

and similarly how to discern delusion.

&#x200B;

    >So If there is no predefined meditation object. how to discern distraction?. Distraction from what ?

    There is no predefined "object" in the sense that narrowing down the scope of your attention *is* a form of delusion already, meaning that that's not (right) meditation.

    "Distraction" has in itself nothing to do with the movement of your thoughts towards this or that. True distraction is when your thoughts move towards this or that ***and*** you lose the fundamental context behind those things you are attending to, being that they're impermanent, suffering and not worth appropriating. Otherwise, an Arahant would have to have some sort of perpetually constricted awareness so as to not be deluded/distracted, and constricting your awareness *even more* within the artificial environment that "sitting meditation" usually entails for people can't possibly train your mind to be free from distraction in every possible situation. Rather, it misconceives a *particular kind of situation* (of a focused mind that has limited perceptions) as non-distraction, meaning your mind is distracted/deluded in regard to *that* simply due to taking that "meditative state" for granted.

    So you abandon distraction/delusion by questioning your attitude behind whatever experience is already there, not by trying to have non-distraction as an *positive experience* in itself, which is impossible. The wholesome states are always "negatives".

### Has anyone in HH read Bhikkhu Bodhi's answer to Nanavira Thera's "A note on Paticcasamuppad" ?

I don't have the skill required to assess the validity of this answer or to critique it but if someone already has I'd be happy to read it !

The answer of Bhikkhu Bodhi is here starting at page 40 and mostly takes aim at the one life DO understanding of Nanavira Thera :

[https://www.bps.lk/olib/bp/bp437s\_Bodhi\_Investigating-Dhamma.pdf](https://www.bps.lk/olib/bp/bp437s_Bodhi_Investigating-Dhamma.pdf)

Edit : Going down this rabbit hole I also found Bhikkhu Analayo's article on Nanavira here :

    Apart from having failed at grasping the actual context of the argument and addressing only superficial points instead, Bhikkhu Bodhi (and critics in general) don't realize that the paṭiccasamuppāda "interpretation" of Ñāṇavīra actually includes the phenomenon of "rebirth" (a word that does not exist in Pali and usually carries wrong connotations) in a *simpler* manner, without needing to introduce alien notions that are nowhere found in the Suttas, and are inevitably there when you think in terms of a three life interpretation. 

    One of the main problems with that is the fact that the idea of anattā then becomes contradictory, as the "progression" of the paṭiccasamuppāda factors it's effectively implying that thee is *some* sort of phenomenon that goes from one life to the next, while at the same time saying the fact that there is "no lasting entity" is what anattā is (which isn't the case). They then have to resort to this simile of the candle to say that "the first candle lights up the next one, but the fire us not the same", failing to see that there *is* still something being "transferred" there (literally, even in physics you can't create energy, so the energy of the first candle is what moves on to the next). In essence, it's implicitly *positing* an idea of self and then proceeding to deny it because that obviously contradicts the letter of the Buddha's teaching.

    Ñāṇavīra's interpretation, on the other hand, is so general and phenomenologically acute that you don't even need to go to the end of the sequence to "explain" how this life is not the last. Every single pair of factors is already in itself showing the principle of "rebirth" in a way that also simultaneously prevents even the suggestion of a self, while also not denying the obvious fact that there *is* some enduring identity.

    (See Ñāṇavīra's note on ATTĀ explaining how the self-identity of things has nothing to do with anattā).

    Edit: Also, I should add that the polar opposite of the three life interpretation, which is that it's all just a "process" happening here and now as experience unfolds, a la Thanissaro Bhikkhu, is equally wrong because it still involves time, just in a much shorter scale. As well, the connection to the endless wandering in saṃsāra is tenuous, as there is no inherent reason why the process should "start again", if you have supposedly stopped it by practicing meditation momentarily as a puthujjana, which is a common misconception that terribly waters down paṭiccasamuppāda.

    Ñāṇavīra's interpretation is the Middle Way between these two misguided extremes.

### Not acting out of the pressure

Hello, I will probably come off as a lunatic but I'm tempted to ask this question anyway to advance in my practice and clear the path, it should be known that my mind as a tendancy to overthink a good bit.

&#x200B;

The next four paragraphs are just to set the context but are probably not necessary for my issue if you want to skip them:

Lately I've been starting to read Ajahn Nyanamoli's *The Only way to Jhana* and to train for the gradual training. I'm at the second stage, doing sense-restraint, though I'm not sure of the criterion to know that I'm "seeing danger in the slightest fault" and therefore to know if I'm qualified to go to this next step. I just tend to summarize that danger by the fact that :

'It leads to hurting myself, hurting others, and hurting both. It blocks wisdom, it’s on the side of anguish, and it doesn’t lead to extinguishment.' ([MN 19](https://suttacentral.net/mn19/en/sujato))

So I'm trying to detect when I feel the pressure of wanting to get or feel something pleasant; or of wanting to get rid of an unpleasant phenomenon; or to do something that's not urgent or only in order to distract myself with non dhamma related subjects.

I also read the eighth essay "The pleasure of boredom" and so I thought the stage of sense restraint was quite compatible with the training of doing nothing, letting the mind wander around, allowing thoughts to come up and letting them endure without trying to get rid of them or cast them aside (as I reflexively often do) even when they are leading to unpleasant sensations, seeing them for what they are, sometimes as unpleasant phenomena that I don't really want.

&#x200B;

So let's say one caused harm or bothered someone without even noticing it and without any bad intentions and during one's sense-restraint training the person to whom one have caused harm retaliates in one way or another by indirect means, and the thought came up to one to dissipate any unexpressed and unneeded tensions by clearing things up with the person instead of doing nothing.

&#x200B;

What I'm questionning about is: in the context of sense-restraint and not acting out of pressure of the senses, since the need to act come from pressure from the mind, should one still act to dissipate the possible tensions/grudges or should one let those thoughts (thoughts that there might be grudges and to dissipate the grudges) endure until they eventually pass away, without taking action in order to cultivate dispassion towards these mind-phenomena even if it mean not diffusing a grudge?

All that in order to eventually not even be moved by the possible repercussions of such grudge anymore? Grudges not being my responsability (not being in my control as opposed to how I react to such repercussions) even though I could try to act to lessen them.

&#x200B;

In the end, should the aim of one rather be to cultivate dispassion towards these unpleasant thoughts all together, to eventually attain extinguishment, or should one rather cultivate good-will and harmlessness towards others even if it means acting out of unpleasant thoughts and feelings you decided to not act out of in the first place?

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/183fm82/not_acting_out_of_the_pressure/kapitmy/)** _2023-11-25 15:54:14:

    >All this could sound silly or over the top but it bring the question: should one cultivate dispassion towards these unpleasant thoughts, to eventually attain extinction, or should one rather cultivate good-will and harmlessness towards others even if it means acting out of thoughts you decided to not act out of in the first place?

    The problem here is that before having the Right View, one cannot even fully fathom what "cultivating dispassion" actually means, because one does not see what *passion* is to begin with (2nd Noble Truth) on the right level and with clarity.

    So yes, one should cultivate dispassion in every situation, but if you try to go all-in with that now, you will end up mechanically trying to just "deal" with individual thoughts and the way they make you feel, rather than *your craving and defilements* in regard to how they make you feel, because the signs of the mind have not been sufficiently discerned, [meaning that abandoning defilements is not possible](https://suttacentral.net/SN47.8/en/sujato). All one can do without seeing those signs is *suppress* the craving and—whether one is aware of it and thinks of it like that or not—that's not the practicė˙. So first you need to never forget that you still don't see what dispassion is, because of which will feel like at some point it's too much (which is not the case for actual dispassion on the "right level").

    Moreover, true good-will and harmlessness are only possible from a dispassionate perspective, so it would be wrong to think that trying to develop dispassion is somehow "different" to developing mettā. If your dispassion is not resulting in complete lack of aversion, which is what mettā is, not "loving kindness", then it's not pure dispassion; it's tainted with aversion and cynicism.

    In this case, going out and trying to amend worldly circumstances to make people feel better has nothing to do with mettā. Mettā is about not resisting, not trying to get rid of the discomfort that *you are feeling* on account of other beings. That should be your only goal, and then, when the mind is fully established in the theme of non-aversion towards all upsetting cirucumstances you may possibly experience, *whatever* you do, even if it's nothing, will be rooted in kindness. But if you try to reach the kindness through doing the external actions *first*, that's putting the cart before the horse.

    Also, keep in mind that you can't possibly be analyzing which "stage' you're at, how long until the next one, etc. (and all that generally sounds like an overly achievement-oritented mindset that will lead to turning the Dhamma into something excessively clear-cur and methodical). The training is about sticking to the things that will over time make the signs of the mind become apparent on their own. That's not something you can have a direct say in. The most direct influence you have over your "progress" is whether you allow yourself to engage with things that you know are rooted in craving. 

    If you *never* do that, then you can be sure that however slowly or quickly the practice may be unfolding, this is the highest "speed" that is possible.

    >I get from this that I should only focus on cravings and aversions for now until being able to endure the phenomena that used to bring cravings and aversions, or rather endure all phenomena at least regarding other beings, and not be upset by them anymore

    >Then once there is no bothering whatsoever there is no possible way for harmfulness caused by a resistance to bothering

    Yes, that's pretty much it. However, in order to accomplish that, first it needs to become clear what craving and aversion (and thus the true "bother") even is, and that's something you don't simply "figure out". *Recognizing* the defilements is already like 99% of the work, contrary to the popular belief that we already know what craving is (implicitly and inadvertently acting as if we are all sotapannas from the start) and now we just have to keep performing these practices until it all just clicks together in some magical way.

    If you actually recognize defilements, you can literally just abandon them by accurately recollecting the "extent" of the current defilement (as a peripheral context, not as an object) phenomenologically and concretely in your experience, because defilements are maintained by nothing other than *ignorance*. You can do "more" like contemplating danger and developing dispassion and so on, but it should never feel like you're trying to "deal" and "respond" to stuff as it arises because that will always be rooted in subtle aversion and lack of endurance. It's more like you're sitting on a shore and waves (some tsunamis, some small) are coming to you, and you need to learn how to stop getting hit by them, not start trying to wrestle with the ocean or alter its workings.

    >gradually make them an important part of your life, cultivating them, and not 'gradually' in the sense one stage after another in a methodical way.

    I suppose you could try to "gradually" become used to them if that's what you mean. But it should also be understood as further refinements of the same thing—not acting out of unwholesome states—which starts with virtue and ends with jhāna, which is the same principle on a mental level where it's way subtler and easier to over-do or under-do. They're not like different "components" that are unrelated to each other.

    You also won't even be aware of which one you're "doing" if you're practicing properly and not just sticking to rituals and vows. You only know that you're not acting out of unwholesome states fundamentally. That's why in some Suttas some "steps" are omitted altogether, and virtue goes directly into right recollection and jhāna.

    >But after this answer of yours I am wondering if this really is accurate in our interpretation of Buddhism because this description doesn't mention recognizing the defilements, or maybe you were refering to the 'attachments of rites and rituals' of actively dealing with thoughts as an object?

    Well yes, of course it's not gonna be mentioned verbatim all the time, but it's implicit in so many teachings in the Suttas. For instance, the most classic which is the Four Noble Truths has implicit in it the idea that to the extent you have *recognized* what the problem even is, you are already free from it. [So you can't see the 2nd NT without seeing the 3rd](https://suttacentral.net/sn56.30/en/sujato). That "recognition", if it happens on the right level, which the puthujjana does not have access to, is the destruction of ignorance, and with that, everything else has to fall away, as the paṭiccasamuppāda "sequence" illustrates.

    >Though yes, I must admit I too am guilty of that — maybe not thinking I'm a sotapanna because of the 'abandonned identity view' of that wikipedia page and I'm still trying to figure out how could that be achieved — but I tend to think I had already one foot on the path from the get go without even knowing it (and kind of lost on it), one of the reasons of such belief is that I am pretty sure I can recognize and see to some extent the signs of the mind after having battled with restlessness (what I see as anxiety and worriness) and ill-will/hatred (mostly by way of frustration), though maybe less so, or not yet enough, to the other 3 defilements

    Yes, this is one of the main obstacles: the keenness that all of us have in the beginning, especially as Westerners I suppose, to be able to *feel* for ourselves as soon as possible, even if we don't say it or explicitly think it, that we're already *somewhere* on the Path. Even if when pressed, one admits to not being a sotāpanna, the fact is that there is this deeply rooted reluctance and discomfort in the face of the idea that whatever one is doing (for many years, especially) until stream entry *has* to be wrong, and not being able to stick to the practice *through* that recognition ensures that at some point one will overestimate oneself (again, not necessarily in claiming an attainment all the way, but in simply not being distrustful and realistic enough, you could say "humble", about one's own practice and abilities). And that's already a result of not recognizing the signs of the mind, since it would otherwise be seen to be a defilement, a form of delusion, and thus be abandoned. 

    The idea of the signs of the mind can make sense, and some people naturally see those signs more than others even without having practiced at all (the people with "little dust in their eyes" the Buddha talked about). But one has to tell oneself that even if at all makes sense and one seems to be getting "results", a little dust is no better than a lot compared to perfectly clear vision (i.e., that of a sotāpanna). That's what "humility" is essentially: it's not about *denying* or *hiding* your good qualities, but about always insisting that __it's never even remotely enough__, even if you are second only to the Buddha like Ven. Sāriputta.

    >Bhikkhus, I have personally known two things: __non-contentment in regard to wholesome qualities__ and indefatigability in striving. I strove indefatigably, [resolved]: ‘Willingly, let only my skin, sinews, and bones remain, and let the flesh and blood dry up in my body, but I will not relax my energy so long as I have not attained what can be attained by manly strength, energy, and exertion.’ It was by heedfulness that I achieved enlightenment, bhikkhus; it was by heedfulness that I achieved the unsurpassed security from bondage.
    —AN 2.5

    The opposite, "contentment with wholesome qualities" is what sneaks up on people, because of which they are not harsh enough with themselves. And you *absolutely* do not want to ever be in that position of any degree of contentment and satisfaction with your practice before you are a sotāpanna, because it's so easy to get stuck there, *not knowing* that you're stuck there since a puthujjana doesn't recognize their own shortcomings and defilements by definition.

    >Is the *"extent" of the current defilement* having a sense of knowing or feeling where this is going to lead to before it had the chance to lead you there?

    That's one way of presenting the *theory* of it, but the point is that no matter how much that makes sense, for every puthujjana, (relatively) subtle defilements of one kind of another are always *necessarily* escaping their grasp. So you might've seen the principle in the case of like coarse sensual desires or full-on anger, but the less obvious ways in which the same exact principle is still there has to be unclear without the Right View. Point being, when a puthujjana "recognizes" one defilement, there is necessarily a "new" defilement *somewhere* that they don't see. They by definition can't recognize the *entire domain* of defilement so that the whole thing actually "ceases" even for a moment. Hence I used the word "extent" to specifically describe the true understanding (and the paṭiccasamuppāda "against the grain" always begins with, "with the ***complete*** fading and cessation of ignorance..."; that applies even to the sotapanna whenever they're being heedful and making use of their wisdom correctly, but never for a puthujjana).

    Also, "where this is going to lead to" needs to be seen on the same level of the sign of the mind, as in how giving in to this defilement will incline the citta in a certain direction, not in terms of "if I pursue gain then I'll have to work hard to maintain it and that's dukkha" kind of thing. From what I've seen, a lot of the people who do meditation techniques can't go further than this. But even if you're not *that* wrong and you start getting an inkling of how *giving in* to defilements affects the mind, and what "being affected even means, you need to always tell yourself that that inkling is insufficient and is nothing at all to rest with.

    I guess this is how you could put it: one needs to stay perpetually "on one's toes" in regard to one's practice to ensure that that premature contentment never sets in. And to the extent you don't see the signs of your mind, you don't see the signs of your own resting and sitting down prematurely instead while it's happening.

    Edit: 

    >They by definition can't recognize the *entire domain* of defilement so that the whole thing __actually "ceases"__ even for a moment

    Just in case, with this I don't mean some sort of special, palpable "experience" that comes to you where your mind goes blank or something like that. That "cessation" is in itself something that, say, if hypothetically a puthujjana were to experience "by accident" (which of course is impossible if it's the real thing and they're still puthujjanas), they would not *see* that that is Nibbāna. They would instead be craving for some sort of esoteric, out-of-this-world, "more palpable" meditative experience where they become so unaware of everything that suffering ceases (and this already is underlied by their lust for pleasure).

    Nibbāna and saṃsāra look the same *on the surface* (the 6 senses/5 aggregates doing what they always do), and since all a puthujjana sees is that "surface", even if in some alternate universe puthujjanas could "experience" Nibbāna for a moment they wouldn't even recognize it (that's why MN 1 speaks of conceivings even in regard to Nibbāna).

    >“Here, bhikkhus, an untaught ordinary person, who ***does not see*** the noble ones and is unskilled and untrained in their Dhamma, and does not see true men and is unskilled and untrained in their Dhamma...

    —MN 1

    (Note: Had to correct the translation, which illustrates the very point I'm making. It was originally "who has no regard for noble ones", implying that the ordinary person *can* recognize them but just doesn't respect them or something like that, but the Pāli *literally* says "does not see" (adassāvī). That distortion is an example of the insistence on exactly that wrong view that doesn't put the Dhamma "far above" enough from the puthujjana, forcing them to actually *elevate themselves* towards it instead of bringing it down to where they are).

    >I'm kind of afraid of when the early enthusiasm I'm experiencing right now, ready to go all out in the practice, will inevitably fade, as I know my mind as the habit to be enthusiast at the beginning, then slowly lose interest in the matter to go find enthusiasm somewhere else, though I feel like Theravada Buddhism is the doctrine that could suit me and that I've been looking for all along, there is probably going to be a point where the tentation to become more lenient and just ending up "being lukewarm" in the practice will present itself.

    That's true, and that's why it's so important not to ride that wave of enthusiasm carelessly. The practice should not depend on *wanting* to do the practice in the same way one wanted to pursue sensuality. It should depend only on the recognition, which will need to be increasingly solidified over time, that *not* practicing the Dhamma is absolutely not in your best interest.

    Once that recognition is sufficiently strong, it becomes *impossible* to not want to practice the Dhamma, even on days where you have no inspiration, so to speak. In the end you can never wish suffering for yourself (you can only on the surface, but never at the *core*), so from then on you see that the only thing that *actually* causes suffering in this world is lack of development in the Dhamma, and it's impossible to regard something else as more worthy of effort (not to say that you never do anything mundane, but you'll never have that attitude of thinking that "you'll be fine" without the Dhamma; a sotāpanna is incapable of that and gets heedless sometimes because of the degree that they *already have* the Dhamma and do not need to actively maintain it at all so as to not suffer).

    >Presented like that it seems like one or multiple defilements, do you know these "journeys through the desert"? Do you think this is just something to be learned to be endured like the rest, see it for what this is (especially already knowing what this is going to lead to) and just not act upon it even if it lasts one month or more? Or something to act upon to "revive the embers" towards the Dhamma, strive to keep and refine the right context?

    The unwillingness of the mind to practice needs to be *endured*, in the same way you would endure any other mood without trying to interfere with it through aversion. That's because even if you manage to "revive the embers" sucecessfully *every time* (which is practically impossible), you practice will always be dependent on a *mood* of inspiration, and you don't want that at all—you want to be independent of all moods. You want to be able to not act out of unwholesome regardless of what mood is there, be it inspired or uninspired. Only then can you know that you've truly seen the danger in unwholesome to the sufficient degree.

### Formal Practice to help in day to day life

 How can a beginner incorporate a formal practice that will help in enduring the intense pressure arising during the day to day life while acting according to “ seeing danger in the slightest fault”? Could endurance during formal sit in a controlled environment help in endurance during day to day life? Any practical advices? 

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/182ss21/formal_practice_to_help_in_day_to_day_life/kamlqvq/)** _2023-11-24 23:21:41:

    To add to what u/bodily_heartfulness wrote:

    The very act of considering to take up a "formal practice" is already something you would not be "seeing the danger in the slightest fault" in regard to if you just take that idea at face value and go with it, assuming that it can't possibly be unwholesome (because it's about practice, right?).

    That serves to illustrate the gratuitous divide between "formal" and "everday" practice which causes you to  exclude certain choices from your attempts to flush out greed, aversion and delusion. On the basis of that, you may well be able to abandon almost all coarse, *external* acts rooted in unwholesome intentions, which very dedicated technique-meditators are often able to do, but the entire thing for them would still be underlied by their attitudes towards the "formal practice" which they exempted from investigation and careful "observation" in the same way they spend their time observing irrelevant *sense objects*.

    Thinking about the ways in which you're still acting out by body and speech in unwholesome ways and then reflecting on *why* such actions should be avoided , not just taking it as a sense of duty, until you feel no desire to commit those actions anymore is a practice everyone should be doing. It will be abstract in the beginning and you will probably just be giving overly rationalized reasons without actually seeing the danger of defilement within yourself, but over time , especially if you make the effort to restrain the actions anyway, you get to see the "right level" where contemplation should apply and where it ceases to be abstract. That means it begins to work every single time  at purifying the mind, to the point where all you'd need to do to put defilements to rest is think/remember (sati), regardless of what you're occupied with (unless it's unwholesome, of course).

    >Is it then possible for someone who is not a monk to attain stream entry without engaging in the formal practice of the Anapanasati Sutta?

    Not only that: a layperson who is not restrained from sensuality in their daily life will not be able to practice (the Buddha's) Anapanasati. Something many people generally don't know know today is that the Buddha is never shown teaching Anapanasati to laypeople in the Suttas, as several instances make clear that profound teachings were not given to the laity back then. They had way stronger faculties than us today, given how they so often reached stream entry on account of hearing one discourse (and people today remain unenlightened after a lifetime of practice and learning the Dhamma), and yet they didn't receive Anapanasati instructions even *after* their stream entry, but things like [this](https://suttacentral.net/an11.12/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin) instead. Anapanasati was also most certainly not involved involved in their stream entry, as that is a Buddhist teaching, and they were most often listening to the Dhamma for the first time. They made the breakthrough on account of *understanding*, not on account of a meditative experience.

    If you read carefully, for example in MN 56, you see that what led them to stream entry was that the mind was first confident in the renunciation of sensual pleasures, and there was no "formal" practice involved—they simply heard the Four Noble Truths after the mind was settled in that absence of interest in sensuality (and they were listening to a Dhamma talk, meaning that achieving that relative freedom from hindrances did not involve what people think it does, but rather recognizing the danger of sensual pleasures as the Buddha pointed it out to them).

    Anapanasati is an [advanced practice](https://suttacentral.net/sn54.11/en/sujato?lang=en), so if one is actually succeeding in it (and not something else that's not relevant), there must be equally advanced results to show for it, such as abandonment of sensuality not just at the present instant of "formal practice" (just as a person might find themselves not wanting sensuality when they have something else to keep them occupied) but in the future as well. And this is the [*basic* development of it,](https://suttacentral.net/sn54.6/en/sujato?lang=en) without going into the full description of the Anapanasati Sutta.

    >If a layperson does succeed in attaining permanent abandonment of sensuality, can they go on to practice the Buddha's Anapanasati?

    Certainly. Ultimately the robe doesn't matter; it's the total absence of commitment to the pursuit sensual pleasures that matters. 

    Such a person would be incapable of doing anything *but* the Buddha's Anapanasati, as all other practices that fall outside his teaching don't do so because of some methodical nuance as people might think, but because they don't actually address sensual craving at its root, and instead just shift it over to a much subtler level where it can be satisfied *more reliably* than the craving for coarse sensual objects. As [AN 11.9](https://suttacentral.net/an11.9/en/sujato?lang=en) shows, the only right meditation is when the hindrances, the foremost being sensual desire, are completely transcended.

    >I should perhaps mention that I ask this as a retired, very private single person 80 years of age living alone with no living relatives.

    In such a case it would be particularly important to remember that the hindrances are *one domain* (see "Truth about the Five Hindrances" in [Dhamma Within Reach](https://www.hillsidehermitage.org/dwr/), and that the 5 specific "types" are just particular symptoms of one and the same thing. In later stages of life the symptom of sensual desire will tend to stop manifesting itself, as even the highest degree of pleasure that can derived from engagement with the senses is comparatively little.

    It is then the other 4 "symptoms" (aversion, sluggishness/lethargy, anxiety-and-worry, and doubt) which one will need to look out for to see whether one's mind is truly developing or not. Anapanasati or any other practice should then be aimed at *enduring* the pressure of aversion without being averse, for example, instead of trying to generate a new, more comfortable experience where the same pressure is not there.

    This latter way of practice shares the same principle as sensuality, as when you give in to the pursuit of a sensual object, you do it so as to wriggle out of the pressure it exerts on the mind. Thus, both actions rooted in sensuality *and* that type of meditation make the mind more feeble rather than more imperturbable, and that is exactly the "wild cold meditation" that AN 11.9 is referring to. 

    It doesn't say that there is *no* meditation happening and that's why the five hindrances are there (i.e., that *any* meditation clears up the five hindrances, a wrong view that seems to be common), but that the meditation being performed remains within the domain of the hindrances.

### Reflection on a daily basis

Throughout the day I try to reflect on my thoughts as per the dhamma that I 'am learning from ven Bhikkhu Anigha, ven Thaniyo Thero and ven Ajahn Nyanamoli. How I 'am trying to reflect is the beginning, endurance and the end (without thinking or going into details of the thought). But there are so many thoughts that arises, and I get distracted to which one I should reflect on. Then I tried the main / strong thoughts that arises out of sensuality and anger etc. Is this the correct way?

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/181btzn/reflection_on_a_daily_basis/kadgbyk/)** _2023-11-23 00:12:44:

    Don't approach this through the usual attitude of trying to "observe" things that is present in almost all forms of contemporary meditation. That would ensure that whatever you are discerning is irrelevant to the Four Noble Truths.

    When the Suttas talk about "arising, enduring and ending" that's not to be understood as a linear process that you can, as an uninvolved witness, watch as you would a projectile being launched into the air and falling. The reason for that is simple: if the thought has truly *ended*, you would not be able to recognize that it has ended. In order to say *anything* about a thought, including the fact that it has supposedly disappeared, you need to be thinking it still, which means it's still there.

    In the case of the arising, it's impossible for you to say "when" the thought arose, because time itself is measured by the endurance of whatever you're thinking, meaning that there is no way for you to conceive of a time when a particular thought was not there at least as a possibility. Even if you look at the past, you will be doing so through the thoughts that you have right now, meaning that those thoughts will now be the way in which you experience those memories, regardless of the fact that those thoughts "arose" later from an external, objective, and irrelevant scientific viewpoint.

    It's important to abandon the view that thoughts are "in my head", which is what would incline one towards these gratuitous misapplications of science to the domain of the mind and consciousness. Rather, "thoughts" are phenomena in the most general sense, including the perceptions of your five senses that you may not be engaging in a narrative about. So even if you supposedly shut up your thinking and just have pure perceptions, *you're still thinking* (this is why the view that meditation is meant to stop or even diminish your thinking is so ridiculously wrong: it's rooted in the ignorance of the extent of what a thought/vitakkavicāra really is, meaning that the __whole__ "jhāna sequence" that those "meditators" are going through is actually not even the first jhāna―which is the comprehension of the full extent of thinking as it happens―no matter how special and blissful it may all feel).

    Instead, recognize that whatever "thought" is there right now, you are totally enclosed within and you have no way of knowing when it started or when it will end. As well, you need to take it on the most general sense, on the level of what thought is currently pressuring you and being felt the most. So when you're sitting there "watching" these thoughts supposedly coming and going without your involvement, there is actually a thought behind *all of that* that is not being recognized, a thought of "I want to be doing this practice" for example, and that is being ignored. Such thoughts are also there the entire time when people are supposedly not thinking and focusing on an object instead.

    The "arising" of that more general thought that truly matters and where your craving and actions are cannot possibly be something you pinpoint, because as soon as you start "observing it" like that, it won't be the more general thought anymore, and *another one* will be behind it, whose arising you now overlooked, and so on ad infinitum. 

    But to actually get to see this correctly, I would advise not even trying to think in terms of thoughts in general for now, and instead use things like the recollection of the body to "outline" the nature of thoughts. Instead of going "into" the thoughts to investigate them and start categorizing them and measuring them, use the recognition of the body as a peripheral anchor to see that *whatever* you may be thinking about, with no regard whatsoever for its *content*, is still a thought, defining "thought" as any phenomenon, internal or external, light or heavy, inferior or superior, coarse or subtle, clear or ambiguous that is secondary to this body, and that changes in various ways while the body remains mostly the same.

    Pair this with what I wrote above that it's the thoughts were the craving and pressure are that matter, and thus it's not about observing every little secondary perception that comes up about this or that like the sound of the birds or the memories of what you were doing yesterday (unless those memories start exerting emotional pressure). That's why it's always about recognizing the "intentions behind one's actions", meaning you start to see those peripheral thoughts that you're welcoming and taking for granted, and start to include *that* as well as secondary to the body and remove the perversion of the right order. Without that (which means seeing the signs of the mind), you will just be seeing that random, irrelevant perceptions that have nothing to do with craving are secondary to the body.

    Edit: Regarding how contemporary meditators are not actually even in the first jhāna, that's what I meant with [this](https://reddit.com/comments/17owo0t/comment/k82c6qd) comment which some people seem to have misunderstood. It's not that the *content* of the experience is not changing (and because content is what our intentions influence, that content can very well become just what you expect based on what you know about jhānas). It's the fact that that background level of the *domain* of thinking and pondering has not been transcended at any point, *because*, ironically, of the starting point of wanting to suppress the thinking.

    >By re-reading I'm also wondering if this is not a mistake of trying to keep being conscious of the peripheral at all times or when it's not needed which leads to this overfocusing, rather than only "forcing" or "recollecting" the consciousness of that peripheral when a pressure for greed, aversion or distraction is felt on the mind to enable the mind to not stay enclosed in that thought pressuring it but put the pressure in perspective and allow dispassion for it?

    This is the answer. The only purpose of all this is to overcome greed, aversion and delusion. One does not do it for its own sake and constantly like a "meditation" method, in which case it will be rooted in craving and constitute excessive, "overtight" effort, using the simile of the lute that needs to be neither too tight nor too lose.

    You will also have to resist the tendency to try to "figure it out", because whatever you manage to "grab" with your intellect like that will not be the peripheral, and you will be overlooking it whenever you try that.

    Think about "the peripheral" not as something that comes from *you doing it*, but as something that the mind "keeps" there for you by itself when you train it. You "train it" through virtue, sense restraint and then trying to practice yoniso manasikara within that whenever defilements arise internally, correcting mistakes in your way of recollecting the context as they are gradually recognized over a *long* period of time.

    For example, the danger in sensuality would become "the peripheral" of every beautiful sense object you come across once you have trained in first *not acting towards* those objects, and second by repeatedly remembering (sati) their nature and the unnecessary suffering that craving for them brings about, *without* trying to get rid of the objects, in which case you would be making the context a new foreground to replace the old one, and the true context behind *that* is now one of craving, aversion and lack of endurance.

    >by forcefully (1) not act towards the object and (2) remembering their nature and the unnecessary suffering

    The first one which pertains to body and speech should be "forceful", the second one which pertains to the mind should be just forceful enough, not more, hence the "right tuning" of the strings.

    
    >and with the aim of eventually adopting new reflexes when facing sense objects leading to greed, aversion, distraction that you come across.
    >Is it a misunderstanding? I can't help but associate this process with science understanding of the mind, and the training being a way to remove and replace old neural pathways (habits) by new ones, but as I understood from previous answers of yours, the understanding of the mind by science might not be completely accurate (with regard to citta for example) and therefore this way of seeing it might be wrong (or maybe the misunderstanding of science towards the mind is not relative to that subject in particular?)

    It *is* a misunderstanding. You can't change your "reflexes" or "neural pathways" completely, and sometimes not at all, which would mean that something that's not in your control would force you to be lustful, averse and deluded, and that's luckily impossible, which is why Arahantship *is* possible. That's why it's "beings are owners of their actions", and not "reflexes *make* beings commit actions and thus they are not really the owners of them". Furthermore, attempting to modify your reflexes is what we call ["management" as opposed to *uprooting* of suffering.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zndwMKAszWM&pp=ygUII2R1a2hhaW4%3D), and it's what people nowadays confuse with "equanimity".

    Different reflexes and neural pathways are what distinguish one Arahant from another, and none of that has anything to do with what makes them enlightened. The citta that is liberated is the dispassion towards reflexes (which are an affair of the six senses) that is developed by first not acting out of the reflexes in unskilful ways and then by understanding that entire sense domain and its tendencies as impermanent, suffering and unownable. This is basically the subject of [this whole discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/17v0cqw/re_the_foundational_reality_of_humans_as_primates/).

    >That's probably just overthinking and not important for the practice in itself but that's raising interrogations on my understanding of the mind according to buddhism and some clarifications would be very welcome

    Yes, it can be a form of overthinking if you think that it will fundamentally change the practice in any way. Theoretical understanding has its place, but it doesn't take precedence over not acting out of unpleasant feeling (which includes doubt) here and now. If you practiced the latter long enough and properly, views about science and similar would not be seen as "wrong" but as simply irrelevant, no matter how true they may be. Whatever science describes is within that which you're *overcoming* through practice. Science can therefore not even hope to describe what Nibbāna is: the overcoming of the entire world and the science that describes it, if you want to call it that. 

    Psychology also can only lay out the irrelevant content of that which you need to be dispassionate towards (emotions and ideas), never the *practice* towards that dispassion nor the nature of feeling and views in general. So the Dhamma is also the overcoming of psychology, not a "form of" psychology, a *catastrophic* water down of what it really is.

    >However, what almost always happens in this process of restraint for me is that after some time has passed since my decision to restrain (sometimes even hours past), I become aware of the fact that for some time now, the intention that was previously swarming and picking at and bothering me has gone away on its own, and I have no idea of "when" it left or anything, since it did not leave through my directly making it do so, nor did it leave informing me.

    >Almost like if a guest at a gathering at your house stayed for a bit and, upon feeling ignored and invalidated by your refusal to engage with him, left when no one was looking for fear of embarrassment. You would only realize he had gone when you noticed he was no longer there - NOT when he was visibly walking out the door. 

    Yes, that's exactly how it works. That's how the view that samādhi is concentration on an object is completely wrong: you can certainly be *anticipating* and *expecting* the moment where the mind will be "locked into" the object, whereas true abandonment of defilements is something you cannot even predict, because your imagination is *secondary* and *enclosed within* those defilments for as long as they are there (thus, anything that is possible to anticipate beforehand, including that supposed absorption "jhāna" people get, is equally enclosed within the same defilements). That's why, if you truly understand what abandonment is, you can't even crave for it. All you do is endure things here and now without any expectations, and that results in them being abandoned who knows when, no idea. Maybe in 10 minutes, maybe in 10 years (and once you truly *establish* that right endurance on the right level perfectly, the defilement is automatically gone, counterintuitively. It's just that there must no be any expectation or hope involved at all; otherwise you're still "paying attention to the guest" even in a subtle way, and he won't "leave" for that very reason).

    
    >Would this count as recollecting the "ending" of a thought, Bhante? I do not think it would make much sense to say that this recollection/awareness of the fact that the earlier intention of anger/lust is now no longer manifest - would count as - "thinking it still, which means it's still there"....?  The thought you are recollecting NOW, or the memory of the intention of lust/anger THEN, is NOW no longer underlied and backed by the same anger/lust that it was EARLIER, when you decided to restrain. Thus, when the defining characteristic (anger) of the intention of anger is no longer present when you recollect ( WITHOUT anger) the previous intention of anger no longer being there - how can that possibly constitute "still thinking" the intention of anger?

    The confusion is due to semantics. What I meant with "the thought is still there" refers specifically to when one has the view that for example, the arising of a memory of a sensual object in one's mind is a defilement, and that that must be somehow suppressed, or in general the idea that you can stop having certain specific thoughts and "see" when they ceased (which is fallacious―for as long as any thought is possible, *every* thought is possible, even remotely, and thus nothing has truly "ceased" in that misconceived way). What you are referring to as what has "ceased" with the analogy of the guest is the *intention* to act out of the thought, which can be called "a sensual thought" too as a shorthand (which is how people get confused on terminology), but it would have to be distinguished entirely from vitakkavicāra about sense objects, which is present even in the first jhāna which is utterly and perfectly purified of sensuality.

    That's why we emphasize how the practice is about *enduring* things, no matter their "content" (having been withdrawn from the degree of "content" that arises due to lack of sense restraint of course). When you do that correctly, the thoughts and memories remain the same (because they are part of "the All" just like the senses), but that deeply rooted impulse to *do* something (even very subtly by mind) when those thoughts, memories and images arise is completely gone (and *that* is the reason for the profound calm, ease, and joy of burdenlessness, ***not*** the lack of movement and thinking, which is a problem only when your mind can't help but crave to *act* out of that thinking in one way or another, the default state of a puthujjana). 

    Recognizing the citta-nimitta means seeing the "level" where that "impulse to act" is, and being able to differentiate that from thoughts and perceptions that are pressuring in their very nature (which, as [AN 6.55](https://suttacentral.net/an6.55/en/sujato?lang=en) which I often quote points out, would continue to arise even for an Arahant). Even that pressure is part of the "All"/the five aggregates, and it's one's gratuitous need and assumption that *something* must be done about it, be it indulge in it or deny it, that is the craving and defilement there.

Hello, I was listening to the HH video titled "Why did the Buddha say "Sensuality" to be an Assumption?" and at one point ([https://youtu.be/WNotZXYWV-0?si=avxKzNf3snKgh5j-&t=2895](https://youtu.be/WNotZXYWV-0?si=avxKzNf3snKgh5j-&t=2895)) Ajahn Nyanamoli mentionned that the first time he read a text about an arahant named  Anuruddha on whom a woman had tried to force her charms by getting naked, dancing and trying to sleep with him, and he stated that at first he didn't understand why it was written that an arahant became mindful of his breath, but finally came to understand that the arahant though unperturbed by the acts of the lady was aware of the significance and that it was harassing.

So I was wondering, what does "being mindful of the breath" mean in the suttas?

From what I think I understood from Ajahn Nyanamoli teachings, he doesn't think it is recommended to do breathing exercises or to force the breath and think at the same time "I"m breathing in, I'm breathing out". If I'm not mistaken he rather talks about it as something to be kept peripherally, so I don't think here "being mindful of the breath" is specifically related only to the breath, so what could be meant here? Being aware of the phenomenon arising within the 5 aggregates maybe?

    Yes, Anapanasati is not about breathing exercises or about the *perceptions* of breathing, because that has nothing to do with cultivating dispassion towards the five aggregates (the only true measure of progress). Watching one's breath and mechanical mental exercises may give rise to some insights, but those insights do not pertain to what actually disturbs the mind, meaning greed, aversion and delusion. Instead, one just hopes that going through these motions and getting these "experiences" will magically clear out the defilements, which means not only does one not know what the defilements are, but one is also not trying to find out, or is assuming them to be some trivial things that are addressed to any extent simply by sticking to this formulaic practice.

    What such practices reveal is always on the level of *perceptions*: you will hear teachers describing the "flashes of sankharas", "flow of particles" or "discontinuous stream of consciousness", or "insubstatiality/emptiness of *objects*" that one is supposed to see at the end of one's breath-observation efforts (or any similar object-centered practices not found in the Suttas). Those insights are then *inferred* to be the discernment of the Four Noble Truths through some tenuous connection, if any.

    In the best case scenario of teachers who try to be loyal to the Suttas at least superficially, you will hear them saying that craving is the problem, but they will tend to explain it in terms of a "tightening up" of your body that happens when you are not properly aware of the breath, or any more elaborate ways of saying that if you just attend to this or that *sense object* (which includes random mental phenomena gratuitously regarded to *be* insight, such as experiential perceptions of flux) your problems will be solved.

    Now onto the story you mention about Ven. Anuruddha:

    It actually doesn't say anything about him practicing anapanasati, so Ajahn Nyanamoli mixed it up with some other Sutta or simply remembered it wrongly. The actual passage in Pali only says "indriyāni okkhipitvā taṁ itthiṁ neva okolesi napi alāpi" meaning "having put down his faculties (which does not mean he cowardly "buried his head in the sand"), he neither looked at that woman nor spoke to her".

    However, the fact that AN mistakenly inserted that into the story actually goes to show what anapanasati should be about and what its actual purpose is.

    >So I was wondering, what does "being mindful of the breath" mean in the suttas?

    Not to nitpick on your question specifically, but it does in itself point towards the answer: the Suttas never talk about "being mindful ***of the breath***". That's the false premise that people often don't even realize they're starting from. This is what the Suttas say:

    >so satova assasati, satova passasati. dīghaṃ vā assasanto ‘dīghaṃ assasāmī’ti ***pajānāti***, dīghaṃ vā passasanto ‘dīghaṃ passasāmī’ti ***pajānāti***...

    >Remembering, he breathes in; remembering, he breathes out. Or, breathing in long, he ***understands*** "I am breathing in long", or, breathing out long, he ***understands*** "I am breathing out long"..

    —MN 118

    (pajānāti is the verb form of paññā, understanding/discernment)

    To most this will sound like a distinction without a difference, but it's absolutely crucial. If the Buddha wanted to convey the idea that the breath as an __object__ is what the practice revolves around, he would have said something more like "dīghaṁ assāsaṁ __paṭisaṁvedeti/manasi karoti__", meaning "he experiences/attends to __an inhalation__." or something along those lines which points to some benefit in observing perceptions and sensations per se instead of *understanding*.

    What the Buddha is saying here is that one must understand the act of "[I am] breathing in long", and "understanding", even in mundane terms, is not about the object or perception that you attend to directly. It's always about knowing the *nature* of that thing in an indirect manner (really, reflect on that for a moment). If you're a mechanic, your understanding of cars is not determined by some specific *object*, but by having a whole bunch of meanings and peripheral significances that your mind naturally remembers and serve as an implicit background to whenever you look at a car.

    In this case, that "peripheral" understanding of the body and its breathing (kayasankhara) automatically brings dispassion towards anything that pertains to that body, most especially the six sense base. It has nothing to do with stopping or suppressing the six sense base in favor of breathing sensations.

    
    True anapanasati leads one first and foremost to overcome the default identification with the pull of the six senses, so that no matter how hard they pull towards this or that, the mind [remains established and anchored](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.247/en/bodhi) in the *simultaneous foundation* for that sense domain in its entirety. The entire world of pleasing and displeasing sense objects exists "on top of" the breathing body, hence Ajahn Nyanamoli wrote that one must be recognizing the breath "underneath" one's experience in the "How to Calm Your Mind" Chapter in Dhamma Within Reach.

    
    So, when the situation with that woman happened to Ven. Anuruddha, the mind would be able to "withdraw the faculties" not by becoming oblivious to what is happening and shutting it out forcefully (already rooted in the wrong view that you are the master of your experiences and feelings), but by becoming anchored in that peripheral recognition of what determines his senses (because even if he were to close his eyes and cover his ears, that wouldn't make a difference; the six wild animals already know exactly what's going on), and that would make him dispassionate towards the entire thing, not feeling any sort of internal agitation while the full force of that significance of offered pleasure is still there, attacking *the same body that is also breathing and is being discerned through that.*

    Thus, what anapanasati―if it is to be a "Buddhist" practice in the first place like everything else found in the Suttas―has to lead to is this:

    >“Bhante, when a bhikkhu is thus perfectly liberated in mind, even if powerful forms cognizable by the eye come into range of the eye, they do not obsess his mind; his mind is not at all affected. It remains steady, attained to imperturbability, and he recognizes their liabaility to decay. Even if powerful sounds cognizable by the ear come into range of the ear … Even if powerful odors cognizable by the nose come into range of the nose … Even if powerful tastes cognizable by the tongue come into range of the tongue … Even if powerful tactile objects cognizable by the body come into range of the body … Even if powerful phenomena cognizable by the mind come into range of the mind, they do not obsess his mind; his mind is not at all affected. It remains steady, attained to imperturbability, and he recognizes their liability to decay.

    ―AN 6.55

    And ***not***:

    >"Bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu is thus perfectly concentrated on the breath, there are no forms cognizable by the eye. The sensations of breathing and bodily pleasure are what obsess his mind, so there is no chance for anything else to arise and disturb him."

    The former is unshakable samādhi, the latter is pleasant oblivion and ***loss*** of awareness (AKA "absorption").

    Last but certainly not least, it must be noted that anapanasati, as any other form of Right Recollection, requires the Right View to be done properly (APS is called "the abiding of a Noble One" in SN 54.11 and taught to an ariya-only Sangha in MN 118) and most certainly it requires not *acting* out of the pulls of the six senses towards sensuality and ill-will, which will inherently mean that you will not be able to recognize that which is "underneath" them. Every time you act unskilfully with the body you are already overlooking its sankhara by a longshot, and are involved with the sankharas of desires, which are way coarser.

    Edit: By *learning* what Anapanasati truly is, one is learning what the Right View is by extension, and it is only from that lens that one should approach it. Not as something that one is *already* practicing rightly.

### How to live virtue according to the Dhamma

Could you recommend a text, book, or transcript by HH that provides a more detailed and practice-oriented explanation of the first step of gradual training, virtues, sense restriction, and endurance? 

Could it be useful to read the Vinaya?

    >provides a more detailed and practice-oriented explanation of the first step of gradual training, virtues, sense restriction, and endurance? 

    >Could it be useful to read the Vinaya? 

    If my sense of what you're asking is correct (especially with your mention of the Vinaya), you will not find "detailed" explanations of the practice of virtue in HH teachings.

    That's because that's exactly what one needs to avoid in order to truly become "accomplished in virtue". If your virtue and restraint depends on adhering to any more specific instructions than that of not breaking the 8 precepts, it will still be a form of adhering to virtue and duty.

    The "accomplishment in virtue" that the Suttas refer to as a prerequisite for samādhi and as that which characterizes the stream-enterer is *defined* by the fact that one has learned what is wholesome and what is unwholesome on the basis of one's mental state, not on the basis of specific guidelines. Even the Vinaya is its current legalistic and highly detailed form is actually not supposed to exist ideally. It exists only because monks over time started losing perspective, and people of increasingly lowly character began to join the Sangha. In the beginning, "don't do anything unwholesome" would've been enough for monks to keep perfect virtue, because they had the criteria of their mental state as the determining factor which, without even thinking about it, made them incapable of breaking the still-unexistent rules that were actually addressing unwholesome actions and not just cultural expectations and circumstances.

    So, if you're still keeping the 5 precepts only then the more "detailed" practice would be to work towards keeping the 8, gradually if you must. As part of that effort, you would also need to work on abandoning doubt on a mental level, the other of the first 3 fetters, that will often arise when your mind feels that the precepts are somehow "not enough" and wants to over-clarify what unwholesome is, in the way the Vinaya does in its commentary (which did not come from the Buddha) under each rule.

    The whole point of that "noble aggregate of virtue" that a sotāpanna has is that they're not *doing it*. They need absolutely no "details" anymore in order to keep their virtue unbroken, not because they memorized the entire Vinaya and commentaries and sub-commentaries, but because they thoroughly discerned what is the criterion for wholesome and unwholesome *internally*. And that is something that will stay with you even after you die, whereas the intellectual "details" that you learned will be gone even in this life if you get some neurological disease, meaning the core of your practice of "virtue" would go with it (which is the case for many monks, unfortunately).

    [This](https://www.hillsidehermitage.org/intentions-behind-ones-actions/) is the practice of virtue in its entirety.

    While that is being brought to fulfillment, simply never break the 8 precepts. They are obvious enough. Not killing does not mean never eating meat or devoting your practice time to saving lives, for example. It means not killing.

    The first thing to point out is that, if the definition you suggest for "an animal being killed for you" were correct, the Buddha should have never eaten meat. If anything, given the much smaller size of ancient India society, and based on the sheer number of monks that there seem to have been according to many suttas, monks accepting meat back then were contributing by a much larger margin to the local meat industry than today. I'm not totally sure if that was from a sutta, but I remember someone mentioning that back then there were days where no animals were slaughtered because there was no demand for meat on that day, and that was mainly possible because of course there was no way to store meat for very long unlike now. That just goes to show how much every individual was *actually* contributing to the slaughters.

    That means that by simply allowing the Sangha to consume meat, the Buddha was intentionally choosing not to decrease the demand for meat, and was *(in your definition)* responsible for the slaughter of many thousands of animals during his lifetime that perhaps *actually* wouldn't have died if he had prohibited meat for monks, not to mention Buddhists in general, given that even 5 precept laypeople―which by the time the Buddha died probably made up a sizeable chunk of many parts of India―are expected to keep the precept of not killing just as strictly. 

    And that's just in his lifetime, without thinking about the consequences of his decision as the founder of a major world religion that was to last over 2500 years and counting. On top of that, he was more than once prompted to make vegetarianism mandatory (e.g. the incident with Devadatta), and not only did he not take the chance to make it a part of his teachings (say if it hypothetically "slipped his mind" initially because he was only thinking about the internal aspects of practice)―he outright *refused* to prohibit meat in the face of such requests.

    The natural conclusion from this is that what the Buddha meant with not accepting meat that you suspect has been killed for you is not what Buddhist vegans think he meant, in which case not only would've he been breaking the rule all the time, but also there would basically be no way to eat meat blamelessly unless you stole it from somebody else who bought it or ate exclusively roadkill.

    On to the more internal aspect of why eating meat or not is not relevant to the overcoming of suffering, greed, aversion and delusion, [nor even to the development of the 4 brahmaviharas](https://suttacentral.net/mn55/en/sujato):

    Today more than ever, people need to learn to make the essential distinction between *ethics/morality* and *virtue* in the way the Buddha taught it (the rendering of sīla as "morality";"ethics" in some translations of the suttas is disastrous). Ethics and morality are a fuzzy, mediocre approximation of virtue, and in a lot of situations the ethical thing to do goes *against* sīla (understood specifically as the first of the three trainings that lead out of craving and suffering). A good example of this is how it would be generally regarded as unethical to refuse to kill one person who will kill a million people, or to refuse to tell a lie to save someone from severe pain or death, which from the lens of purity of sīla are *unequivocally* the right things to do.

    The definition of sīla in the Buddha's teaching is the abstinence from actions that are rooted in an internal resistance to emotional discomfort in any shape or form, and both of the actions I just mentioned would originate from just that, despite the fact that the whole world would regard them as ethically and morally justifiable―even *necessary*. 

    In the case of veganism, despite one's *stated* and internally visible intentions towards non-greed and compassion, it is usually rooted in craving against displeasure, in this instance that of knowing that animals are dying in order to produce meat (which seems to be at least partly where you're coming from too).

    And, not by coincidence, the defining characteristic of the undeveloped mind is its inability to be aware of what it actually intends (in terms of craving and non-craving), and thus as corollary, its tendency to recognize only superficial, rationally pleasing ideas―all secondary to the craving that remains unseen―as "my intention behind this", and taking *that* to be wholesome (thus it's said in the suttas that only a sotapanna and above truly knows kusala as kusala).

    A person who is free from resistance towards displeasure is incapable of being emotionally moved by [anything in the whole world](https://suttacentral.net/an6.55/en/sujato), and that includes the fact that animals get slaughtered to produce meat, because fundamentally that bother is a reaction of *your senses*―that's why you need to *look* at the slaughter videos to really get the motivation for veganism going―which an Arahant has fully understood as unownable and perilous to be domineered by. 

    It's also paramount to distinguish, just like with virtue vs. ethics, *empathy* vs. *compassion*. The former is about implicitly regarding certain types of suffering as "good" and taking them willingly onto oneself (namely that of oppressed groups), while the latter refuses to recognize any form of suffering in *one's own mind* as justifiable. Only when standing upon the latter does truly helping others without compromising one's own welfare becomes possible, although that severely limits in what ways and scenarios one is able to help (see below). Empathy is about *feeling more*, while true compassion takes you in the direction of being imperturbable by feelings, be it yours or others' (which is why it's skilful and contributes to Nibbāna―no other reason).

    A person who is *empathetic* is "scratching an itch", as we say (acting out of craving), by going out of their way to save beings from dying, and they would suffer if they cannot do so, while a person who is compassionate would also try to prevent deaths whenever they can but without feeling any sort of discomfort or remorse if they don't for whatever reason (bearing in mind here as well that their individual choice and of everyone they have influence over will not put the slightest dent in the demand for meat).

    So, the first thing a person should learn to do is stop resisting discomfort, *no matter where it comes from*, and abandon the view that certain types of suffering/craving are wholesome, which all too many people today have. Then, once one has fully seen the way out of craving against pain and one has become at least a sotāpanna, one will know what true compassion is, and one will be free to choose to eat or not to eat meat that is bought from a market, because one will see that that's has nothing to do with cruelty or non-cruelty. On the contrary, the seeds of cruelty lie latent within you, although they may not have sprouted yet, for as long as you crave against discomfort of *any kind* (evidenced perfectly by how some vegans are terribly hostile towards meat-eaters, and would even say they deserve to be slaughtered like the animals). Craving to prevent the external misfortunes of animals or any group  *automatically* means not caring as much about the misfortunes of all others, at least by a tiny bit, which means one's mind is fundamentally limited and bounded. 

    Hence the Suttas say that the brahmavihāras need to be applied in "every direction". That doesn't mean you go through some mechanical process of visualizing individual groups or people as is the standard and misguided way, but that your attitude, if it's right, applies *all at once* to the entire world without any bias. From that perspective, you would be incapable of feeling any less compassion for the people who will lose their jobs and the thousands of companies and family businesses that will go broke if the meat industry collapses.

    And it's precisely because a person who has that true, boundless compassion is fundamentally "locked in" from every direction too, so to speak―in the sense that they cannot possibly become involved and biased towards one faction in a conflict or dispute because they have equal compassion for all―that they are not only wary of but also *incapable* of "activism" and of trying to change the world, which necessarily involves taking things from some to give them to others, in the broadest sense. That's why you didn't see the Buddha using all his wisdom and influence to change society.

    
    I will also point out, going back to the topic of morality/ethics vs. sīla, that being concerned with the former at the cost of the latter prevents one from grasping the signs of one's mind, as that involves leaning even more into the view of regarding external relations and facts to be the determining factors for kusala and akusala and not one's attitude towards the present feeling, thus also reinforcing the attachment to virtue and practices. *That's* why he rejected compulsory abstinence from meat without hesitation.

    Lastly, veganism and a lot of what is considered "ethics", involving trying to influence the world but without violating the five precepts (in which case it's *both* unskilful and demeritorious), can be said to be meritorious actions, whereas the virtue of one who strives for liberation is for the most part neither meritorous nor demeritorous (referred to as "imperturbable" in SN 12.51). Meritorious (puñña) actions that compromise non-craving are *unskilful* (akusala) when it comes to the Path.

    
    Have a look at [this](https://suttacentral.net/ud6.9/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin), an interesting example of the Buddha not immediately rushing to prevent every single being from dying that he could. One should err on the side of caution more often than not, especially in the beginning, but it goes to show that what people think of as perfect compassion is not a Buddh-ist idea.

    Sure, I'll shamelessly admit that I read a lot of things into what you wrote (although most of it was just general points that I expected to indirectly make you recognize where you were going wrong). I do that every single time I write anything, since I can't afford to dig into everyone's precise beliefs in order to write something constructive, and it should generally not be necessary unless my educated guess happens to be wrong. I'm willing to take your word for it that it was in this case, although that wouldn't change the main point at all.

    
    >I am not saying that it not permissible to eat meat under any circumstances and it does not follow from my logic that the Buddha increased demand by not banning meat. I never suggested banning meat. 

    My point was that by not  prohibiting monks from accepting meat altogether even when asked to do so probably more than once, the Buddha was implicitly OK with the fact that lay followers would be buying that meat from *somewhere* if they were not killing the animals themselves (and furthermore, because I guess back then you paid the butcher directly, it would've been even worse than what happens today when someone buys meat; if anything could be regarded an indirect breach of the precept by your logic, it would be that).

    
    >If a monk receives a gift that happens to be meat that is fine, if a person buys a product from a store that happens to have an animal product in it its fine. 

    If with "happens to have an animal product in it" you don't include meat,  you would still contradict how the Buddha did not ban the purchase of meat for all Buddhists. If he intended something as radical as what you argue, "only when the animal was not killed for your sake or suspected to have been so" would've been an extremely roundabout and inefficient way of saying "don't eat meat unless it was offered to you randomly", which is what I presume you think he meant.

    >What is the difference between asking someone to kill an animal for you to eat, which you obviously can't do if you have done the requisite internal work and that HH doesn't do and asking someone to kill an animal so you can eat their eggs? which HH does, even though the rule about suspicion is very clear and you never disputed it.

    Buying animal products, let alone asking someone else to buy them, does not constitute "asking someone to kill an animal" (as per [Pācittiya 39](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc39/en/brahmali?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin), a monk is outright *allowed* to request meat if he's ill and requires it or if it's not for himself, or if it's "from those who have invited him to ask"; note also that it's unlikely the list of suggestions in the Samanadipa website was written by monks, since one generally doesn't feel comfortable interfering with such matters. Not to say that there's anything inherently wrong with the list though).

    What it all boils down is the fact that the animals that are dying to produce those products would still have died no matter who buys them unless changes in society or even on a local scale took place that monks and monasteries who are actually focusing on seclusion and practice have no hope of effecting. The amount of eggs or meat that would or would not be purchased for a small monastery makes no difference.

    >To me what constitutes a reasonable suspicion that the animal was slaughtered for you is if you give someone money or ask someone to give someone else money for specifically an animal product and that person says openly they will use that money to kill more animals, we have been using this money to kill animals, it is what we are all about, then that constitutes a reasonable suspicion. 

    So, suggesting animal products as a donation is absolutely not the same as directly giving money to butchers (which, again, is probably much closer to what the laypeople back in the Buddha's day were doing and he doesn't seem to have had a problem with that). The money nowadays is being given by the lay supporters to the supermarket or whichever intermediary, and those intermediaries would continue to pay the animal farms exactly the same amount regardless of whether the *entire* tiny fraction of fortunate and well-off monasteries spread all over the world―that have even a remote possibility of adhering to a healthy vegan lifestye―were to refrain from encouraging animal products as offerings.

    The fact that Samanadipa lists eggs and not meat actually goes to show that at least they're trying to be as scrupulous as is feasible. I think we would all agree that at least *in theory* that action on their part contributes (although in reality it doesn't at all) to less total deaths, or at least not as many in the same span of time, as asking for poultry. I doubt that the amount of eggs they end up receiving on account of that mention is even sufficient to meet nutritional needs of animal protein, so they're actually willing to be somewhat deficient for the sake of extra scrupulosity and not asking too much. You can't eat more than a few eggs when you have only one meal a day anyway.

    >A separate point that seems similarly obvious to me is what constitutes a legitimate reason to need meat, if you need to eat meat to meet your micro-nutrient, macro-nutrient or caloric requirements and there is no viable plant-based way to do that, then its fine. I hope that atleast would be uncontroversial.

    This allowance would be arbitrary and would constitute heedlessness based on how the Buddha said virtue should be practiced (if the points you make were truly relevant to the precept on not killing):

    >Just as the great ocean is stable and does not overflow its boundaries, so too, when I have prescribed a training rule for my disciples, they will not transgress it even for life’s sake. This is the second astounding and amazing quality that the bhikkhus see in this Dhamma and discipline….

    ―AN 8.19

    If your arguments were valid, a true monk would be __compelled__ to not only not ask for meat, but to actively discourage all Buddhists from offering meat at all so as to not allow even a chance for being "complicit" (in your definition) in the killing of animals, even if it means death or illness. Death should be preferrable to commiting one of the 5 actions an Arahant can never do for one who is intent on liberation, and one who is willing to do those for the sake of their life, let alone their health, should not hope to reach it until they get their act together.

    Nevertheless, to use this admission you yourself made for the sake of argument: it's easy for a relatively well-off (and particularly Western) individual layperson to ensure they get access to all the supplements and workarounds that are needed in order to lead a healthy vegan lifestyle. But providing that for *all* the monks in *one* monastery, let alone all of them, considering that the well-supported places are actually quite few, would be a pipe dream. 

    A Vinaya rule requires a layperson to have offered themselves *explicitly* to provide what monks may need for requesting things to be allowable. It is rare for such people to actually keep up with and renew those invitations for the monks to feel comfortable to, say, call the responsible lay supporter to tell them the place ran out of tofu or vitamins *specifically*, and *on top of that* dissuade them from bringing meat (in your definition, assenting to unpurchased meat being purchased in this case would mean being complicit in killing, and thus one would be *forced* to ask the layperson to spend more when it's not strictly necessary, a blameworthy act for a monk). In fact, even putting expensive and unconventional things like supplements and vegan protein on a list of *suggested* offerings even if it's not outright demanded would be considered reprehensible on the part of monks. 

    On top of all this, this would apply to the best case scenario in a Western country, but in Asia people would certainly not be able to support the monks with healthy vegan diet. A monastery needs funds for a lot of other things like electricity bills, maintenance of buildings, other consumable items monks use, salaries for workers, etc., so they would have to divert funds and support away from that in order to get by well without animal products.

    I will mention now in passing, which I couldn't in the first comment due to being limited to 10000 characters, that I have no horse in this race. I have barely consumed meat or eggs in the years since I went forth, as in Sri Lanka usually all monks get is milk (powdered to boot, meaning less nutrients, and even that is a luxury for many). I don't enjoy it, nor animal products in general, as I have a sensitive gut. Thus, my only interest here has been to refute a *view* that is an obstacle to becoming accomplished in virtue, seeing the signs of one's mind, and knowing wholesome as wholesome and unwholesome as unwholesome. If I argue against veganism, it would only be because, more often than not, *insisting upon it* is rooted in that wrong view that completely misses the true threshold of unwholesome and projects it in the external world. Not because I care about what I eat.

    Finally, I will point out (in a friendly manner and not to provoke you) that your visible upset here is evidence of my overall point that abstaining from meat beyond the specific cases where it's not allowable (which I am showing are much less numerous than you seem to think) does not in the end bring unwholesome states to decrease, but often the opposite when it's paired with a fixed view. As I said, the purpose of the practice is to be emotionally undisturbed in every situation, not to be disturbed "for the right reasons". If one is not willing to accept that as the goal then that's fine, but it cannot be then called the Buddha's teaching (and again, I am not "aiming" this at you, but just expressing a principle).

    >You have absolutely no concept of the practicalities of vegan nutrition. 
     
    I can also say that it seems you don't have much familiarity with how monasteries work. The fact is you will receive meat and animal products unless you openly announce that it's discouraged (and either way you will certainly not receive enough vegan protein unless you very strongly announce the need in a manner unbecoming of renunciates), and the decision to allow gifts of meat that were given randomly without your influence would be entirely arbitrary and unjustifiable if purchasing parts of already dead animals and having others do so for you were a breach of precepts. As I said, you would be compelled to do something monks should not do to stay clean, which is *make demands* to supporters, in this case not to offer meat at all. You would be complacent with your (in this definition) virtue otherwise, exploiting a loophole. (Knowing the average monk, he would also find a way to get around this if it were the actual rule, so that the chance of the receiving meat he craves for can be increased without even indirectly asking for it at all).

    Even if we put that aside, the point still stands that *even* if you were to openly ask for meat, which back in the day would've likely entailed a layperson going and paying a butcherer directly as I said, there would be no breach of virtue. That is the Buddha's own standpoint, as he himself made that rule in Pācittiya 39 I mentioned in the previous reply for *monks*, who must keep their virtue pure as a crystal even in the face of death and illness, not for laypeople who generally are not expected to be as strict.

    If the layperson's paying that butcher would've resulted in an animal being killed that wouldn't have died at that moment, say if he killed it after the customer arrived, that would constitute grounds for that meat to be rejected. The fact that the animal would've died anyway is actually ***not*** an excuse in this case; same reason why euthanasia is not allowed. Even if the death will definitely come about eventually, *you* should never be the one responsible for precipitating it. It means that your *intention* was involved in that death—an *option* to act in your mind that you could've rejected and chose to act upon it regardless—and intention is what action is, as the Buddha said. Nothing beyond that is relevant to virtue, only to ethics (not to say the latter is bad, but when it's mixed up with the former, the Dhamma is obscured).

    Unless one sees it on this level, one will always be able to doubt and "increase" one's purity more because it will always be *external* (taking the same principle to the extreme, Jains got into all their excessive and ridiculous rituals and abstinences in the name of "virtue"). Perfection (Arahantship) is impossible for as long as one operates on that external level. The idea that veganism is inherently more virtuous is a—much less radical than the Jains but still similar in principle—form of seeking that same external purity, which is why the Buddha refused to make it compulsory along with [Devadattas other suggestions](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10/en/brahmali?lang=en&layout=linebyline&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin) like living under the root of a tree and eating only alms round. Making any of that compulsory would entail encouraging attachment to rites and rituals, thus obstructing the way to sotāpatti.

    In fact, all the other things he suggested the Buddha to enforce were things he and the chief disciples [repeatedly spoke praise of](https://suttacentral.net/thag20.1/en/sujato?lang=en), whereas you don't find praise for the avoidance of meat anywhere. (On the contrary, all you find on the topic is Suttas that *debunk* the idea of it being necessary, like MN 55 and Snp 2.2.)

    That's because these other external habits like eating only alms food and living in the forest *do* least contribute to effacement and non-craving in those who know how to implement them (which is not everyone and hence they cannot be generalized), whereas avoiding the meat of animals that weren't killed for you does nothing inherently (unless you like meat a lot, in which case it would still not necessarily be right because it'd be likely rooted in the wrong view that things being agreeable to your tongue is what craving is).

### The arahant and his baby

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

During minute 7:35 Ajahn Nyanamoli talked about a sutta where a mother bring her baby to her ex husband who's an arahant. He said the arahant didn't even look at the baby until the mother realized "He would leave this baby to die" and take the baby home.

&#x200B;

I wanna know which sutta this is. And also I'm wondering, Ajahn talk about how the Buddha said "it's how every arahant should behave" but isn't it neglecting the baby? What if the mother didn't come back? The baby would really die.

&#x200B;

What is the difference in taking care of a baby and dogs?

&#x200B;

    >And also I'm wondering, Ajahn talk about how the Buddha said "it's how every arahant should behave" 

    Yes, he uttered a verse in praised of that monk.

    >but isn't it neglecting the baby? What if the mother didn't come back? The baby would really die.

    He probably knew that she was going to come back, but either way he wouldn't have been emotionally bound to the baby.

    It's not that he would have been *unaware* of the significance and the feelings of "this is my son", and register only "bare perceptions" of a lump of flesh like a robot, but that his mind would always instinctively recognize that as a [lovely but poisonous drink](https://suttacentral.net/SN12.66/en/sujato). Thus, it would be impossible for him to even *mentally* act out of that arisen significance in the [murderous five aggregates](https://suttacentral.net/sn22.85/en/sujato) and "love" the baby, due to always fully [withstanding and remaining unmoved by the force](https://suttacentral.net/SN35.228/en/sujato) of any significance that comes up. By extension, it would be even more impossible for him to act out of it bodily or verbally and start playing with the baby and so on, happily chugging down that tasty venom and letting the 5 amicable murderers inside his home.

    But, in the unlikely event that the mother didn't come back, and if the significance of "he will die" became strong enough, which it wasn't at that moment, he would go through the hassle of doing something to prevent it from dying, and finding someone else who can take care of the child as soon as possible, without ever swallowing the poisonous drink being offered to him internally at any point.

    
    >What is the difference in taking care of a baby and dogs?

    Dogs can't talk. That's a huge one.

    They also don't need to be raised, and your behavior has only a limited influence on their internal development. They won't start doing drugs or killing people if you neglect them. They are  easy to feed and can pretty much take care of themselves for the most part, and don't need an education. You can even neuter them and make them even easier to take care of while also greatly diminishing their suffering.

    Besides, they die pretty soon, so you have to be foolish and shortsighted to allow yourself to become attached to them too much.

    In comparison, the hassle of raising a child is so large that it *requires* the perversion of perception of suffering as happiness in order to willingly take it on.

    Also, as a human, if you have a person who is asleep with you, your mind will not feel truly alone. But you can be with a dozen dogs and you would still be able to feel internally secluded if you're not attached to them. That's just how the aggregates work.

    But of course, if you become attached to the dogs, or to anything, then you're still ingesting poison that tastes good, and will pay the price eventually.

    Edit: And, the point of the video is that mettā is not "loving kindness". True mettā would be the fact that he would prevent the baby from dying if the mother truly never came back, without "loving" it at all, and that mettā would apply to that baby exactly to the same extent as any other being, without a bias.

    In contrast, the modern idea of mettā as "loving kindness" has you picture a person who is skilled in it *loving a baby that's not even theirs*, and even expanding that attitude towards all beings. As in, going out of your way to ingest the noxious cocktails of others.

    The problem is evidenced by how they would be horrified if the being they're spreading "loving kindness" towards were to be killed next moment, and *get angry* at whoever did it, proving that there's a bias. But if it's true mettā, whether it's towards humans or animals, you wouldn't be disturbed and angry with anyone if that happened. Hence, it's a form of complete non-attachment that actually brings you closer to Arahantship instead of away from it.

    >Would people who have kids and then go on to be a monk gets bad kamma? I know Buddha did it but he was a prince so his wife and kids would be taken care of in his absence but what about normal people?

    It's not about "getting" bad kamma; that's a wrong notion people have today. It's about *doing* bad kamma (kamma literally means "action").

    Any action that is rooted in greed, aversion and delusion on the level of your mental state doesn't "give you" bad kamma, it __is__ bad kamma. It might sound like a mere semantic difference, but if you think about it, you'll see that it changes your attitude and sense of responsibility completely, and only then do you get to understand the famous "beings are owners of their actions, heirs of their actions...", etc.

    So yes, whether it's abandoning your children or staying with them, you are performing bad kamma if there are unwholesome intentions behind it.

    That being said, it is very unlikely that you would be able to abandon your children knowing they might die and there's no one to care for them *without* unwholesome intentions. 

    If the other parent is technically able to carry the burden but doesn't *want to*, then if you have a profound sense of urgency you should be at least willing to leave it all behind and never look back, like the monk in this Sutta obviously had done. That action will be rooted in craving on your end initially, but if you have a clear context about what the practice is, and recognize that ordination is not for the sake of running away and *forgetting* about your problems but about *facing them* relentlessly on the internal level, then it could be more beneficial than the other, *also-rooted-in-craving* option of continuing lay life.

    If your sense of urgency and zeal for the practice is not that strong or if ordination simply is not in the cards then the best thing would be to move out, take on the eight precepts and refuse to provide anything other than financial support, and there is even a possibility that your spouse may find someone else soon enough.

    Also, you don't get asked at the ordination whether you have a wife and kids, but you do get asked whether you're in debt or serve the army. So if you're from a Western country where there are child support laws, you are technically in debt if you leave your children, and thus wouldn't be a suitable candidate for ordination.

    Thus, better to never have neither kids nor a partner in the first place if freedom from suffering is truly the priority.

### Where to Visit/Ordain

This question has been asked before but with the growth of this community, I think it may be worth asking again, especially with the addition of Bhante u/Bhikkhu_Anigha

I believe an appropriate monastic environment would have the following:

1) Plenty of time for seclusion/study/contemplation and away from the city
2) Strong adherence to and training in the vinaya
3) Meditation instruction that is either absent, optional, open-ended, or not strict
4) (for foreigners) A visa situation that is not overly burdensome
5) (optional) Internet access

I am interested in monasteries that fulfil the above criteria. I am curious if there is a decent way to vet monasteries for these qualities (esp 1-3) relatively quickly. Maybe some general qualities to look out for. For example, I have heard Dhammayut monasteries are generally strict about vinaya.

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/17y7q8o/where_to_visitordain/k9tuuot/)** _2023-11-19 00:22:24:

    I'll give advice from the perspective of someone who's only lived in Sri Lanka so far:

    Here you should be able to find places that meet at least the first 4 criteria (not sure what you meant with the 5th. They usually wouldn't confiscate your phone unlike Thai places, if that's what you're referring to, unless it's a "Meditation Center"; more on that below).

    

    The visa situation is generally better than in Thailand, since it is at least possible to get more than a one year visa in special cases if you're already a monk.

    There's also not much of a strong emphasis on "teachers", and they tend to be a lot more relaxed than in Thailand, as far as I've heard about how it is there. That applies even more for foreigners, who would hardly ever be "forced" to do things, and would generally be able to avoid most of the unnecessary duties and distractions the local monks happily engage in (which is still less than in Thailand; I've seen monks there meticulously polishing *floors* with handkerchiefs, let alone the large Buddha statues. That former would never happen here; the latter only every once in a while at most). And there's only a few monasteries, usually more in the "Meditation Center" style, that have teachers of the "Guru" type, in the sense of an infallible spiritual leader. I ordained in one of those places and they confiscated my phone/SIM Card (though I got it back eventually) and even there it was possible to not participate in most of the unnecessary fluff like group meditation without repercussion long enough to get my higher ordination, after which pressure to conform started to increase.

    I don't think you would even be getting "Meditation Instructions" in the majority of places here, or at least they wouldn't be enforced, more so as a foreigner.

    For strict Vinaya you would have to look here for the "Galduwa" forest monasteries, the sect that is roughly equivalent to the Dhammayut (and in some areas not so similar, which can be good). "We" keep strict Vinaya―monks who use money are for instance not allowed in the Patimokkha―although it's mostly based on the Commentaries and can sometimes be pedantic and clearly made up. But it's not too bad and a downright heretic like myself has been able to go along just fine, not trying to defend "the right way" of Vinaya free of Commentarial influences that would equally be just as much of a rite/ritual, and even more so because then you're *going out of your way* to make sure it's followed.

    [This pdf](https://www.bps.lk/olib/mi/mi008.pdf) was useful when I was starting out, although there's probably a lot of outdated information. By the time I got here it was already not entirely accurate, not to mention now.

    Yes, I ordained in Na Uyana. What Ajahn Nyanamoli might have said about it would've originated from my own reports, I assume.

    I would now not advise anyone to ordain there, although the place goes up and down in terms of strictness, so it's possible that now it's better than that exodus period back when I left. But they certainly want to turn it into an international Pa Auk meditation center, so they won't rest until that goal is achieved, gradually if it must. Before I arrived right at the start of Covid, it was much more relaxed and it was the most popular place for foreigners, and it was based on those reports including from friends of his that AN suggested me to go there. Once I got there it was OK but was already tightening up. By now there's hardly any Western foreigners left AFAIK.

    Na Uyana is the only place here that ticks all the boxes of "international; large; Pa Auk 'meditation'; ordination-centric; strict Vinaya", so it's pretty much unique, and like I said most monasteries don't have a meditation program. The only advantage of going there now would be the easy visas, but I wouldn't be surprised if they've become more careful now to ensure they only give long extensions to people who are religiously following the teaching there, knowing how many people deliberately took advantage and left.

    > If I understand the principle correctly, it's that a _genuine, perpetual_ dependence on the laity is what will produce enough pressure to motivate consistent samadhi. . However, I must admit, my opinion is moreso that it's the distractions of lay life (work, family) that prevent one from long-term practice of jhana, this being the main determinant of whether one destroys the three defilements. 

    The point I made was not about samādhi, and money per se is not an obstruction to jhāna (unless it's being acquired  with sensual intentions, and ***that*** would be the obstruction internally). There were anāgāmis in the Suttas who still used money and were the head of a household, like Citta the Householder. What I wrote was more about Arahantship and complete relinquishment, hence I mentioned that access to wealth is why laypeople cannot become Arahants, defining "layperson" as one who doesn't keep the 10th precept.

    Nevertheless, that *does not mean* that one is "justified" or spared from the consequences of __not__ keeping the 10th precept if one is a layperson. Fundamentally, every bit of non-renunciation that you engage in is adding more fog and obstacles to the path towards liberation whether you wear a robe or jeans, and the failure to accept responsibility and the weight of remorse of  such compromises, *insisting* in finding reasons why it's "fine" and one shouldn't feel the burden of that responsibility, is actually the primary way in which those choices would become an obstacle, because now the ***internal value*** of non-renunciation is being cultivated, and the honest recognition of akusala as akusala is being shoved under the rug.

    So the fact that other monks use money would be even less justification for one to do so if one is truly taking on the robe so as to destroy all possible external compromises that are making even the Right View more difficult, even if the 10th precept does not become absolutely indispensable until later on. It would defeat the purpose, and you would be subjecting yourself to all the downsides of ordination without getting the main benefit. You would only do that if you believe that the robe magically gives you spiritual powers or something that don't depend on your rigorous, no-matter-if-I-die adherence to the rules.

    
    >“Just as the great ocean is stable and does not overflow its boundaries, so too, when I have prescribed a training rule for my disciples, they will not transgress it even for life’s sake. This is the second astounding and amazing quality that the bhikkhus see in this Dhamma and discipline….

    ―AN 8.19 

    (We could make a case that this does not apply to most of the 227 rules since many of them may not have even existed when the Buddha said this, but the 10th precept was always part of the "training rules").

    Also, I did forget to mention the thing about staying a novice, which is certainly an option that would prevent most of the hassle involved in the ordination process.

    Although one should also be careful to be honest with honeself about *why* one is not taking higher ordination. If it's because there is genuinely no place suitable for practice that will ordain you without the expectation that you will stay with them for the entire nissaya period, then that's a good reason to stay a novice and prioritize your practice and suitable environment instead. (Though I can't say that scenario sounds likely, not sure about Thailand but in Sri Lanka I don't think so).

    If you stay a novice because deep down you still want to have the freedom to do whatever you want within limits, that's another compromise you would be making, and it would become another form of "finding safety". Again, not that it would be a total deal-breaker, but if you already went  that far, you might as well make yourself fully incapable of ensuring that you will stay alive (relinquishing the ability to cook and store food), and also make yourself unable to do certain things and just hide them (such as masturbating). You are forced to confess, go on a probation period, and then be admonished in front of the sangha before your status is reinstated if you do that. And of course, at least *some* of the other lighter offenses do involve things that are actually unwholesome and not just cultural.

    Technically the practice is always on you, but the thing is that external "barrier" actually adds more pressure into the mix and raises the stakes, it doesn't make it easier (assuming you have basic self-transparency and responsibility of course, which unfortunately can't be said for many who ordain). The way that the interdependence of bhikkhus for things like confession was organized by the Buddha makes it so that it should put a hole on your sense of safety more than it should reinforce it (although the way communities are structured today, centered on a lopsided idea of "harmony" involving metaphorical group-hugs makes it be the other way around, usually).

    Edit: So what I would do is find a place that gives novice ordination reasonably easily (which should be most ezcept the Ajahn Chah ones) and then at least eventually start looking for a place that can make me a bhikkhu without too much inconvenience and a 5-year contract. There are downsides to it obviously, but for one who knows how to take advantage of it, it should be a net win. And of course the code of discipline is designed so that it falls squarely within the Middle Way, despite how it may nowadays be misused for overzealous denial and scrupulosity, or for the justification of monk-ly indulgence.

    Right, doesn't sound surprising as far as the things I've heard about Thailand. That's why I've never even considered going there, although I imagine for someone who is already past their nissaya period or someone who is staying a samanera there may be some suitable places to stay.

    Edit: I also forgot to mention some of the reasons why I don't like the Thai tradition: the whole intoxication with "the form" and the overall ideal and demeanor of the monk that I can smell from miles away whenever I see somebody who ordained there, or even in a Western branch (or perhaps *because* of that). I've even seen monks who were visiting here trying to walk perfectly in line and synchronize their steps when going on alms round, presumably in the way they used to do where they ordained (which monks here would find extremely strange and over-the-top). And the obsession with the neat requisites and the perfect color of the robe that ***has*** to be dyed with jackfruit and the way of folding the sitting cloth and insisting in doing the Patimokkha "the Thai Way" and the very particular method of folding the robe and the dark chocolate in the evening that's not allowed here...  pretty much being finicky about everything, using every opportunity they can to flaunt the fact that they're not just monks, but *Thai* monks.

    It also seems to be more of a thing there for senior monks to admonish juniors almost as an obligation, and it's more like a military command in general with absolute authority. Some Western monks also start internally enjoying that when they become seniors unfortunately. 

    Here it's much more relaxed and less uniform in comparison, except in the monasteries of the Galduwa tradition that are specifically "Monk Training Centers" (and even then, Sri Lankans kind of *can't* be so obsessive on average). Even in places like Na Uyana there is a lot of heterogeneity and room for non-conformity, whereas I've met Thai-ordained monks who get offended if I don't keep my hands in añjali throughout the entire Patimokkha, the way they do it there. In fact, pretty much all the faults of Na Uyana come from those contexts where the abbot is trying to be more like the Thai/Burmese, and laments the fact that Sri Lankans usually can't conform to that.

    So I can see it being very easy for a person in Thailand who is not already  extremely self-transparent to develop an attachment to "my tradition". But that's just what I've observed.

    Goodness, sounds awful.

    Have you tried going to a "meditation" place?

    I remember finding [this](https://placestomeditate.wordpress.com/2017/10/07/devanapathis-meditation-centre-sri-lanka/) a while ago.

    I think a good option might be finding a "meditation" environment that's not too strict, which at least technically should ensure less expectations of involvement with mundane stuff. As long as it's not compulsory, Burma-style group meditation boot-camp then you might be fine even if you have to attend meditation interviews, if they can see that you're not slacking around, although you may need to learn the subtle skill of discussing your meditation practice without explicitly calling out whatever they're teaching as wrong. Focusing on the very few similarities rather than the differences assuming you are trying to practice according to the Suttas if you end up having to engage in discussions. I suppose if push comes to shove, you could describe what you are doing to an untrained ear as an "open awareness practice". Technically that's not what it is, but that's accurate enough for that situation, and it's enough to know whether they're OK with it or not.

    If you end up considering going to the West, my advice would be to avoid places that are too politically-inclined and that will be pushing hardcore feminism down your throat. I haven't explicitly heard of that happening, but based on what I see Western nuns writing on the internet sometimes, I wouldn't be surprised.

    There are certainly injustices, but no one who has liberation as their #1 priority has time to become involved in that battle with the few years of valuable practice time they have left. In the best case scenario that *your* engagement turns the tide changes the world, by the time the goal is achieved, you will not only be old but will have cultivated a lot of ill-will and righteous indignation along the way, as well as further fueled the view that ***things that happen to you*** are what suffering is, not your ***craving*** in regard to things that happen to you.

    If you had trained your mind to see things in the latter way, you could not even muster the willingness to become involved with such things no matter how many injustices you experience, because that willpower is only present in someone who is *suffering internally* due to external circumstances, and you wouldn't be one of those people if you understood the Dhamma.

    Certainly nobody should be contributing to the oppression, but sacrificing the priority of wholesome states of mind for the sake of fighting against it is not a good idea if Nibbāna is truly the goal, and if one has remotely any clue how hard it is to attain it. (Interestingly, this is one of the ways in which adherence to meditation techniques makes you do things you probably wouldn't do otherwise. I am willing to bet that it's because of the underlying view that Nibbāna just "happens to you" if you become skilled enough at narrowing down your mental space and practicing forgetfulness that people are willing to engage in political activism while being "meditators" at the same time. The criterion of intention behind one's actions as what truly determines beneficial or unbeneficial, as that which you are *meditating on* and "feeding" your mind with whether you like it or not, is either not there or ignored).

    So I suppose it's possible that most places in the West would have that slight political bias, but as long as it's not strong enough interfere with your practice then it should not be a big issue. 

    I would also mention just in case that if I were you, I wouldn't disrobe even if I weren't able to find a place. It's unlikely that there is truly *nothing* (even though it may not be absolutely optimal in every regard), but also, putting up with these difficulties while __still__ valuing restraint, true renunciation and non-craving is developing your mind to some extent, in a way that even an 8-precept laylife, assuming you would keep it with the same rigor, probably wouldn't, or at least not with the same intensity, assuming you are matching the external robe with internal authenticity, heedfulness and not tolerating intentions of lay life.

    Ultimately, you should definitely try to get seclusion, but that doesn't mean that even in this situation if you stand your ground against the flood of sensuality at least *internally*―refuse to lose perspective and the recognition of akusala as akusala, to fall into complacency together with the rest ***while*** also refusing to tolerate ill-will against them when it inevitably arises―no progress at all is happening.

    Trying to get seclusion ASAP without resisting the pain of not having it is the way to go, because if you die today, that's the best possible mind state to have.

    I'll also be asking the abbot of where I am and another one I'll be visiting before I leave if they know any places for nuns more akin to our forest monasteries. I'll send you details of any recommendations.

    Edit: Also, I'm not sure if Thailand or Burma which are more "practice-oriented" generally may have better and more variery of places in the case of nuns, relaxed "meditation centers" at the very least, with less insistence on useless duties.

### Yoniso Manasikara

I have doubts that I understand Yoniso Manasikara correctly.

I attended a talk about Yoniso Manasikara at the Samanadipa monastery. Bhante Phasuko gave an example of how one should try to see their own face and, in a way, see behind one's experience. Just like how you can't see your eye, but you know it's there because of its absence. The moment I turned around and tried to look at myself, I discovered this hollow, empty place devoid of any possibility of ownership void. It felt as if might as well be dead, as far as it looks like.
Another example was given that if you put pressure on your finger to cause yourself a bit of pain and establish yourself in that order, you would not suffer.
So that place is where suffering can't follow.

After the unavoidable existential dread and full-on anxieties of meeting with the void and the literal uprooting of my assumed external sense-based ownership independent from the body, some time passed and I found myself again taking automatic ownership in the experience and hence suffering. Since then, I have been experimenting and trying to always have that establishment, but suffering still persists. It felt like I was managing my suffering with this kind of establishment and avoiding the responsibility of the pressure. And ironically, the greatest fruit of the practice!

This is why I was so thankful that Bhante Anigha took the time and explained to me about what samadhi really is and how to endure the pressure, and that pressure is actually rewarding you by enduring it correctly. I can't say that I have a good understanding of this because I am still missing the correct understanding of Yoniso Manasikara and how it all fits into the puzzle.

Another thing that confuses me is that I have heard Ajahn Nyanamoli speak about it, and what I understand from him is that Yoniso Manasikara is the context of whatever is happening in front of you, hence the diminishing of unwholesomeness because of that higher perspective.

But I have seen Bhante Anigha making a clear distinction between Yoniso Manasikara and the context. The context, to me, seems like it needs to develop from the painful lessons, and then if pondered sufficiently, it endures in the background, which should be Yoniso Manasikara.

Or is it just the ability, for example, to recollect the body posture, and that space is already Yoniso Manasikara?

So now, my practice was simply asking myself, "Do you want this?" while that image in my head endures. And it works - my mind initially touches it, but then it goes back like it has been burned as soon as the significance of the situation becomes apparent. It feels like the mind becomes dispassionate and doesn't want anything to do with that image. So experientially, it would be like things still appearing to you as the lack of something, and your senses reacting, but they pass right through you, and you're still at peace somehow. Not only that, but because of those pressures, you get more peace. Who would have guessed that such an absurd principle of chitta? This also helped me see exactly where that line is between the reactions of the animals and the mind's craving aspect. As soon as I see that the mind is latching onto something, I ask again, "Do you want this?"

    > Since then, I have been experimenting and trying to always have that establishment, but suffering still persists. It felt like I was managing my suffering with this kind of establishment and avoiding the responsibility of the pressure. 

    Yes, this is why it's always essential to remain self-honest, and to tell yourself that no matter how much you feel like you understood things, there ***has to be*** some way in which you're not even fully self-transparent yet unless you have the Right View. In fact, no matter what happens, even if you suddenly enter the fourth jhāna and get the triple knowledges and psychic powers one night, assume yourself to have made no progress whatsoever. That is the way to keep making *actual* progress.

    >Another thing that confuses me is that I have heard Ajahn Nyanamoli speak about it, and what I understand from him is that Yoniso Manasikara is the context of whatever is happening in front of you, hence the diminishing of unwholesomeness because of that higher perspective.

    Yes, that's what it is. "In front of you" also needs to be understood in a very general sense, as pretty much anything that you are aware of. Anything that is pressuring you.

    You could put it this way: instead of trying to *determine* "this much is that which is in front, and this much is that which is behind", which would leave your sense of self untouched, take *absolutely anything* that you find already there, arisen, including subtle things like restlessness, doubt, views, ideas, expectations, confusions, and and take that as your "in front". Then, your recognition of the *nature* of that whole experience is "the context". That's why that context ultimately doesn't have to be anything elaborate, it could just be a recognition that "I am thinking", *regardless* of what that thinking is about and the pressure it carries. That's how you would abandon doubt, for example, no matter how unpleasant it feels, and without trying to *stop* the thinking either.

    
    >But I have seen Bhante Anigha making a clear distinction between Yoniso Manasikara and the context. The context, to me, seems like it needs to develop from the painful lessons, and then if pondered sufficiently, ***it endures in the background, which should be Yoniso Manasikara.***

    >Or is it just the ability, for example, to recollect the body posture, and ***that space is*** already Yoniso Manasikara?

    It seems you partly misunderstood. I don't recall saying that yoniso manasikāra is a *result* of practicing the context (if you remember where it was I can clarify what the statement actually meant). 

    If anything it would be the other way around, yoniso manasikāra, which is what you need to be diligent with, is what would eventually make the context endure on its own without you needing to think about it.

    Regarding the phrase "that space is" that I highlighted above, I can't be 100% sure what you mean with that phrase but I will mention something just in case.

    It's better not to think of it as a "space" or something that you access or anything along those lines. That's because that will inevitably carry the implication that *you are doing it*, so to speak, and that's exactly why it's not actually the sufficient degree of yoniso manasikāra. That sort of attitude would turn even our descriptions of yoniso manasikāra into a "technique" that one would assume oneself, to one's misfortune, to already be doing rightly.

    Instead, again, as I wrote above, think of it as the practice towards overcoming your existence, and always tell yourself that there is a very large chance that you're not doing it correctly and that there is a part of your sense of self that is still "leaking out" of the container of the context, even if yoniso manasikāra "makes sense".

    It's about having an attitude of constant dissatisfaction with your practice, which is what gives rise to the right sense of urgency to develop it. If you do your best to be self-honest, it will always be obvious that the whole thing is still built on sand for the most part. And if you keep going like that, one day it will not be built on sand, but not because you were looking forward to that occasion. As the simile of the hen and the eggs in MN 16 goes, wishing distracts you from actually sitting on the eggs.

    Having said that, yes, recollecting your body posture on the right level, in the way that does not leave your sense of self out―i.e., when the inevitable thought of "I am entering this space" manages to gratuitously not be seen as within the context in one subtle way or another―is yoniso manasikāra. 

    >So now, my practice was simply asking myself, "Do you want this?" while that image in my head endures. And it works - my mind initially touches it, but then it goes back like it has been burned as soon as the significance of the situation becomes apparent. It feels like the mind becomes dispassionate and doesn't want anything to do with that image. So experientially, it would be like things still appearing to you as the lack of something, and your senses reacting, but they pass right through you, and you're still at peace somehow. Not only that, but because of those pressures, you get more peace. Who would have guessed that such an absurd principle of chitta? This also helped me see exactly where that line is between the reactions of the animals and the mind's craving aspect. As soon as I see that the mind is latching onto something, I ask again, "Do you want this?"

    Based solely on the verbatim description that could be along the right lines, but if *internally* it's right would depend. You would have to ask yourself to what extent asking yourself "do you want this?" is diminishing the pressure instead of adding a different significance to it.

    Also when you say "while that image in my head endures", I can't know for sure what you mean by that, but that could also mean taking the principle I referred to above of "yoniso manasikāra in regard to what's in front" too literally (a mistake which I initially made).

    If you want to ask yourself "do you want this?" on the right level, it would have to be something like your *entire experience and pressure* of being restless about something that's gonna happen tomorrow. You're not asking yourself whether you really want to go to that job interview after all, or something like that (that sort of coarse decision would be covered by sense restraint and virtue).

    In order to develop yoniso manasikāra, you need to be asking yourself whether you want to *welcome the possibility of trying to get rid of this situation of restlessness (in this example) in any way*, including looking at the particular images you are restless about and telling yourself they're not worth it. That would already be a form of acting out of restlessness, and would be the "wrong level".

    Going back to [this comment](https://reddit.com/comments/17v0cqw/comment/k9m9fpb) I wrote yesterday, sensuality is in fact the first hindrance also because if you understand what is the hindering aspect in it, you understand all the others too. 

    One has to be delusional to believe that one can volitionally stop perceiving the pleasure of an agreeable sense object, so by trying to overcome craving without denying that the pleasure is there, you force yourself to deal with the problem on the right level. That's why I wrote "you see ***this body*** as a charcoal pit", not "you bring up the pleasant image and tell yourself that ***that*** is a charcoal pit", which will force you to do the same thing again when the next image comes up.

    In the same way, whenever a pressure of any other kind is there, "do you want this?" should mean for you "do you want to try to wriggle out of what is already given―the "lack" of a pleasant object in this case which is itself a valid experience no matter how unpleasant it is―subjecting yourself to frustration on account of impermanence?", and ***not*** "how do I make what is already given, the "lack", not be there through asking this question?"

    In this way, you learn to be content and free from suffering in regard to torturous feelings, instead of evoking contentment so that torturous feelings don't arise, the "wrong level".

    >What you are asking from me is to take my whole life and just be observant of the characteristics of the experience regarding as if it's not my life. And not to let even a little bit of identification with any of it or any type of possibility of any alleviation of any situation that comes my way, no matter the severity of the situation.

    Yes, while also recognizing that that doesn't *have* to be unpleasant and anxious. It's not up to you to decide how severe the situation is, and how much alleviation will present itself as "needed". For a person who has not been keeping the precepts and restraint, there's probably gonna be pretty severe feelings arising, but either way it's not about *trying* to have those feelings so that you feel like you're progressing "faster" or something. Up to you is to be aware of whatever you're feeling it on the "right level", having established the strict virtue and sense restraint beforehand. Sometimes severe feelings will be there, sometimes not, and wanting to have only severe feelings is also a craving for certainty.

    >So, i should look at myself as this operating system that is happening by itself and trying to study it in an attempt to overcome it?

    It would depend what you mean by that. I would avoid phrasing it that way, since it gives off an implication that you can just "choose" to step back from the "operating system" and see it for what it is like someone who actually understood the five aggregates would. People would usually then end up trying to "look at the entirety of their experience" as another "doing"/technique, and they would be doing that *with* their sense of self.

    Describing the correct understanding of the experience as an "operating system" can also be misleading since it tends to imply that the feelings and significances of things are not supposed to be there. At least to my ears it's hard to use that sort of designation without it meaning that you're supposed to become a robot.

    Rather, the experience you're trying to be aware of on the right level is that of emotions, preferences, and internal reactions to things that have been conditioned by your past (and are now restrained from being lived out if they're rooted in craving), and you won't stop having those things internally no matter how "not mine" you learn to see them as, or at least it's utterly irrelevant where you stop having them or not because none of that needs to be denied. What needs to be abandoned first and foremost is the actions that "express" those emotions and preferences into the outside world to an unacceptable extent, addressed by 8 precepts and restraint, and then furthermore both the over-doing and under-doing of the context by repeatedly, hundreds of thousands of times, recognizing how you're missing the mark and re-adjusting the "right level" of yoniso manasikāra. That is the way of addressing your human emotions "internally" so that there is no craving in regard to them.

    The issue here is, when I say "context in regard to the entirety of the experience", you can't just sit down and start "zooming out" of your experience by choice. Recognizing that "entirety" requires a level of finesse, and if you overshoot the "stepping back", you will actually leave room for the sense of self still, and same if you undershoot it.

    And the difficult part is that no amount of instruction can directly ensure that you will reach that "balance point", because *internally* you can always be misinterpreting what you hear in the direction of either extreme, and being a puthujjana guarantees that. So it's a matter of relentless drilling and repetition, never assuming that you already got it (because assumption is always irrelevant).

    But that is more uncomfortable because it forces you to endure the uncertainty of the fact that you may not be "getting it" any time soon. And the mind has the tendency to only want to work if the reward is in sight. But then you include *that* uncertainty within the experience, and see it in such a way that you don't need to do anything about it no matter how intense it is. The true "balance point" is actually (subtly) unsettling for the undeveloped mind, ("feels incomplete" as Ajahn put it in the newest talk) and it finds even over-doing the effort more comfortable, because that allows the sense of self to find stability at least to some extent.

    
    >So the main focus is on understanding and not looking for a way out or going with something agreeable in your experience.
    That would be difficult because now there will be no rest, as I have to disregard even the comfortable safe zones that my mind provides me with and not delight in them.

    Yes, but you need to be aware that "going with something agreeable in your experience" doesn't mean agreeable things coming into range. The pleasure you should never go along with is the pleasure of *acting out* of the experience even mentally. In other words, you need to recognize where the "pull" on the level of background intention is, because that's the "reflexive"/peripheral pleasure the sense of self subsists on; the pleasure of the objects is secondary.

    If the "pull" is towards denying the pleasure that arises on its own and that has nothing to do with you, then following that intention would be "going with something agreeable in your experience" *on the level that matters.* If the pull is towards welcoming the pleasure then of course that will be wrong too if you follow it. 

    If the pull is towards making an unpleasant feeling more intense because you think that's somehow "speeding up" your practice, then that would also mean giving in to that peripheral level of pleasure. This is what the Jains were doing on a very course level, but it can be so extremely subtle that even the best Buddhist puthujjana is doing either this or indulgence by definition without realizing it, and they would realize it only by getting the Right View.

    One might even have heard the description of "existential anxiety" and "dismantling of the sense of self" on account of it, and one now derives a peripheral form of pleasure from making oneself stew in that emotional discomfort, and that means it's not the "right level" anymore, and the sense of self is still there. And ***that*** is a "safe zone", potentially even worse than all the others if one doesn't recognize it. 

    Like someone who was stranded in a jungle and was given directions of how to get out, and was told that at a certain point they would start seeing a certain kind of landscape if they were going in the right direction. But then they are too quick to assume that they're already out of the woods and cannot psychologically bear the thought that there might still be a long way to go, so they become delusionally complacent, and at some point some jungle predator gets them.

    >Is that why my "practice" is failing me and I'm not able to see the structure of my experience because I always try to interfere with it or always try to find a way out of the pressure. And although I have been following the 8 precepts for more than a year now, I have not been practicing correctly on the mental level?

    So no, your practice is not "failing you". The good news is that *because* you have taken on the 8 precepts and restraint, you are practicing rightly *to some extent* even in the worst of moments. 

    But yes, on the mental level you need to keep telling yourself that  it's still wrong. That's because you have no criterion yet to determine what "right" is, and you're still in the jungle. So you have to be prepared to accept that this is just 10% of the journey if that ends up being the case, because you *genuinely* have no idea and nobody else but you in the future if you manage to become a sotapanna can know in hindsight. You include *that* anxiety within the context and endure it, and stay on the lookout for any other ways in which you might be *reflexively* finding a sense of safety, meaning on the level of your choices in regard to your own mental states (immediacy).

    Because that's what the "safety" is ultimately―the wrong view that you are outside of your own experience in any level of subtlety, ***including*** as the unrecognized outside agent who is here and now practicing "no outsideness" on the wrong level, seeing not-self with self.

    >Needless to say, this helpful feedback loop encouraged the mind to continue pulling in the direction of relentless concern, but I am starting to come to terms with the fact that I may have raised and let loose a wild animal that seeks out and ferociously feeds on concern and urgency for its own sake. Although highly useful at first, its overall incompatibility with the aim of developing supreme composure is becoming apparent. 

    It''s kind of normal that one cannot just reach the Middle Way right away. Since almost everyone starts far in the direction of indulgence these days, it's almost inevitable that they will have to go equally far in the direction of denial so as to contain the sensuality.

    Not acting out towards sensuality always necessarily involves more composure than acting towards it, but yes, one needs to recognize that one is abandoning one hindrance with another, moving the problem somewhere else.

    >The key seems here not to raise and let loose another wild animal - one that feeds on safety and certainty - in order to destroy the original one, but to instead direct my efforts to starve out the original beast by subjecting it to the very same container of patient endurance that it helped to establish. This is how the knowledge and vision that is perpendicular to this potentially infinite and on-going beast-raising campaign arises, isn't it?

    Yes, you need to start recognizing how and to what extent whatever you're doing is actually a form of yielding to some "pull" or another, be it going with the grain of the world, or going too hard against it. The pull of sensuality might have diminished, but if it's because you're giving in to this other pull of "practice", then that's still needs to be upgraded __(although it is certainly necessary to start with)__. For as long as one is not able to endure the pull of defilements without the help of another form of pressure, one cannot be free from the grasping at virtue and practices.

    In the Suttas you see those laypeople who went back to live their lives almost as if nothing happened after getting the Right View, and that's what a person who is still misusing their practice against unwholesome as a form of distraction from the more unsettling, "silent noise" of the neutral feeling of *neither* indulging *nor* rejecting would not be able to do, because deep down they known that their progress will fall apart if they stop actively practicing.

    And the knowledge and vision that is "perpendicular" to the whole thing, as you put it, is that of the nature of choice as such, on any level of subtlety, and whether it's to welcome or deny things (this is what grasping the hints of the mind enables). As a puthujjana, one cannot help regarding denial as that which is wholesome if one has decided that indulgence is unwholesome, but a sotapanna is able to fully recognize *both* indulgence and denial as unwholesome and rooted in craving, and the Middle Way as wholesome.

    The idea that "craving is to be overcome by craving" applies only in the very broad sense that whether or not you practice, craving will be there either way. But it never means that one should, having already *taken up* the practice, justify forms of craving that one is aware of. The craving will be there inevitably if hypothetically an Arahant were to "examine" your mental state, but from *your point of view*, it should feel like you're not acting out of craving in either direction of indulgence or denial, because that's the only way to make progress instead of shifting the issue .

    At the point where one is sufficiently restrained and distant from the possibility of indulgence, one needs to then start developing that "perpendicular" direction, but for that, the coarse type of choices that one is used to will not work, and refining them is not a matter of choice either. It's a matter of trial and error and correcting course, always being self-transparent about one's shortcomings and subtle ways of acting out, never justifying craving, and being perpetually discontent with whatever progress one has made, coupled with __never__ breaking the restraint and precepts no matter how much you relax the over-tight effort. The actual restraint part never changes; what you're upgrading is your attitude and context behind it only.

    Yes, that's pretty much it. When you focus on an object, for instance, instead of practicing yoniso manasikāra, you are barring yourself from being able to include the sense of self within the context/mindfulness, as the range of what you're mindful of is so tiny and constricted, plus applying to an entirely different and irrelevant domain like bodily sensations, that it cannot possibly include the sense of self within it so as to start truly seeing what anattā is. Instead, you will be just seeing not-self with self, as MN 2 puts it, and getting all sorts of transcendental releases, experiences and "insights" of the wrong kind, which accord with the Buddha's teaching only *on the surface* (which is already the only thing a puthujjana sees).

    That is the coarsest way in the case of a meditation technique, but that principle of not recognizing the full range of the experience so that even the sense of self, no matter how subtle, is seen as depending on a "nutriment" can be much less obvious, and will be there for as long as one is not a sotapanna.

### Question about this HH video ???

At the 58 minute mark in this absolute gem of a Dhamma discussion they go really deep about not assuming an external self to your present experience. Upon repeated listens I think I’m starting to get it. But can someone give me a good example of a typical wrong assumption of an external self that I’m sure we all have the habit of doing. If I’m making any sense here?? lol

     > I think I’m starting to get it. 

    Maybe in theory if you hadn't before, but it's important to note that truly "getting it" has to result in the destruction of the first three fetters. 

    It is the general nature of every assumption that when you recognize it, it *cannot* come back. That's exactly why we call it assumption, whereas with "clinging" and similar, although it's technically not an inaccurate translation, the problem is it gives people the idea that as puthujjanas they can simply choose not to have upādāña for things and that they're basically in the same position as a sotapanna at that moment, and that assumption is catastrophic. You could talk about "clinging" and say that it's something that a puthujjana should avoid doing, but then you would have to be referring to something other than upādāna, which requires actual knowledge and vision to be removed and is not a matter of choice. And that "clinging" that they can avoid by choice, which could at times be beneficial as a form of Gradual Training, certainly wouldn't be on the level of the sense of self. It would only pertain to sense objects and coarse attachment towards opinions (which don't equal  views; views are much subtler). So one should practice that sort of "non-clinging", but without confusing it with the abandonment of upādāna. 

    
    >But can someone give me a good example of a typical wrong assumption of an external self that I’m sure *we all have the habit of doing.* 

    So what I'm saying is, yes, there is a "habit" of doing it, but , it won't actually be stopping even temporarily until one gets the Right View. You couldn't possibly take that habit back up once you actually abandoned it, since it would be like deliberately picking up a 100-pound load that you had absolutely no reason for carrying, having finally noticed that you had it on your back and dropped it.

    The implication of wanting to get "outside" of the experience is there to be recognized most acutely when there is the pressure of agreeable or disagreeable things. What the puthujjana's mind in either case (both of which are __painful__ in the [ultimate sense](https://suttacentral.net/sn36.5/en/bodhi?lang=en&reference=none&highlight=false) automatically assumes is that there is some sort of "base" where it can stand that is outside of the pressure being experienced, and that from that "base" it has the ability to control the feelings that arise.

    When the feeling is pleasant, it will assume that it has the power to increase that feeling, when it is unpleasant, the opposite.

    And why is it an assumption?

    >In dependence on the eye and forms there arises eye-consciousness. The eye is impermanent, changing, becoming otherwise;  forms are impermanent, changing, becoming otherwise. Thus this dyad is moving and tottering, impermanent, changing, becoming otherwise.

    >“Eye-consciousness is impermanent, changing, becoming otherwise. The cause and condition for the arising of eye-consciousness is also impermanent, changing, becoming otherwise. When, bhikkhus, eye-consciousness has arisen in dependence on a condition that is impermanent, how could it be permanent?

    >“The meeting, the encounter, the concurrence of these three things is called eye-pressure. Eye-pressure too is impermanent, changing, becoming otherwise. The cause and condition for the arising of eye-pressure is also impermanent, changing, becoming otherwise. When, bhikkhus, eye-pressure has arisen in dependence on a condition that is impermanent, how could it be permanent?

    >***“Pressured, bhikkhus, one feels, pressured one intends, pressured one perceives.*** Thus these things too are moving and tottering, impermanent, changing, becoming otherwise.

    ―SN 35.93

    Here is where it's crucial not to think that impermanence and dependent origination are "processes", which would only re-introduce the assumption.

    What the highlighted part means is that that "base" that a puthujjana assumes to be outside of whatever they're experiencing can only control the experience *through* intentions. So, if those intentions are provided by the experience/pressure, how could it be possible for those same intentions to be "applied" to the experience from the outside, so as to guarantee, in the way you assume, that the experience will change in the way you want it to?

    This is not to say that you can't choose to get up and start walking if you simply decide to do so. It's that the "level" where the pressure, the way it feels, you fundamentally can never change through the actions and intentions that are already *within it*. It would be like scratching the back of your hand with its own fingers. So you can basically do anything with those "fingers" (the arisen intentions/cetana) *except* do something to your hand, which is, in this case, the only thing that could guarantee your happiness.

    So, in a sense, it's not that there is "no outside" in some absolute sense, but rather that no matter how "outside" something feels, how much it feels like it will rescue you from the pressure you are experiencing, fundamentally it's still within that experience here and now. When you think about the brighter future and hope to bring it about through your intentions, that is within that situation here and now, and the outcome will be determined by that situation as a whole (including both internal and external factors) regardless of how much you crave for it to come about.

    Thus, it's not about determinism, as in saying that everything has a fixed course and thus whatever you do makes no difference, but that the outcome of your choices is always ultimately and fundamentally uncertain. That's because even if all the external factors are in place, fundamentally what you want is not an "object" in the world, really. What you want is a *specific form of pleasant pressure internally* in regard to the objects of the world. So even if you get exactly whatever *objects* and *perceptions* you want every single time, there is always plenty of room for the *experience/pressure* of the object to not be what you actually wanted, e.g. because you're in a bad mood now, and you have no say in that.

    If you truly had that outside "base" from which you can control what you feel the way that the mind naturally assumes, you would never suffer. You can certainly re-claim your happiness *sometimes* by commiting certain actions, but you should never lose perspective about the fact that every single time you succeed in that, it's pretty much by accident. Then you will realize that, even if there is a 99.9% chance of succeeding in getting what you want, it's never worth getting drunk on that possibility. Since you are not "outside" you will also have no escape from the increased unhappiness of you not getting what you wanted or losing what you had *at some point*, when the streak of luck ends, and you will be confined within that displeasure.

    (This is one of the reasons why people in the Buddha's time had less difficulty seeing the Dhamma on average. Now it is easier for the same or lesser amount of effort to lead to a greater amount of rewards, thus, on average, reinforcing the ignorance of the uncertainty of choices.)

    
    Edit: 

    >This is not to say that you can't choose to get up and start walking if you simply decide to do so. It's that the "level" where the pressure, the way it feels, you fundamentally can never change through the actions and intentions that are already *within it*.

    So you can start walking all you want, but there is ample chance that you will *not* stop feeling the displeasure of restlessness, for example, or that going where you want to go will not make you feel good.

### Praise and blame

I realized right now I’ve always hated being wrong because I always associated being wrong with blame from others. And the same is true for why I’ve loved being right; an implicit love for praise. I used to go out my way to get praised by others, at least that coarse level of behavior is not longer present in me. But love for right and hate for wrong are still really just disguises for praise and blame.

How to overcome praise and blame? What are the drawbacks, danger, and escape with regards to praise and blame? How does one see them? I can list the drawbacks on a mundane level, but I’m tired of mundane stuff.

Wanting praise and not wanting blame are still sensuality, so I suppose seeing the danger in sensuality would have to result in overcoming praise and blame?

    >Wanting praise and not wanting blame are still sensuality, so I suppose seeing the danger in sensuality would have to result in overcoming praise and blame?

    Not all the way. You could lay out two types of concern for praise and blame:

    The first is related to the first three fetters, and is basically the fact that one is affected negatively when one's *views* are criticized and elated when they're praised. Abandoning that *through knowledge of the nature of views*, not through *deciding* to stop holding them or to not be attached, would make one incapable of being moved by praise and blame on that domain. In fact, if you were to *directly* try to not hold any views so as to not be concerned about praise or blame, you would have to prematurely relinquish mundane Right View and the utterance of another.

    Furthermore, concern for place and blame on the ultimate level is something that only an Arahant has overcome. In fact, the craving for being and craving for non-being of an anāgāmi could be illustrated best by their concern for reputation, family, honor- that sort of thing. It's a consequence of the 5 higher fetters still being there: "formless" lust, conceit, restlessness and (very subtle) ignorance.

    >How to overcome praise and blame? What are the drawbacks, danger, and escape with regards to praise and blame? How does one see them? I can list the drawbacks on a mundane level, but I’m tired of mundane stuff.

    It's essentially the same as with feeling in general. Do your best to completely understand feeling in the utmost general sense and your gratuitous attitude of welcoming and resisting it, and you become a stream-enterer (you don't become an Arahant yet), meaning you will be able to endure praise and dispraise without being affected. Then do the same thing again, you become an Anāgāmi eventually. Repeat once more, and *then* you become an Arahant, completely unaffected.

    So there's nothing special you need to do in this case, and it's not like you need to stop experiencing displeasure when other people criticize you or feeling pleased when they praise you, because that's not on you. What is on you is the lack of context of that feeling not being in your control, which will then mean that if it changes, if suddenly everyone begins to think you're an idiot, you will suffer. If the context in regard to feeling is established, then no matter how nice it feels to be praised or annoying to be criticized, there would be no suffering.

### Re: The Foundational Reality of Humans as Primates, and the Justifiability of the Path

Replying to u/DhammaGhoul's reply to my question on [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/17udn4g/question_for_bhikkhu_anigha_extracted_from/):

>I mean, what else is on offer exactly? We observe what appears to be other entities existing independently of our perception, or at least are part of consensus reality. We observe that they have occasional mutations that affect biology or behavior. We know that various environmental demands for survival and reproduction are more or less favorable for some of the newly cropped up traits. Because they are more favorable to survival and reproduction those traits get reproduced at a higher frequency and slowly spread across the population and over time form organisms with bodies and behaviors exquisitely tailored to their environment niche. Those behaviors seem to include aversion to harm or loss of resources and seeking out of benefit (or sex) and acquisition of resources.

Sure, but ultimately none of this proves that there is not a "foundational reality" (of the Four Noble Truths) *in regard to all of this* which you are talking about and which is infinitely more fundamental than it.

>You could argue a solipsistic or extreme idealism view that the material world is nothing like our perceptions and so all of that biological evolutionary conjecture is built on sand, but this seems rather odd to me and I’m not sure how it provides reason for behaving with non-harm towards these fake people and animals. Or you could argue for some sort of creationism, but I don’t see good reason to believe in that and lots of reason to believe in the contrary.

Yes, and that solipsism would be built on sand too.

**Here's the gist of it:**

All of us are entirely biological entities.

This does not invalidate the Dhamma; rather, it makes practicing it not optional if one seeks one's own welfare.

The behaviors and biological drives that you describe are an undeniable reality of *even* in the Arahant's experience, and there is basically no need to deny anything that science says as far as the body, biology and chemistry go (except when it gets into the realm of "explaining" consciousness and the mind, at which point it necessarily fails to be coherent, given that you would be (mis)using it to explain that which you're using to (mis)use science to try to explain that which you're using...)

A male or female Anāgāmi or Arahant perceives a prospective mate or a meal if they're hungry, and their body still reacts on a physiological level, and, if you insist, you could argue that this has been conditioned by millions of years of evolution (although the Suttas give a different story of how the world and humans came about, but we can put that aside for now), and they have no say in it for as long as their body lasts. And whatever processes take place "in the brain" when they perceive something disagreeable, say when they hear insults directed at them or come into contact with repulsive things, are also not in their control.

Every single phenomenon that serves as the *basis* for delight and aversion arises due to chemicals in your body, if you want to say it that way. This is why you won't be having even the pressure to think certain thoughts until you've gone through puberty, for example, or when you're gravely ill as an adult.

The Buddha tended to summarize all this with the following sort of statement:

>“Form, Rādha, is impermanent/suffering/nonself, feeling is impermanent/suffering/nonself, perception is impermanent/suffering/nonself, volitional formations are impermanent/suffering/nonself, consciousness is impermanent/suffering/nonself.

And "Māra", whose existence we also don't need to take on trust, or whom we could, for all intents and purposes, call "Mother Nature", expressed[ the same thing in different words](https://suttacentral.net/sn4.19/en/bodhi?lang=en&reference=none&highlight=false).

So, in brief, everyone's problem on this earth, including animals, is that they are a *victim* to their biology/internal chemistry. This is a problem because, fundamentally, it is impossible to guarantee that one will always be able to satisfy these biological urges, and the actions one is forced to undertake in order to quell them put one at risk of experiencing loss and displeasure that [would not be there otherwise](https://suttacentral.net/mn13/en/sujato?lang=en) (this is not the most fundamental reason why sensuality is harmful, but it should suffice for this discussion).

What the Suttas are offering us is the way to cultivate the understanding of "gratification, danger and escape" with regard to our biology, so that despite still feeling a shadow of the impulse to engage in the behaviors that biology dictates necessary, we are entirely at ease with saying "no" if we know that they'll lead to suffering (i.e., if they're rooted in passion or aversion) . In other words, we not only stop listening to our biology in cases where lust, aversion, and distraction are involved, but we also learn to no longer resist the displeasure that arises on account of this, which was the entire cause of the suffering, *not* the fact that the biological urges were being unmet (*craving*, not *feeling,* is the root of suffering).

This is basically why the Suttas refer to the 4 paths and fruits and even samādhi states as "**superhuman** attainments". It's not mere poetry.

>name *any* behavior you engage in between waking up in the morning and going to sleep at night that is not governed, fundamentally, by the “three poisons” (or at least the craving/aversion poles). Are there any at all? Look closely at the best candidate example- is there not a subtle pleasure being sought or discomfort being avoided? Aside from involuntary responses (sneezing, etc) I can think of none. \[...\] My concern is that I'm not sure freedom from craving and aversion is really a possibility for biological organisms in our planet.

This is losing sight of the forest for the trees, and it's very common among modern Buddhists. People would resolve to not change posture even if their knee hurts during a meditation session in the name of "not acting out of aversion", while in their daily life they don't bat an eye when they engage in actions of a blatantly unwholesome kind (i.e., rooted in passion or aversion, even if not outright immoral).

There are fundamentally only five things (explained in MN 76) that an Arahant is incapable of doing, and those are the things that one categorically needs to abstain from in order to practice towards that goal. Why is that? Because they're are the things that *cannot* be done without taking ownership of your biological drives. Basically any other action can *at least in principle* be performed while still seeing the drive towards it as "not mine" (which is practically measured by how the Arahant's mind wouldn't suffer at all if the arisen bodily urge went unmet; that is not to say that no feeling of displeasure would arise, since even affectivity, not only "sensations", is inseparable from one's physiology, and craving is something additional to that).

The main issue when people bring up biology in the context of Dhamma is that they use it to justify indulgence in their desires, as if evolutionary conditioning and whatnot absolves them from responsibility for the actions *they* choose to make when their bodies try to coerce them to. But if we can take our biological conditioning as a given, while *also* recognizing that we are utterly and fundamentally free to choose to give in to it or not, regardless of how hard it tries to assert itself, then the Middle Way becomes intelligible at least in principle.

The only thing that really needs to be taken on faith in the beginning is that if you continue to restrain your *choices* without trying to suppress the biological drives themselves, at some point you will stop experiencing even a desire to act out of those drives *while the drives remain.* That's because initially it will inevitably seem like the pressure of the bodily drive and the mental inclination to succumb to it are one and the same thing. But fortunately they aren't.

    I should also add: this is why the Buddha always regarded the going forth "in one's youth, in the prime of life, with fully black hair" as more  beneficial, and completely disagreed with the common Indian view that the holy life should be lived *after* enjoying sensual pleasures and growing old.

    The "drives", "reactions to pheronomes", "impulses" have become weaker by that time, and thus it is more difficult to measure what really needs to be done: i.e., make the mind completely dispassionate __*while*__ those things are there. 

    An old person can much more easily dupe themselves into thinking they don't have much craving and possess equanimity.

    Reply to u/Various-Junket-3631:

    >So while it is tempting to say that these symptoms will last for the remainder of my life (and into the next lives), I can’t definitively say that they will, even if I have the sense that they will. And yet I am not bothered by this. In any case, I am not sure how to describe or explain the “permanence” of the stream enterer’s attainment. I would like to hear your thoughts.

    That is a good criteria for what actually constitutes stream entry and not simply a mundane insight. One needs to have understood the fundamental nature of experience in such a way that one is perfectly certain that, if one's memory were to be wiped or one were to get Alzheimer's, there is no way that the insight would be forgotten. This is because only such an insight has gone beyond "the All", beyond the range of "Mother Nature", and by extension, beyond saṁsāra.

    One can technically have understood the body and so on even as an ordinary person, but for as long as this knowledge of the body depends on a specific *thought or memory*, one's understanding is still "biological", i.e. tied to this specific form, and will thus perish when it does.

    Note that I am not equating freedom here to some mystical truth behind the 6 senses that is "beyond description". It is something that one would be able to both see for oneself beyond doubt and also accurately elucidate phenomenologically in many ways, which is all the Buddha did for 45 years.

    >Then there is the question of actually being reborn as a stream enterer. Anathapindaka notably was reborn as a deva and was even heard to praise Sariputta. However I see both knowledge and memory as conditioned. It has struck me as quite odd that someone might be reborn with knowledge of dhamma. And yet the first question is cause for curiosity here.

    A human would certainly not be "reborn" (I should note that this term and "rebirth" are actually inadequate, but I will continue to use them here for simplicity's sake) with any knowledge of Dhamma at all. It would be a blank slate. Hence what I wrote above.

    Since devas inhabit a naturally more elevated state of mind (citta), they also have unobstructed recall of many things that an ordinary human could not ever hope to remember. But that's something one may choose to be agnostic on without repercussions, and focus instead on the fact that things can only be remembered as a result of this body having a functioning nervous system (which would begin to reveal the impermanence of everything, including the fruits of Dhamma practice that are still not "on the right level" as in a noble disciple).

    >After all, wouldn’t such a person be capable of assuming a Buddha’s position in the next life if this were the case?

    A noble disciple assuming a Buddha's position later on would not be possible. A Buddha is defined by the fact that he finds the way out without anybody's help, and that is simultaneously the reason why his wisdom (if we put aside claims of psychic powers and such) is far beyond what anyone else could attain. The fact that a Buddha discovers the Dhamma by himself, transcends "Mother Nature" without any outside help, **and** is able to then teach it well (unlike a Paccekabuddha) acts as a filter to ensure that whoever achieves that will have to be a one-of-a-kind individual.

    >So perhaps it is something else that persists beyond rebirth—this detachment maybe?

    You could say it that way, but it is inherently impossible for one to understand what that "detachment" is without noble insight. That's because up until that point, whatever one calls "detachment" is ultimately still biologically determined, and is linked to the memories and notions that have been accumulated in this body, even if, with the proper functioning of the body as condition, such notions seem to remain steadily of their own accord.

    ――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――

    Now a comment on "rebirth" in general:

    The reason why I said the term itself is inaccurate is because it creates a connotation that your "soul" or something along those lines, sort of "went" somewhere after "leaving" this body (and we may imagine some sort of smoke or ray of light rising out of our corpse after we die and entering a fertilized egg in another part of the world immediately). The Buddha would've ridiculed this idea, and it's not how it works. Even the term "new life" is questionable, and neither this nor "rebirth" actually exist in Pāli.

    An account of how a noble disciple would be totally confident about the existence of past and future lives could be made in the following way:

    >Transparent, bhikkhus, is this mind, but it is defiled by adventitious defilements. The uninstructed worldling does not understand this as it really is; therefore I say that for the uninstructed worldling there is no development of the mind.” 

    >“Transparent, bhikkhus, is this mind, and it is freed from adventitious defilements. The instructed noble disciple understands this as it really is; therefore I say that for the instructed noble disciple there is development of the mind.” ―AN 1.51-52 (my translation)

    This is not referring to some mystical, luminous mental image, but to the understanding of the fundamental structure of existence. When one learns how to overcome the five hindrances, which is what makes one a noble disciple, one gets to see that whatever can be called a "defilement" is actually gratuitous, as in, there is no inherent reason why it has to be there at all, and once you recognize that, *it can't be there.*

    To give a practical example, going back to the topic of biological drives, when your mind is overcome by the desire induced by the smell of your favorite food, if that mind is not developed, it will automatically fall prey to that pull, not necessarily through coarse actions, but mentally at the very least. Even if you do your very best to restrain yourself, there would still be a tacit assumption that *the pull itself* is the defilement.

    (continued below)
    - **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/17v0cqw/re_the_foundational_reality_of_humans_as_primates/k9aa0oo/)** _2023-11-14 23:53:51 *(in reply to a comment not included)*:

        But the noble disciple has fully understood that the defilement there is *not* the force of attraction experienced by the body towards the food, but rather their tacit **assumptions** (*upādāna*) in regard to that force (assumptions of "mine", fundamentally, which is the only way that it can be felt necessary to satisfy the urge in any way).

        The fundamental nature of assumption is that it's there because the truth has never been known. You cannot at some specific point begin to assume that the Earth even theoretically could be flat (as the ancients did), unless you have never gone into outer space and seen it. If you assume that at all, you have been assuming it always*,* even before you ever explicitly thought about it. All assumptions are inherently *beginningless* in that sense. Similarly, assumptions cannot come to an end by themselves, without a new piece of knowledge being introduced into the picture.

        In this way, a noble disciple would be able to know, through an inference made possible only by their new understanding, that there cannot possibly have been a first point to this situation of being pressured by biological/bodily impulses and tacitly assuming them as "mine" (not even as an embryo, where the word "mine", "pressure", "assumption", and all abstract concepts for that matter, were beyond their grasp). [It's impossible that at one point he would've not been ignorant, and then he *became* ignorant](https://suttacentral.net/sn48.50/en/sujato), because it's an ignorance of the most overarching kind that encompasses one's entire existence from top to bottom. It's not like the ignorance of the meaning of a passage in a book or of somebody's name, which can come to be when before it was not. Such is the case only for ignorance that happens *within* biology/the body/aggregates, whereas the fundamental *avijjā* is in regard to the nature of the aggregates as a whole.

    >This "superhuman" understanding that is not dependent on biology - as I currently see it - is known as such precisely because it contains the domain of thought itself (i.e. the peripheral image of the body is itself dependent upon a nature that is always necessarily "one step ahead" of that image).

    Yes, you could say at that point you are not even "arranging" things on the level of thought, body, peripheral, image, etc. There simply is "this", and no passion in regard to it, no matter what that "this" is. That "this" needs to apply to *everything* and *anything*, including any implications of the past and possibilities for the future. 

    >Bhikkhus, do you see: ‘This is present’?” —“Yes, venerable sir.”—“Bhikkhus, do you see: ‘Its presence is with that as nutriment’?”—“Yes, venerable sir.”—“Bhikkhus, do you see: ‘With the cessation of that nutriment, is what is present subject to cessation’?”—“Yes, venerable sir.”

    >“Bhikkhus, does doubt arise when one is uncertain thus: ‘Is this present’?”—“Yes, venerable sir.”—“Bhikkhus, does doubt arise when one is uncertain thus: ‘Is its presence with that as nutriment’?”—“Yes, venerable sir.”—“Bhikkhus, does doubt arise when one is uncertain thus: ‘With the cessation of that nutriment, is what is present subject to cessation’?”—“Yes, venerable sir.”

    ―MN 38

    (Note the absence of doubt, indicating these bhikkhus saw it clearly and must've had at least the Right View, thus needing no specific definition of what "this" is).

    So:

    >An image *appears*, and to that extent it implies an enduring structure fully outside of one's ownership, which is always based *upon an appearance*.

    Yes, that's what one needs to start seeing, by first trying to understand yoniso manasikāra intellectually and gradually learning how to depend on that theory less and less while still very much seeing the principle on a concrete level. You basically want your understanding of the structure of experience and its unownability to transcend even the biological basis of memory and reasoning, which is the only way to be your own guide (sotapatti), and for that understanding to carry over even after you die.

    (In the process of that, you would also cease to depend on things like phenomenology and existentialism, which are ultimately biologically-determined ways of making sense of the task to be done: overcoming your own very intellect while it's there).

    >The mind established on this structural level is no longer *subjected to* the coarser biological images and ideas of birth, death, dementia, "what-if" or "is it the same, different, or neither the same nor different?" etc.

    You could say that ultimately the mind that truly sees Nibbāna is not even "established on a structural level". That's why a sotapanna can become an Arahant at the moment of death if they make the effort and had enough wisdom beforehand.

    The *structure in its entirety* is what needs to be overcome. Establishing the mind in a more fundamental aspect of the structure is what samādhi and jhāna is, not Nibbāna.

    It would indeed be a misunderstanding to take the fact that your citta is not within your 6 senses to be a good thing. Literally, if you were to have only 6 senses and no citta, or if they were to intermingle, there would be no issue at all (and you wouldn't exist either).

    All your suffering is due to your citta, and the main problem is that you can never directly control it like you can turn your head, not even as a result of practice. You can only train it to do what's good for you, but because even if you "train it" it's still a separate entity, so to speak, you can never actually take any form of refuge in it. Or rather, you'd better not try to.

    You can reflect on how no matter how much control you may exert, you don't know if you'll be in a good mood one hour from now. That's because neither the sense objects nor the way your citta responds to them is in your control. Your actions and control are *made possible* by the experience of sense objects, and choosing certain actions (restraint, recollection of right context, avoidance of unnecessary exposure to temptations) over others indirectly tames the citta.

    [This here is related.] (https://reddit.com/comments/17909gs/comment/k580iqb)

    Edit: Also, the fact that the citta is not in your control does turn into a good thing once you develop it. That's why we say when the mind is developed, unwholesome things and craving cannot arise "even if you want them to" (similar to what I wrote above about how whatever an Arahant does cannot rooted in craving, even if they were to start doing stuff that would agitate a normal person when there is a purpose).

    Not quite; I would expect to hear that from contemporary Buddhists generally, who are far from the Middle Way.

    What I am getting at here is that "lesser" craving and aversion will be truly and ultimately determined by a more developed mind. There is no way to *truly* have less craving apart from that, and that is something one does not have direct control over. One can only cease to ***fuel*** craving, pretty much. One cannot "have less of it" from one moment to the next by simply choosing a different action.

    The idea that a different action can be said to involve "less craving" is founded still in the notion that actions somehow carry their own intrinsic properties in terms of wholesome and unwholesome. They don't (even the 5 precepts and celibacy are pre-determined as out of bounds for an Arahant not because of the *actions* but because of the mental attitude they necessitate beforehand) and choosing to, say, contemplate the Dhamma, read Suttas and keep the precepts will not be rooted less in craving than the occasion when the same person goes and acts out of lust or aversion. Hence the person who regularly commits actions which *fuel* craving, would be doing the former inadvertently with a very different attitude than the person who has been abstaining from such actions for a long time, and there is absolutely no way that they would be able to tell, because for a puthujjana craving is "hidden" (because they don't know how to recognize it right in front of their nose, not because it's "subconscious" or something like that).

    In other words, their *Dhamma practice* would be that much more affected with sensuality and craving, illustrated for example by how they may choose to invest effort in things like setting up a beautiful shrine or trying to inform everyone they can about how wonderful Buddhism is.

    So you could say the gradual path is one of choosing things that will inevitably be rooted in the same amount of craving, but will not be fueling the craving *in the mind*, so that as the obstacles (5 hindrances) to understanding gradually diminish over time, and one is also making effort to recognize the lack of benefit in the actions that one has for the moment only superficially abandoned, eventually the recognition that the mind is fundamentally "transparent" can take root, as I explained above, and *then* a person can have less craving in the ultimate sense. Before that, we can speak of "less craving" in an ordinary person only inasmuch as the present circumstance is not arousing it (which is good, one should set up one's circumstances in order to have less symptoms of craving to deal with, without falling into the extreme of running away from everything).

    Fundamentally, the same degree of craving is always there, waiting to spring into action, unless superhuman attainments are present  (including the jhānas which can be attained by a puthujjana without ceasing to be one in rare cases). What can happen for an ordinary person is that the craving "moves" from one thing to another (e.g. a still ignoble Dhamma practice), the new thing being inherently less risky and less impermanent, and thus there is less suffering felt. Or it "spreads out" over more things, so to speak. Thus, the "symptoms" of the illness can be allayed, almost without limit (which is what happens in anyone who is skilled at contemporary meditation, pretty much), without the actual illness changing one bit.

    The illness of craving cannot *actually* diminish without at least a true jhāna, "true" being defined by its transcendence of the entire "All" without getting rid of anything within it, hence the Buddha compared it to Nibbāna in the [AN 9.47](https://suttacentral.net/an9.47/en/sujato?lang=en) I've been quoting, meaning that there is no room for craving to "shift" somewhere else within that All, and so it has no choice but to *actually* decrease. 

    This is why such a person would probably not become a stream-enterer, but an anāgāmi upon hearing the Dhamma for the first time if they were skilled in the practice of jhāna (whose very development would have resulted in stream entry long ago in *most* cases if they'd received Buddhist instruction).

    Furthermore, 

    >Thank you Bhante, I always enjoy your writing and I appreciate you adopting the frame reference

    Sure, but I would also point out that it's not just "a frame of reference" in the sense that it needs to be taken as a provisional way of approaching the Dhamma, or that I sacrificed accuracy here in order to present a compelling argument (which would be counterproductive). You could literally use this as your framework from now onwards and it wouldn't make a difference from the way traditional Buddhists think in terms of obstructing you from understanding the Dhamma, for as long as you never forget the part I wrote about how biological drives are never justifications for *actions*, and that the latter are always utterly in one's responsibility (this is the "Mundane Right View").

    This goes to show that the Dhamma *is* a "foundational reality" that will continue to apply *regardless* of what sort of "reality" you believe in, so to speak. Whoever says that the belief in the reality that a traditional Buddhist puts their trust in, shaped by cosmological principles and by assertions that scientists would generally  roll their eyes at is somehow necessary has not understood what the Dhamma actually is. Fundamentally, that belief of theirs, being not rooted in knowledge-and-vision, is to the exact same extent rooted in the minuscule threshold of recognition of what the physical world is that I mentioned above, they are simply choosing to go in one direction instead of the other.

    So to finish off, I would mainly advise not to try to interpret all this according to anything you've heard been touted as "Buddhism" before. It would lead to confusion.

    >I recall Buddha telling that a puthujjana can only have two views in regards to the self - annihilationism and eternalism.

    That is true.

    >I am falling prey to the second one. I don't even know if this line of reasoning is something I should continue with since honestly I can't even discern where this citta is and signs of it. 

    That's because you're still most likely trying to "wrap your head around it". That will never work, because your head and your citta are not in the same domain (literally, your mind is not "in your head").

    It could also be that if you think it's leading you to "eternalism" then it's because of a misunderstanding of what eternalism and annihilationism are, which is necessarily concomitant with the adherence to either of them (for otherwise they are both  transcended). For example, Buddhists who have the view that anicca and anattā are about things having "no substance" and being "empty of intrinsic essence" (lord knows whatever that even means), that "nothing really exists", would hear us saying that there is a citta that is outside of the impermanent 6 senses and they would automatically accuse us of eternalism and Advaita Vedanta. That's because their criterion of what eternalism is is misguided, and what they're genuinely conceiving of as the Middle Way between the two is actually still a subtle form of annihilationism. 

    As you yourself mentioned, this is inevitable, but if one is aware of it then one will not obstruct one's progress on account of it. 

    The main problem problem as a puthujjana is one expects an easy way out of dukkha that one can simply "agree" with without partaking in it already, and that's why one is unable to endure the pressure to fall into one of the two extremes, no matter how hard one tries, and even if one is, say, the Buddha's personal attendant who knows everything he ever said and studies it intensely. That's just how ignorance works, and recognizing that "confinement" within blindness motivates one to at least stop fueling it.

    As to the citta:

    Can't say for sure, but it's also possible that you may be exaggerating your intepretation of when we say that it cannot be grasped as an object all the way to that it *cannot be grasped*, period. That would certainly result in eternalism.

    Now, you *are* eternally paired with your citta if you don't get the Right View, but that doesn't mean what the ordinary person thinks it means. It doesn't mean you will get to keep any of the things you are attached to, at all. It simply means you are forced to continue *experiencing experience* as such, without beginning and without end.

    You could say there are five buckets, and all that is happening in your wandering through saṁsāra is the fact that those buckets are being emptied and refilled again. But the thing is, what you would be pleased on account of it being eternal *is never the buckets*, it's that which is *in them* (meaning whatever manifests as form, perception, feeling, intention, consciousness, far or near, inferior or superior, etc.) And that will always get completely destroyed everytime you die, and you would be able to have only memories and perceptions of it if you develop your mind in the next life. You would never call even those memories "my self", as having them is not very pleasing at all, hence remembering them is the second higher knowledge in the Suttas resulting from the fourth jhāna which contributes to the dispassion necessary for the third, Arahantship.

    Think of the citta as the background attitude that is present towards anything that has arisen. Related to the discussion here, your citta would become clear as day (without "grabbing" it as an object, which means it's not the citta) if you managed to understand that, despite how much your body might crave for certain objects, it is possible to __peripherally experience__ that *entire phenomenon of the six sense base "pulling"*, allowing it to endure without denying it, as "a charcoal pit, deeper than a man's height." 

    You would then implicitly have gotten to see that there is something there upon which things only have a "delayed effect"―effect that accumulates based solely on your choices in regard to that world (having been restrained and  contemplated the right context of danger long enough, in this case), unlike your 6 senses which are affected immediately by the pressure of objects, and there isn't much you can do to change that except avoid the objects or try to modify their significance (what we call "management", "psychotherapy", or alternatively "contemporary Buddhism"). This "cumulative effect" is what MN 19 refers to as the mind inclining to either type of thinking―meaning to either type of mood/background attitude, not to *objects*. Virtue in body and speech alone, which entails making choices that you authentically recognize you are fully responsible for, is already having such an "effect", hence it factually makes one live in less suffering, whereas a meditation technique modifies the *objects*, which is pointless.

    
    But this citta that you incline in the right direction is ultimately unreliable and not a refuge, because the fact is, not being completely dispassionate towards it entails needing to make choices whether you like it or not, and that's oppressive. The citta having been tamed is the result of jhāna practice and Gradual Training, and that's why MN 64 describes how once that's developed, you then need to reflect upon *that* as "impermanent, as suffering, as a disease, as a tumour, as a barb, as a calamity, as an affliction, as alien, as disintegrating, as void, as not self", so that now even the purified citta, that still entails a form of action that will put subtler forms of content within the five buckets in a future life, will be abandoned.

    
    And:

    >I am hoping that things will become clearer with the gradual training.

    Yes, on a more immediate level, if you want to get to not-ignore (as opposed to "see" or "figure out") the citta where it is, that's what you need to undertake (and non-company as well for prolonged periods). Essentially, for a puthujjana, which we could define as a person who cannot overcome the hindrances, the citta and the senses are like two panes of glass glued together. They're not supposed to be like that because they're *two*, not *one*, but there is no first point at which they were separate and became joined. Gradual Training is the only thing that can begin to outline the fact that they are two. Otherwise, literally, whatever your body wants is what your citta wants and is allowed to go towards by default, and thus they remain glued together.

    Edit: It's also useful to note that, in the end, the citta is a *structure*; it's not one unitary thing. We and the Suttas present it like that only for the sake of simplification. It will probably be abstract, but "Hierarchy of Awareness" in Meanings explains this in detail.

    Since it's not a *unit*, you can't possibly take it to be "me" or "mine" unless you misconceive it.

    Yes, citta is that which can be aware (not in some new-agey, mystical sense). 

    That's why not having "tamed" your citta through Gradual Training, not having trained it to stop [delighting in company](https://suttacentral.net/AN6.68/en/sujato) means you can't even practice [recollection and awareness](https://suttacentral.net/SN47.8/en/sujato). It's not something that you get "meditation instructions" for and then just do it.

    The latest [talk](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=psApaFXI_QU) goes into how satisampajaññā is something that that "hierarchy" needs to do *on its own*, not something you're manipulating  with your volition, which is how people usually do it. Even those who see the futility of techniques will be trying to "arrange" the reflexive hierarchy if they don't have the Right View,—the one that should actually be [endured](https://suttacentral.net/SN35.228/en/sujato) in order to practice sati.

    But what is written in "Hierarchy of Awareness" will be unnecessarily abstract and complex for most people. I mentioned it only to illustrate that the citta is not some mystical entity and that its nature can be described phenomenologically. It's just that the ordinary person will be looking at the wrong place whenever they try to recognize it (due to the habits and actions that have made them even more dependent on the *objects* of the more "palpable" hierarchy).

    At the end of the day, people will fail to recognize the hierarchy not because they couldn't wrap their head around the subject of the essay, but because of the insufficient un-absorption into the other hierarchy, diminished through none other than the Gradual Training.

    The "pheromones" are not the arousal. Rather, it is the desire and lust in regard to the reaction the pheromones evoke that is the arousal there.

    >Bhante, is assumption (upādāna, sensuality being one of the 4 types) identical with the five aggregates affected by assumption, or is assumption separate from the five aggregates affected by assumption?”

    >“Monk, assumption is not identical with the five aggregates affected by assumption, nor is assumption separate from the five aggregates affected by assumprion. Monk, the desire and lust in regard to the five aggregates affected by assumption is the assumption there".

    —MN 109

    Referring to my comment you linked with the Vinaya passage, it mentions that an Arahant is incapable of an erection due to sensual desire. That is correct.

    This will sound outlandish to the average person, especially if they haven't been living celibately for a long time, but that is because the bodily reaction to  "pheromones" does not and cannot induce an erection by itself. What "pheronomes"  induce on the relevant level is [a pleasant feeling](https://suttacentral.net/36.5/en/bodhi) that is [actually painful](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=WNotZXYWV-0), and on the irrelevant level things like "butterflies in your stomach" (irrelevant because bodily sensations have nothing to do with feelings—where the craving and suffering is—and instead they are within the aggregate of perception). None of that involves craving if the mind is developed, and it in fact reminds you of the fact that this primate existence is a charcoal pit in its entirety, allowing the mind to withdraw from it peripherally and be at ease.

    That is why Ven. Anuruddha in this story still ["withdrew his faculties"](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6/en/brahmali?lang=en&layout=linebyline&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin) from the woman that was trying to seduce him. Nobody wants to get even closer to the charcoal pit than they already are simply due to having this body. It's not because he was afraid of the pressure. Most Buddhists would instead think that for an Arahant this situation should be the same as looking at a sunset, and that he withdrew his faculties out of some puritanical sense of duty and actually did not perceive the significance because nothing really exists or whatever, and that's because of the completely wrong view of what equanimity is that hopes to *destroy the aggregates*, not abandon passion for them.

    Pheromones and the sighting of a potential mate in the human primate can lead to an erection only if their *citta* has a perversion of perception, where it perceives that pleasure as pleasant, instead of as painful as it truly is (the two links above)—and if it perceives the body as beautiful as opposed to ugly. Thus, that cannot happen for the Arahant.

    >“But here, Upavāṇa, having seen a form with the eye, a bhikkhu __experiences the form__ without experiencing lust for the form. He understands that lust for forms does not exist internally thus: ‘There is in me no lust for forms internally.’ Since that is so, Upavāṇa, the Dhamma is directly visible, immediate, inviting one to come and see, applicable, to be personally experienced by the wise

    —SN 35.70

    The bodily reaction and pleasant feeling are *part of that form*, on the same "side" where the pheromones are; the feeling is not in "you". The delight and lust that gives rise to the erection is that *internal* side, referring to the citta and its context.

    That pleasant feeling is what needs to be "endured" with right perspective (because it will come up through your thoughts once you start practicing correct sense restraint and stop actually *looking*) of its underlying Dukkha nature until it "sinks in", without denying one bit that on the surface it's very pleasant and falling into aversion (thus losing the "right level"). But the truly worst is *acting out of the pleasure*, not necessarily the inability to practice on the right level right away. Acting out automatically means undoing whatever perspective of its Dukkha nature was there, and re-instating the perversion of context.

    >Perceiving permanence in the impermanent,
    perceiving pleasure in what is suffering,
    perceiving a self in what is non-self,
    and perceiving attractiveness in what is unattractive,
    beings resort to wrong views,
    their minds deranged, their perception twisted.

    >Such people are bound by the yoke of Māra,
    and do not reach security from bondage.
    Beings continue in saṃsāra,
    going to birth and death.

    >But when the Buddhas arise in the world,
    sending forth a brilliant light,
    they reveal this Dhamma that leads
    to the stilling of suffering.

    >Having heard it, wise people
    have regained their sanity.
    They have seen the impermanent as impermanent
    and what is suffering as suffering.

    >They have seen what is non-self
    as non-self and the unattractive as unattractive.
    __By the acquisition of right view,__
    they have overcome all suffering. 

    —AN 4.49

    And it must if course be noted that none of this will be seen for oneself beyond theory unless one gets to understand the "transparency of the mind" that I referred to above, and that's done through the Gradual Training. Without that, "pheromones = erection" will seem the most natural thing in the world.

    So yes, one *has* to be confused if one is still a sensual person, in a way, because that's how Māra/Mother Nature ends up the same way.

        Compare with:

        > “It is wonderful, Master Gotama, it is marvellous how when Master Gotama is spoken to offensively again and again, assailed by discourteous courses of speech, the colour of his skin brightens and the colour of his face clears, as is to be expected of one who is accomplished and fully enlightened. I recall, Master Gotama, engaging Pūraṇa Kassapa in debate, and then he prevaricated, led the talk aside, and showed anger, hate, and bitterness. But when Master Gotama is spoken to offensively again and again, assaulted by discourteous courses of speech, the colour of his skin brightens and the colour of his face clears, as is to be expected of one who is accomplished and fully enlightened.

        It's the same principle. The bodily reaction to insults highlights the dispassion towards the body that doesn't like to be insulted, and that in turn makes the citta be relieved of the burden to the same extent if the body has been fully understood as unownable.

        Focusing practices make you more delicate instead, and require absence of discomfort to succeed. A little sound of traffic or whatever is already too much.

        And since for example monks who practice that also happen to be the sort of people who haven't been spoken harshly to in decades, it's very easy for them to think they're equanimous.

    The point there was not that there is a distinction between two types of craving, but that one needs to know where the craving actually is and its true nature.

    The thing is that, when a puthujjana tries to "look" at craving, they by definition cannot see it. All they see is basically already the *result* of craving being there. 

    So you only get to recognize what craving is and how it's "fueled" by learning to *indirectly* recognize it—meaning it's not an "object" like everything else you're used to—in its nature of something that has nothing to do with your experience in itself but nevertheless depends upon it and is "aimed" at it. That's important because when a puthujjana thinks of craving, ultimately they're bringing to mind an (un)pleasant *feeling* only, unaware of the true craving part. Like how some dedicated meditators would have an aversion to a lot of talking and lively discussions, as that gives rise to a more intense form of __feeling__ than remaining quiet and avoiding people. They would then think that such discussions (about Dhamma of course) are bad and the more silence the better, because talking "*increases their craving*", unable to see that the craving part is gratuitous "on top of" the more intense feeling and does not need to be there. Whenever they "see" feeling, they are unable not to bring the craving along into that picture, and thus the practice and "peace" revolves around just preventing certain feelings (and that can go up to such a subtle level that it would not even be noticeable).

    (Obviously, restraint in regard to speech and noble silence are an integral part of the path. The problem is the *internal* ignorant and unrecognized attitude that feelings that are caused by certain circumstances, which you will inevitably have to experience from time to time, are somehow an issue and obstruction in themselves.)

    
    Through *recognizing* that craving where it is—in your *attitude* towards things as opposed to in things that have arisen on their own, including feelings—you get to see that feelings caused by any circumstance, strong or weak, can be there without any craving present. By not seeing this, affairs of the body—"the pressure" as we call it, which happens "to" the 6 senses and ultimately should never touch the mind—is being conflated with (and thus infused with) craving, hence one does not discern the craving "in the citta" as I put it.

    >And what would be an example or two of things that are rooted in same amount of craving but not fueling it in the mind?

    That would be keeping the precepts, sense restraint, studying the Dhamma, contemplating what you learn, avoiding company and distractions, etc. Basically the Gradual Training. I say that they "don't fuel" the craving instead of saying that they "decrease it" because you can do all that for a million years and not get anywhere if you don't start recognizing that "level" where the craving is, ceasing to confuse it with the pressures and feelings that have nothing to do with you. Also in the sense that simply doing those things, even blindly to some degree, starts to put a lid on the default ways by which one proliferates one's already-rampant confusion of feelings with craving, which happens primarily through the actions of lust, aversion and distraction that adherence to the Gradual Training prevents.

    In the end, that's why an Arahant is indistinguishable from a puthujjana to another puthujjana. It's not that they are always in every situation *doing* something special and different that the rest of the world doesn't do (which is how the ignorant mind expects to recognize who's enlightened), but that *whatever* they do with their body, and every action is a kind of "involvement" with sense-pressure, cannot possibly have craving "in the mind" as its underlying basis.

    And it is because of the lack of that underlying basis that an Arahant cannot do things like have sex. It's not because they are somehow constricting the range of their choices through willpower (which is how the attachment to virtue and practices practically manifests).

### Introduction to Buddhism

Hi all, new to this channel and very grateful for all your input.

Was wondering if you are able to recommend a book or series of essays for a person who is new to Buddhism. 

I feel may be Ajahn Nynamolis books would be too deep in terms of the content for somebody who's starting out?

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/17uyxz6/introduction_to_buddhism/k9acmch/)** _2023-11-15 00:12:31:

    >I feel may be Ajahn Nynamolis books would be too deep in terms of the content for somebody who's starting out?

    Perhaps, if the person is not yet standing at the point where they recognize that there is an inherent problem with their existence that will not by any means be easily solved. It's unbeneficial to "knock on people's door", so to speak, so to offer them deep Dhamma like a Jehovah's Witness.

    If that's the case, you can introduce them to "Buddhism" in a very general sense, but you would also need to understand that their desire to find out what the Buddha actually taught would largely be dependent on the degree to which they feel an urge to solve that "inherent problem" that's too strong to ignore.

    It's fine for the multitude to learn about "general Buddhism", and that's what one may pass on to one's parents, for example (but after trimming away from it many of the modern wrong views, such as that meditation techniques and not wholesome behavior of body, speech and mind are what lead to peace, that if other Buddhists do something it's ok for one to do it too, that we are already enlightened, that laypeople will be spared from suffering if they cultivate craving because they are laypeople, etc.)

    A watered-down version of Buddhism that at least removes these rotten parts will be much better than any other philosophy a person who is not interested in freedom might choose to adhere to.

### You Cannot Get What You Want

I could write disparate argumentative comments about the philosophy of science, epistemology, metaphysics, ethics, and the relationship between all of those things. But these days, I don't see much of a point in existential polemics or evangelism. The only fundamental reason why people don't want to follow the Buddha's teachings in a more authentic and radical way is because they want to indulge in sensuality. Their commitment to scientific metaphysics is only a vehicle for avoiding the possibility of losing out on all the "goodies" that contemporary society provides them if they were to take up ascetic (or not-so-ascetic) religiosity. At first glance, this seems like a reasonably safe play, since the validity of the scientific metaphysic is validated every time they turn on the TV and all other metaphysical systems always seem to hinge on the (assumed) distant epistemic event known as death. (I'm not afraid of death, I just don't want to be there when it happens!)

The problem with this contemporary global ideological default option, hedonistic materialism, is that it simply doesn't work. It never works. It has never worked. The extent to which it works is precisely the extent to which you ignore the fact that it doesn't work. With ignorance, there is craving. With craving, there is suffering.

Let me explain.

I think: I want to touch that butt.

I touch the butt.

Reflection: Wait a minute. That wasn't what I wanted. I wanted to touch the butt that I was thinking about, not the one that I am now touching. One was a thought, an idealization, and the other is a tactile sensation. The butt that I touched and the butt that I thought about touching are *not* the same thing. I wanted the beautiful thing in my head and all I got was this stupid meat sack! This wasn't part of the deal!

Māra: I am altering the deal. Pray I don't alter it any further.

...He always does...but we are back to the butt. Well, at least I have *this* butt and not that lump of dung Ajahn Chah was always going on about...I know! I will change my idea of what I want to perfectly suit that which I now have! And I will pretend to myself that that is what I wanted all along and that there is absolutely no problem here at all! Butts of all kinds are accepted here! Even...this fleshy one that...despite grasping it I cannot...quite...*have* it, pin it down, like I *want*...I keep needing to think about new ways to touch it so that it doesn't get...boring...cause then I would have to *think* about...life...Nope! No problem here! No problem at all! Take that, Māra!

This recognition, the recognition of the futility of any project of attempting to glean satisfaction from the world, is available to anyone and everyone at any time. It is the most immediately available yet utterly terrifying reflection there is. Reflecting deeply in this way, you will no longer care about physics or rebirth or the ethics and epistemology of suicide. You will be met with the emotions that the existential philosophers wrote of. Anxiety. Angst. Vertigo. Nausea. You will come into direct contact with the primordial, groundless horror of your existence. And when you do, you will in that moment be prepared to listen to what the Buddha had to say.

*Suffering and the end of suffering.*

If you reflect in this way often enough, it will become clear that *none* of what is on offer in the mundane world is of *any* value. And so long as you do not give in to the temptation of suicide or a descent into insanity, so long as a Buddha has arisen in the world and made clear the resolution to the problem which you still only have an unclear but deeply pressing awareness of, you *will* eventually arrive at the Dhamma. There is no other possibility. This is the final destination, the end of the road, where radicals with nothing to lose may dig their teeth into something that is at least not completely speculative or completely nauseating.

Life is too short for metaphysics. Seek the Dhamma as if you have nothing to lose. Because, in truth, you don't.

### question for Bhikkhu Anigha (extracted from another conversation)

is the samadhi of the layman (based on sila, etc) considered 'sammasamadhi?' I know (from SN55.25-Sarakani Sutta) that a dhamma follower or faith follower possesses the faculty of samadhi (as well as the rest of the five facilities) without being a sotapanna. I guess I'd ask the same about their sati, panna, etc.

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/17udn4g/question_for_bhikkhu_anigha_extracted_from/k94qy5p/)** _2023-11-13 22:31:18:

    >is the samadhi of the layman (based on sila, etc) considered 'sammasamadhi?' I know (from SN55.25-Sarakani Sutta) that a dhamma follower or faith follower possesses the faculty of samadhi (as well as the rest of the five facilities) without being a sotapanna. 

    Good to bring this up. This actually proves further some of our oft-repeated statements of how people should not consider themselves to be practicing the Dhamma or having the five faculties yet in order to start off on the right foot towards actually acquiring them (they are absent in the puthujjana as per SN 48.15 and all the Suttas in that series, as well as others elsewhere). 

    The most comprehensive description or what the faith- and Dhamma follower are is the entire SN 25. 

    >Sāvatthī. “Bhikkhus, the eye is impermanent, changing, becoming otherwise. The ear … The nose … The tongue … The body … The mind is impermanent, changing, becoming otherwise. __One who places faith in these teachings and resolves on them__ thus is called a faith-follower, one who has entered the fixed course of rightness, __entered the plane of superior persons (ariyabhūmi), transcended the plane of the worldlings (puthujjanabhūmi).__ He is incapable of doing any deed by reason of which he might be reborn in hell, in the animal realm, or in the domain of ghosts; __he is incapable of passing away without having realized the fruit of stream-entry.__

    
    >“One for whom these teachings are accepted thus after being pondered to a sufficient degree with wisdom is called a Dhamma-follower,one who has entered the fixed course of rightness, entered the plane of superior persons, transcended the plane of the worldlings. He is incapable of doing any deed by reason of which he might be reborn in hell, in the animal realm, or in the domain of ghosts; he is incapable of passing away without having realized the fruit of stream-entry. 

    >“One who knows and sees these teachings thus is called a stream-enterer, no longer bound to the nether world, fixed in destiny, with enlightenment as his destination.” 

    ―SN 25.1 [one of these two is what Sarakani himself was; *technically* he had sotapatti-path, not sotapatti-fruit]. 

    What follows from this is that, unless a person is willing to declare themselves to be permanently free from the lowers realms and belong to the plane of ariyas, one cannot even assume oneself to have "placed faith in these teachings and resolved on them". That will have to be either because one doesn't know where to look when the Buddha says "__the eye__ is..." (or any of the other phenomena mentioned in the other 9 suttas of this Samyutta) or because one has not sufficiently clarified what "is impermanent, becoming otherwise" and so on means, and one possibly takes it to be some sort of "constant flux" of particles or lack of __*"Real Substance"*__ in things. 

    The first shortcoming is resolved by learning to grasp the hints of the mind, which requires non-delight in company (AN 6.68) and of course virtue and sense restraint without which true seclusion is not possible, hence it always comes *later* in the Gradual Training (see the post "signs of the mind" on the sub). 

    As I've been mentioning a lot recently, people in the Buddha's time obviously didn't have to go through this first step, but that's because they already recognized the hints of their mind naturally more than the average person today (how many people nowadays would listen to a Dhamma talk like [this](https://suttacentral.net/mn54/en/bodhi?lang=en) and react to it in the way Potaliya did, considering he seems not to actually have become a sotapanna but simply an ordinary follower? Most would start immediately grasping at straws to find fault with what the Buddha is saying). 

    The second shortcoming is overcome by striving to abandon wrong views and cultivating right views, and that is done by reading the Suttas carefully and honestly and studying Dhamma materials that do not contradict them. 

    As to the samādhi, sati and paññā of such a person, it's not at all that they're doing some sort of "method" to see that for example the eye is impermanent, and to purify their minds from obstructions by contemplating that (which they can do, and that's their samādhi; the "method" part is what is gratuitous). As it says, they simply either *have faith* in that or have pondered accurately on its meaning, and they would be able to recognize it on the most general level of their existence, not just when they're sitting quietly cross legged or been on retreat for a while (which they might even not be able to do if they're busy householders as many were, including kings and extremely wealthy people). 

    This makes it sound like anyone can become one of these two followers and that it's too easy, but the real takeaway here is that even faith in the Dhamma and an truly accurate understanding resulting from pondering on it are *__way__* harder to achieve than people realize.

    How are we sure that what you are referring to here as "foundational reality" *really* is foundational reality and not just another elaborate construct?

    >Is lay followers who only follow based on faith still will be guaranteed stream entry?

    Yes. But the point I made is that both faith and intellectual understanding are incredibly more difficult to acquire than what people assume. It's not about "agreeing" with what the teacher or the Buddha tells you for example. You need to *understand it* already to some degree (though a bit less than the dhamma-follower) in order for your faith to be properly directed.

    If you don't understand what "the eye is impermanent" is even referring to, you can't possibly have faith in it.  

    Since it *absolutely guarantees* one to eventually become an Arahant within 7 existences at most, there is nothing harder in this universe than putting faith in the view that the eye is impermanent (or any of  the other ways of phrasing the insight all throughout SN 25). The journey towards Arahantship becomes like that of a ship naturally being pushed by the wind in the right direction once you "just" put faith in that.

    >“Just as that tender calf just born, being urged on by its mother’s lowing, also breasted the stream of the Ganges and got safely across to the further shore, so too, those bhikkhus who are Dhamma-followers and faith-followers—by breasting Māra’s stream they too will get safely across to the further shore.

    >“Bhikkhus, I am skilled in this world and in the other world, skilled in Māra’s realm and in what is outside Māra’s realm, skilled in the realm of Death and in what is outside the realm of Death. It will lead to the welfare and happiness for a long time of those who think they should listen to me and place faith in me.”

    I made the same point in one comment sometime this week.

    Since this has escalated to the point of being barely on topic, it would be good if you could find a way to formulate your doubts and post it on the newest thread I made. This is a dilemma which many people who approach the Dhamma may face so I'd like to address it.

    [This talk](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=hB9dQFtXMKs) is one example.

    Although, don't put *too much* emphasis on trying to "wrap your head around it" right away, and instead, as I wrote, recognize that sense restraint is what begins to reveal to you what "the eye" even is.

    Otherwise, when you think about "the eye" you will be thinking about *an object*, even if the definition of that object you are using is utterly and perfectly in accordance with the Suttas or very accurate phenomenology. Only actual sense restraint and not acting out is what starts to reveal to you that there is something in your experience that is *not* an object, and yet it's very much there, meaning your sense organs that perceive pleasure and pain. You will never be able to "grab" your sense organs in the same way you can "grab" objects with your intellect, so to speak. But your discernment cultivated on the basis of Gradual Training would get to know their presence and their nature.

    The fact that it's not being seen on the "right level" is what prevents one from at least putting faith in it and becoming a faith-follower. It's not primarily the fact that one didn't hear the right instruction (not nowadays, at least).

    You can also think of impermanence of the eye not just as the fact that the matter of your body will disintegrate (which is true), but also the fact that what the eye likes or dislikes is always changeabe and never says the same, and you are not the one deciding its desires, so to speak, nor how long they stay.

    That's how you get to see that having senses is in and of itself dukkha, and that's already the Four Noble Truths.

    >"cetanāhaṃ, bhikkhave, kammaṃ vadāmi" 

    What's important to remember here is that the Pali Suttas are not giving us a perfectly consistent network of terms and definitions, and some words are sometimes used broadly and loosely.

    Here, the word "cetanā" is referring to what we now in our elucidation of the Suttas would call *"intentional intention"*, meaning that when a possibility to do something offers itself, __you__ choose to go for it.

    That is your kamma, and understanding that principle and ceasing to fuel it is how you free yourself from kamma as well. An Arahant still has intentional intentions, but they are free from kamma because there is no craving behind those, meaning that their mind would not give rise to any states of lust, aversion or delusion if they were to refrain from making the choice out of the arisen possibility. 

    This is why they are incapable of breaking the five precepts for example, since those actions would always be rooted in not being able to put up with the arisen unskillful possibility and needing to go with the grain of it instead.

        Regarding this:

        >What's important to remember here is that the Pali Suttas are not giving us a perfectly consistent network of terms and definitions, and some words are sometimes used broadly and loosely.

        That doesn't mean that the Suttas are not consistent enough so that for every proposed argument X that the Buddha would not agree with, there would not be a corresponding Sutta Y that disproves it in a way that is unambiguous and does not depend on those terms that are loosely used (like viññāna or saññā at times too). 

        And often the tenuous and unjustifiable arguments that are made based on (or I should say *in spite of*) the Suttas rely on such loosely used terms.

    >In practical terms, thoughts seem to come to me in two flavors. __The first involves intentional thoughts that needs fueling and active participation, such as engaging in internal dialogue. The second encompasses spontaneous thoughts and images that seem to arise unexpectedly.__ When it comes to purposeful self-dialogue, conversations stemming from a wholesome state of mind, like genuine contemplation, are encouraged, whereas engaging in self-talk driven by an unwholesome state of mind is advised against. As for random thoughts, since they are beyond our control, neither acceptance nor rejection is appropriate; rather, they should be endured. Bhante, am I understanding this correctly? Additionally, what is mental kamma in practical terms?

    You can forget about "classifying" types of thoughts altogether. __Absolutely Everything__ that is either remaining the same or changing in your experience for as long as you are not engaging in unwholesome with your body and are not speaking, and for as long as you're not in the second jhāna, is the vitakkavicāra discussed in the Suttas (reaching and cultivating that recognition is how you enter the first jhāna by the way, the cessation of speech, and thus __"transcend the All"__ also described in the Suttas. Trying to have only one "type" of thought as opposed to another is not part of that development at any point. MN 19 is not talking about "types of objects" but about the two classes of *context* that you can have in regard to objects. Virtue, celibacy, restraint, seclusion, not speaking and right context are the only components of the development of jhāna.)

    It would be particularly good to not think in terms of the part that I highlighted, which is a common view, and think in terms of only mental kamma, not *what* that kamma happens in regard to.

    Mental kamma can only be understood *after* your bodily and verbal kamma have been tamed. Otherwise you will be mixing up the three domains without noticing. 

    Not acting out by body and speech in any way out of lust and aversion is what starts pointing you in the direction of what kamma actually is: it's not when the pressure to do or say *arises*, but when you give in to it. '

    One can understand that in theory but unless one's restraint has been developed, it will be just that: theory which, when practicing according to it, may or may not give rise to meditation experiences that are not ultimately relevant to understanding the 3 domains of action and freeing oneself from suffering.

    So through developing the principle in body and speech, you eventually get to see what is the "line" where the mere arising of a thought becomes a mental action. It has nothing to do with the *content* of that thought, although of course, there are very coarse cases where even as an ordinary person one will be aware that one is delighting or hating something. 

    Before developing on those two levels, this is what will happen: you will start thinking that *types* of thoughts are the problem, because you still also think that *types* of deeds and words are the issue, and have yet to recognize that it's the *pressure behind* the deeds and words that make them unwholesome (and that pressure would always __have to__ be given into in order to break the five precepts with celibacy as the fifth).

    I believe I addressed this with different words in the essay.

### Review of "The Jhānas and the Lay Disciple According to the Pāli Suttas"

Yesterday I came across an article by Ven. Bhikkhu Bodhi titled ["The Jhānas and the Lay Disciple According to the Pāli Suttas"](https://www.budsas.org/ebud/ebdha267.htm), which happens to accurately disprove the contemporary idea that the jhānas are indispensable for stream-entry, and should also make lay followers of this day and age who think of themselves as jhāna-attainers seriously re-consider whether they are right in assuming themselves to be capable of a superhuman attainment that the *enlightened* lay followers, who had been receiving direct instruction from the Buddha for many years in his time [were not capable of](https://suttacentral.net/mn14/en/sujato) (the point is implied throughout the article as well, not just in this Sutta).

It seems the author does not realize this, but his conclusions also implicitly add weight to the argument that samādhi is not "concentration" on an object. This is because the recollections of the Triple Gem, virtue and generosity, the "pleasant abidings here and now"―a term for samādhi―cannot be taken as "objects" to give one's fixed attention to in any meaningful way. 

We have [in the past](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Xor6zqSrdG4) spoken about how the recollection of the Triple Gem is a form of "pleasant abiding here and now" that would be accessible to a noble lay disciple who has gained unshakable confidence in the Buddha's teaching (stream entry), and that the jhānas require a higher degree of restraint, specifically celibacy. This is further supported by the article, which proves the point that sammāsamādhi is not limited to the four jhānas, despite them usually making up the factor of samādhi in the Noble Eightfold Path. This fits perfectly with [AN 6.73](https://suttacentral.net/an6.73/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin) that we often quote: attaining those 4 establishments of mind is impossible for one who has not fully discerned the danger in sensual pleasures, which would necessarily be the case for whoever continues to partake in them on the coarsest level of sexual intercourse. 

There exists a custom of using either "buddho", "dhammo" or "saṅgho" as individual "mantras" in the name of recollection of the Triple Gem, but hopefully, no one who has studied the suttas would claim that the world fails to realize [the Deathless](https://suttacentral.net/an9.47/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin) owing to a failure to perform this mechanical, mental repetition of a mere sound properly. 

The word translated as "recollection" in this case is just the word "sati" with the prefix "anu", so, to argue based on logic alone, whatever can be called a "recollection" should be very close in its manner of practice to what "anapana-*sati*" is. It would be ludicrous to suggest that the theme of one's practice of samādhi would completely change how it is developed, and __what it even is__. 

The contemporary "breath observation" and the associated techniques used to aid it such as "counting"— and just the general idea that sati of the breath is to be centered around the awareness of body parts and sensations—form a completely different approach to practice than what would be done by recollecting, for instance, your conviction in the righteousness of the noble saṅgha, or the qualities of the Dhamma being "well taught, visible here and now, timeless, etc.". Such direct-attention and sensation-observation  practices not taught in the Suttas— unlike this recollection of the Triple Gem, or the *understanding* of the breath that is the authentic ānāpānasati ("breathing in long, he *understands* (pajānāti :: paññā) [the action of] breathing in long" —Ānāpānasatisutta)—result in an entirely different mental state.

This is a fundamental crossroads, as these two forms of practice are so divergent that only one of them can be "sammāsati"—and only one claims support from the Suttas. The fact alone that both result in feelings of pleasure is a very tenuous link. Yet the most important consequence of following either is the radically different sort of "knowledge and vision" that will be attained. As the Buddha [makes sure to tell us](https://suttacentral.net/an10.103/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin), incorrect samādhi *does* result in knowledge, and even in a type of "liberation". 

As evidenced by [AN 10.106](https://suttacentral.net/an10.106/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin), the liberation that is not of the right kind leads to unskilful states. Here it must be kept in mind the fact that "liberation" is by definition always *pleasant* and *unburdening*, and frees one from one's issues (or at least so it will seem). Also, the previous factor of "knowledge" resulting in "liberation" will always by nature appear as enlightening and earth-shattering when it arises. This danger is made worse by the fact that the ordinary person [does not see unskilful as unskilful](https://suttacentral.net/MN9/en/sujato), and is said throughout the texts to be "untrained and unseeing of the noble Dhamma", which of course includes sammāsamādhi.

Finally, it should be clear that we would, of course, choose to disagree every single time the word "concentration" as a translation for samādhi occurs in the article, and with commentarial notions such as "mundane jhānas",  "access concentration", and Visuddhimagga-biased, etymologically unjustifiable renderings such as "one-pointedness". Apart from this, the author's conclusions, someone whom we can at least give due credit for having studied the Suttas more than nearly anyone else on the planet, are mostly solid and well-supported. 

On nearly all other instances apart from this paper we would disagree with the author, including even the footnotes on his translations of the Nikāyas, and his renderings of many crucial terms in the translations themselves, where he sides with modern/commentarial interpretations. 

Notable excerpts: 

>•__The texts sometimes speak of the worldling jhāna-attainer as "an outsider devoid of lust for sensual pleasures."__ [This connects with what I've alluded to in my latest essay and Dhamma talk: that one who learns to abide in and develop the jhānas taught in the Suttas would *have to* become free from sensuality, *even* without noble attainments].


>•"What is noteworthy about this list is that samādhi, as a faculty, does not determine a class of its own until after the fruit of stream-entry has been realized. That is, facility in [composure] determines a distinct type of disciple among the arahants (as the both-ways-liberated arahant) and among the aspirants for the higher stages (as the body-witness), but not among the aspirants for stream-entry. In this lowest category we have only the faith-follower and the Dhamma-follower, who owe their status to faith and wisdom, respectively, but there is no type corresponding to the body-witness." 

>•[...] the thesis that jhāna is necessary at every stage of enlightenment claims powerful support from the canonical account of the Noble Eightfold Path, which defines the path factor of right [composure] (sammā samādhi) with the stock formula for the four jhānas. From this definition, it might be argued that [...] the jhānas are indispensable from the first stage of awakening to the last. 
This conclusion, however, does not necessarily follow. [...] It could be that attainment of jhāna is necessary to complete the development of the path, becoming mandatory at a relatively late point in the disciple's progress." 

>•...since the passage simply inserts the formula for the four jhānas without qualification into the definition of the [composure] faculty, we would have to conclude that all noble disciples, monks, and lay followers alike, possess all four jhānas, not just one. Even more, they would have to possess the four jhānas already as faith-followers and Dhamma-followers, at the very entry to the path. This, however, seems too generous, and indicates that we need to be cautious in interpreting such formulaic definitions. 

>•At AN 5:179/III 211, the Buddha speaks, with reference to "a lay follower clothed in white" (gihī odātavasana), of four "pleasant dwellings in this very life pertaining to the higher mind" (cattāro ābhicetasikā diṭṭhadhamma-sukhavihārā). Now in relation to monks, the Nikāyas invariably use this expression to mean the four jhānas.[25] If it were considered commonplace, or even paradigmatic, for a lay noble disciple to attain the four jhānas, one would expect the Buddha to explain the above expression in the same way as he does for monks. But he does not.

    I did read it a few months ago, and Ajahn Nyanamoli had come across it too. I was somewhat surprised to find it.

    The book does serve as real life evidence of the argument I made in my newest essay that if one were to do an honest and careful reading of the Suttas, one would simply not end up holding the widespread views of today. Most of those ideas would simply not arise, given that they already entail believing that experience works in a way that it actually doesn't, which even the most un-Buddhist person who is not already invested in those views (or in the misapplication of science to "explain" consciousness) would be able to recognize. 

    The main issue we would take with it is that (as far as I remember), despite the accuracy of the majority of the points that are made, especially when it comes to just interpreting the Pāli terms and such, the actual *practice* that leads to jhāna was never addressed. In an ideal world where everyone knows what "being fully separated from sensual pleasures" (vivicceva kāmehi) truly means, this would not be a problem, as they would know that there is only one way to reach that: *actually* being incapable of sensual desire, which requires complete dispassion towards sensual pleasures and seeing them as a "charcoal pit", so that there is no underlying desire and infatuation towards them.

    >“And how, bhikkhus, are sensual pleasures seen by a bhikkhu in such a way that as he looks at them __sensual desire, sensual affection, sensual infatuation, and sensual passion do not lie latent within him in regard to sensual pleasures? [=the hindrance of sensuality is absent]?__

    >Suppose there is a charcoal pit deeper than a man’s height, filled with glowing coals without flame or smoke. A man would come along wanting to live, not wanting to die, desiring happiness and averse to suffering. Then two strong men would grab him by both arms and drag him towards the charcoal pit. The man would wriggle his body this way and that. For what reason? Because he knows: __‘I will fall into this charcoal pit and I will thereby meet death or deadly suffering.’__ So too, bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu has seen sensual pleasures as similar to a charcoal pit, sensual desire, sensual affection, sensual infatuation, and sensual passion do not lie latent within him in regard to sensual pleasures.

    ―SN 35.244

    (I also cited many other Suttas in my essay which describe how the hindrances are overcome through contemplating the peril of sensuality.)

    
    Since this is not addressed, the book will indirectly instill the notion in most readers who agree with it that what it takes to achieve jhāna is simply a less focused kind of awareness, an "open awareness" if you will, as it's sometimes called. And this is insufficient to truly surmount the five hindrances, despite the fact that it may give rise to pleasant experiences and be only slightly less outrageous than the attempt to be aware of one thing alone.

    Fundamentally, the first jhāna is a state of complete dispassion, disenchantment and lack of interest towards the entire world, compared in [this series of Suttas](https://suttacentral.net/an9.47/en/sujato?lang=en) to none other than Nibbāna itself ("in a provisional sense", as they make sure to note). It is not enough to find a form of happiness that does not depend on the physical world nor on concentrating on an object to enter jhāna. The book focuses more on defining what the pleasure of jhāna is, and does not go into the [torment and misery](https://suttacentral.net/mn54/en/bodhi?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin) that need to be understood and abandoned to as to enter it. Accomplishing the latter would result in jhāna whether you like it or not; getting a PhD in the former would not bring you much closer.

    We usually speak against focusing meditation techniques most often since those are the most popular ones, but fundamentally, "opening" the range of your awareness is not the gateway to the Buddha's Teaching either.

    We'd also heavily disagree with the following sort of statement:

    >With better understanding of the first and second jhāna, meditators who supposedly don’t practise “jhāna” may suddenly realise that actually, going by the Suttas’ terminology, they’ve already done it, and that the jhānas aren’t as inaccessible as they were led to believe. 

    Which is tantamount to claiming that a large amount of ordinary people have experienced "Nibbāna in a provisional sense", referring back to AN 9.47 that I quoted above. Surely there are practitioners who are delighted by this idea, but whoever is honest about their predicament and lack of knowledge of the way out of suffering will realize that this is too good to be true.

    Last but certainly not least, something that, to heavily understate, is not unrelated to what I wrote above regarding the necessity of dispassion to achieve true jhāna: it makes no mention (AFAIK) of the fact that one's actions rooted in sensual desire are the foremost obstacle to achieving the pleasure apart from the sensual domain, and of the necessity of celibacy and sense restraint, which in fact is said to in and of itself lead to the wholesome sort of pleasure in [some Suttas](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.94/en/sujato?lang=en) when done properly, i.e., by one who sees the [hints of their mind](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/15y7cz5/signs_of_the_mind/), be it a stream enterer or the potentially-not-found-among-earth's-current-population person who has such little dust in their eyes that they can enter jhāna __("provisional Nibbāna and Deathless")__ without having heard the Buddha's teaching. It also does not emphasize the [need for physical seclusion and not delighting in company](https://suttacentral.net/an6.68/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin) that is necessary to see the hints of one's mind, which is what [enables](https://suttacentral.net/sn47.8/en/sujato) the proper contemplation (jhāna) of the danger in sensual pleasures or any other satipaṭṭhāna. 

    The choice to give up the emphasis on attention to objects is a prerequisite to embarking in the direction of that proper contemplation, but is ultimately insufficient.

    >The five hindrances, too, I say, have a nutriment; they are not without nutriment. And what is the nutriment for the five hindrances? It should be said: the three kinds of misconduct. The three kinds of misconduct, too, I say, have a nutriment; they are not without nutriment. And what is the nutriment for the three kinds of misconduct? It should be said: non-restraint of the sense faculties. 

    ―AN 10.61

    >The celibacy part is simple. Sexuality is absent in the Brahma Worlds, so inorder to temporary occupy those headspaces the person must themselves be abesnt of sexuality within their human headspace. Physical restraint alone is completely insufficient. 

    Very good point. The "headspace" cannot possibly be emptied of sexuality through a merely temporary commitment to celibacy, let alone no commitment at all.

    >just because it's not the '1 in a billion can do it' absorption jhana doesn't mean it's easy to achieve

    Yes, I remember it mentioning the "jhāna is nearly impossible" thing that is from the commentaries (and although the modern quest towards "absorption" stems from that which the commentaries describe as jhāna and is supposedly hardly achievable, people seem to be getting those jhānas left and right—or perhaps that's because they lowered their standards so as to no longer live up to the source of the whole idea, being often unaware that that's basically where it comes from).

    Also, I would actually not hesitate to use the expression "'1 in a billion (today) can do it' dispassion jhāna". But that's not because there are some intrinsic obstacles related to people's faculties or past kamma, as with the commentarial ultimate, perfect absorption made up of "mind moments" all exclusively consisting of the "object" (hard to say why this deserves be called "jhāna", as in comprehension/meditation in the original meaning of the word).

    The funny thing is, that "dispassion jhāna" can be achieved by almost anyone. The real obstacle is that, in the process of moving in that direction, there is a (most likely strategically designed by a certain being) minefield that all but the most dedicated and discerning practitioners will be able to not prematurely perish in during the process of treading it (beginning with the several-square-kilometers-large, nuclear land mine of non-celibacy). And it's not unreasonable to say that there was a lot more safe space to walk on between the mines back in the Buddha's day, with less proliferation of views—to the point where someone who *knew* that absence of sensual desire was the main prerequisite for jhāna likely wouldn't have strayed too far from it.

    People like the wanderer in MN 80—whose idea of what one is supposed to be aware of during meditation is in some ways not too dissimilar to many contemporary notions), or the one in MN 75 with a wrong view of what "Nibbāna" is—tended to hold think that way because they had *factually* not heard the Buddha's teaching, not because they heard it and then chose to water it down, or to do something else altogether.

    
    (Another interesting find: regarding the word ["meditation"] (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditation), see what the few introductory paragraphs describe, and compare that with the "Etymology" section).

    "Hypnosis" (intentional, to boot) is certainly accurate.

    Although generally, I would avoid presenting a contrasting idea of what is kusala compared to what is akusala that people can too easily relate to and think that they "got it" by just figuring it out and changing their opinion.

    >I hope and believe there are more than 8 people practicing jhana today,

    There's no *intrinsic* reason why that could not be the case. Hopefully, my statement is just due to the fact that these people don't teach, are hardly known, don't speak English, or I the fact that I haven't (and never will have) deep searched the Internet that I can't seem to find a living person who *elucidates further* without contradictions the practice of jhāna taught in the Suttas, as opposed to "moving the goalposts", fabricating something else altogether out of thin air, or failing to emphasize what the needs to be understood and abandoned so as to enter jhāna.

    Ajahn Chah was such a person, but unfortunately, his instructions on anapanasati, presented by him often as a central practice for beginners as opposed to for much later on (as the Buddha did with Rahula in MN 62) were not catered to the average person and he was not putting himself in their shoes (obviously not on purpose), since it is only for a mind that is already significantly free that the recognition of the context of breathing can lead beyond thinking and pondering effortlessly, without having to "endure" the pressure of thoughts as we often talk about, which is the principle that cultivates the first jhāna (although he did make it clear that the first jhāna consists of something that __is__ "thinking and pondering", not just "directed thought and evaluation", "applied and sustained attention" or "placing the mind and keeping it connected" or similar). 

    A person who is not free from sensuality would, in their misguided attempt to follow those instructions that are coming from real wisdom, mistakenly try to overcome the hindrances by *getting rid* of thinking and pondering, and this results in neither the first jhāna nor the second (AN 9.35, where you can incidentally see an example of Bhikkhu Bodhi's mistranslations: "vHe does not pursue that __object__, does not develop and cultivate it, does not __focus on it__ well". That's not even close to what the Pāli says.

    *[Also, note that this is already an infinitely better scenario compared to the bhikkhu who doesn't reach the first jhāna with thinking and pondering at all, but something else instead].*

    In many places, Ajahn Chah also made clear that trying to stop the mind from thinking is not the goal, but rather developing the right kind of thinking based on dispassion. I am also left wondering how many times he must have given instructions more along these lines which flew over the head of his students, or their minds "subconsciously" chose to not pay due attention to due to being already pleased with their (mis)understanding of his anapanasati instructions. The ones that did make it through to us today do not tend to be quoted from as far as I've seen, or are at least relegated to comparatively secondary importance, such as when you *can't* focus on the one object well enough so *then* "it's fine" to do some wholesome thinking).

    He was also quite insistent on the lack of benefit in sensuality and worldly pleasures, and often made strong statements (which may be taken as mere poetry by some) like that one should be willing to put one's life on the line so as to abandon those things.

    So yes, I suppose it is possible that there are Ajahn Chah disciples who, referring back to the first paragraph here, may be able to enter jhāna and more without having "moved the goalposts" of what that even is―that he may have been able to pass on the actual practice of pleasant dispassion to *some* of his Thai students, but they don't seem to be the ones who have become well-known as far as I've seen.

    His respected disciples often blatantly contradict his very statements, often with the underlying but unstated view that Ajahn Chah was some sort of Zen-esque teacher, whose actual message should (conveniently) not be expected to lie in his words and be logically consistent from one Dhamma talk to another. The consequence of this being that it's perfectly fine to interpret his teachings in the most flambuoyant ways, cherry-picking quotes and overlooking the times that he made statements that clearly contradict what they, after his passing, can now present as his legacy without reproach. And since the original Thai recordings are not public, there is little opportunity to disprove with evidence their chosen interpretations of his ideas. And of course, it's clear that the written translations have been "polished", to say the least.

    Edit: you're right, it would be better to make a new thread for that question. I'll post my reply there when it's up. Also, I'll just mention that I have no "horse in the race" regarding Ajahn Chah. My ordination is Sri Lankan and I've never been to Thailand or any of the branch monasteries. I'm actually not a fan of the tradition in general.

    I also became aware of Sayadaw U Tejaniya through this book. He makes some good points about focusing practices and how awareness works. However, I find that his instructions still do not address the main obstacle that's preventing an ordinary person from removing from their mind that which is the foremost disturbance according to the Suttas. Even if technically his ideas about awareness and phenomenological experience are not inaccurate. The existential phenomenologists also managed to form very accurate views about how consciousness works for example, to the point where, having hardly spent time with their works at all as part of my practice, I was surprised by the acuity of their phenomenological recognitions― especially Sartre whose Being and Nothingness I read a few pages from recently.

    >it was what finally took me out of mainstream meditation methods and theories and gave me the first nudge in the right direction.

    I supposed it'd be a better starting point for most people indeed, leaving less to "unlearn".

    
    >talking about potential aspects of experience that one can naturally become aware of [...] this "shift" is _not an object_ in the sense in which objects are used in mainstream meditation practice -- as something put in front. it is something that can only be noticed _reflectively_, as the background of whatever is currently in front -- the room one is in, for example, in the case she was mentioning. so just that was enough for me to start groping my way towards the background.

    Yes, this is the sort of thing the phenomenologists would be describing. The funny thing is it's kind of obvious the way that experience works. It doesn't take much to recognize it―what takes a lot of work today is un-recognizing one's even "wronger than wrong" conceivings of it.

    >once their presence is acknowledged, practice becomes mostly about keeping an eye open for their presence, and learning to contain them -- not acting out of them which, from Tejaniya's perspective, is a mental acting out first, so the way he talks about it is about not letting greed, aversion, and delusion leak into the attitude one is carrying around both while sitting and in one s daily life. background sensitivity intermingled with letting awareness be aware of what it is already aware -- and not denying that it is aware of what it is aware.

    That may help people manage their issues *way* better than the usual "stress therapy meditation" or whatever that is commonplace today, done with the usual object focusing and sensation watching. So  what U Tejaniya teaches should be secularized and sold to the masses if you were to ask me. However, when it comes to suffering and  freedom from it, it would also introduce a contradiction with the following:

    >“When, friends, a noble disciple understands the unwholesome and the root of the unwholesome, the wholesome and the root of the wholesome,  in that way he is one of right view, whose view is straight, who has unwavering confidence in the Dhamma and has arrived at this true Dhamma.

    [...]

    >"And what is the root of the unwholesome? Greed is a root of the unwholesome; hate is a root of the unwholesome; delusion is a root of the unwholesome. This is called the root of the unwholesome."
     
    ―MN 9

    And also this:

    >“Bhikkhus, there are these two powers. What two? The power of reflection and the power of development.
    “And what is the power of reflection? Here, someone reflects thus: ‘Bodily... verbal...mental misconduct has a bad result in the present life and in the future life.’ Having reflected thus, he abandons bodily... verbal... mental misconduct and takes on good bodily... verbal... mental conduct; he maintains himself in purity. This is called the power of reflection.

    >“And what is the power of development? The power of development is the power of trainees. __For relying on the power of a trainee [see SN 48.12 below], one abandons lust, hatred, and delusion.__ Having abandoned lust, hatred, and delusion, one does not do anything unwholesome; one does not pursue anything bad. This is called the power of development.
    “These, bhikkhus, are the two powers.”
    ―AN 2.11

    And "trainee" (sekha) always means one of the first 7 noble individuals in the Suttas. 

    So teaching in that way will unfortunately tend to lead people not to question far and deeply enough what is truly preventing them from becoming a trainee, since implicitly they will be assuming they already are one (even if they know they are not ariyas, the implication is they *can* accurately see akusala as akusala―what greed, aversion and delusion are―and that's what a sekha is).

    >for me, when i first got exposed to this, it was as if a whole new world was opened up -- and "practice" became inseparable from "life" -- as it became about _revealing_ what is already there, implicitly, and understanding it. 

    Yes, that is one advantage. Again, just like with the existential phenomenologists.

    >a first hand, hands on investigation of how my mind is when it is on hindrances -- not with the intention of getting rid of them, but of containing them -- while, in parallel, __cultivating the five spiritual powers.__

    That is indeed more in the right direction of where to look to see the hindrances, but there would be a similar issue with it:

    >"“Bhikkhus, there are these five faculties. What five? The faculties of conviction, effort, recollection, composure and discernment. These are the five faculties.

    >Someone who has completed and fulfilled these five faculties is an Arahant. If they are weaker than that, they’re a non-returner. If they are weaker still, they’re a once-returner. If they are weaker still, they’re a stream-enterer. If they’re weaker still, they’re a follower of teachings. If they’re weaker still, they’re a follower by faith.”
    ―SN 48.12

    There's also MN 2 showing that both abandonment of unwholesome and cultivation of wholesome ("bhāvanā) requires yoniso manasikāra to have been understood and developed, and that this would lead to stream entry, after which each one of the 6 subsequent components of practice are possible, since they mention "having reflected according to the womb" as prerequisite (outrageously rendered as "reflecting rationally" if you look at the SC translation). Same with SN 46.30 showing that Ven. Udayi gained the 7 enlightenment factors, effectively synonymous with the five powers, as a *result* of stream-entry, rather than those  7 factors making up his *practice towards it.* And it's just a general point that when there is non-knowledge of the Four Noble Truths, i.e. wrong view or micchādiṭṭhi, other things like right effort and recollection cannot be present. As AN 10.103 puts it, the first factor sort of "snowballs" into the subsequent others, culminating even in "wrong liberation" in SN 45.26. It's a bit of tragicomedy to note the mention of "worse than the inferior person", and the two factors that make them be so.

    Furthermore, in AN 6.55, where the advice to "balance the faculties" occurs, there is very good reason to believe that Ven. Soṇa was already a sekha. There is no way that an ordinary person can do much, let alone tread the path to Arahantship as he did through on account of such a terse utterance.

    
    SN 54.12 also shows us that the Buddha generally did not distinguish, or did not find it necessary to mention a category of person lower than a sekha, meaning an ordinary person, who was able to abandon the five hindrances. This was the case obviously for people like the Buddha's former teachers, but apart from them, if we take the canonical narrative at face value, there did not seem to be anybody else that he felt was particularly well-equipped to hear his teaching after his enlightenment, i.e. people who were skilled at abandoning hindrances. To paraphrase AN 9.47 which I quoted somewhere in this thread, a taste of abandoning hindrances is a taste of Nibbāna, and there is therefore not much barring a person who achieved the former from the latter.

    >as it still carries some misleading traditional baggage.

    One of the main things I would point out in that context is the general idea (which can be ascribed to the Burmese AFAIK, or at least was brought by them to the modern Zeitgeist) that meditation can be successfully performed if one simply receives an accurate set of instructions from a teacher and carries them out to the best of one's ability. U Tejaniya seems to be operating within this assumption, contrary to the idea that the Suttas I quoted are putting forth.

    That's why I mentioned some time ago in one reply that if a teacher were to relentlessly emphasize abandonment of sensuality *without* resorting to the usual focusing techniques so as to *stop perceiving* the domain of the five senses, they would be much closer to the Suttas and what we are teaching, than someone who is able to give accurate descriptions of the workings of awareness but does not emphasize the putting down of the heaviest of all internal burdens (sensual desire) so as to acheive (temporary and eventually permanent) calm. All these intricate descriptions we give of "foreground vs background", "peripheral", "context", etc. are all necessary only because if they are not mentioned, a person today will most likely be *actively* going too far in the opposite direction.

    Also, this is why abandoning sensuality merely through one's body and speech results in a better and happier life in and of itself, regardless of one's ideas about how and to what extent attention should be directed towards phenomena. It's because that what matters, and the "mental purity" can only be achieved by taking that same principle of non-sensuality in the first two doors of action further into the third.

    Nevertheless, I will say that I never expected to hear a Burmese monk encouraging anything other than Visuddhimagga-like focusing, and when I saw the word "Sayadaw", I was not far from not looking the name up at all, so it was an interesting find anyway.

    >it actually seems to start momentary and then with practice become sustained over a longer period.

    Correct, it starts momentary in the sense that right effort and right recollection of the context can only be established "for a fingersnap", and by sustaining it long enough, the citta becomes so that *it* sustains the context now, without the need for one's direct input. (See [this](https://reddit.com/comments/17owo0t/comment/k94pq99) I wrote)

    So I would agree with "starts momentary" for as long as that's not taken to be in the sense of *an experience of pleasure* or some sort of special "click" that happens. 

    Rather, by the time the "experience" of jhāna comes up and the mind is joyous, the context has already become so steady that even if one stops protecting it, it will not go away for a good while (days, potentially). What is "momentary" is the context for as long as it depends on one's volition still.

### Beautiful commitment to truth in the suttas

There are suttas like MN 35:

>Now at that time Saccaka, the son of Jain parents, was staying in Vesālī. He was a debater and clever speaker **deemed holy by many people**.  
>  
>\[After getting into a debate with the Buddha, and seeing he was wrong\]  
>  
>Saccaka said to him, “Master Gotama, it was rude and impudent of me to imagine I could attack you in debate. For a person might find safety after attacking a rutting elephant, but not after attacking Master Gotama. A person might find safety after attacking a blazing mass of fire, but not after attacking Master Gotama. They might find safety after attacking a poisonous viper, but not after attacking Master Gotama. It was rude and impudent of me to imagine I could attack you in debate. Would Master Gotama together with the mendicant Saṅgha please accept tomorrow’s meal from me?” 

Where other leaders, deemed holy by others, confidently confront the Buddha, end up being completely wrong, *and are then capable of admitting they're wrong in front of their followers*, and basically being willing to declare that their teaching was absolutely wrong.

This is an easy thing to brush off since our focus is usually on more technical aspects of the suttas. But this is a very admirable and beautiful quality to have: the only thing I'm committed to is the truth about what leads me out of suffering, *regardless* of if *I* myself am considered an esteemed person by others. I cannot imagine the level of development Saccaka had to be able to admit his wrong in front of his followers, I would certainly hesitate stating I'm wrong (and then basically go onto list the numerous ways in which I was essentially stupid like Saccaka did up there) in front of just a *single* person who valued my opinions, let alone possibly hundreds.

Saccaka's commitment there is to the truth and truth *alone*, not commitment to maintaining his followers, not commitment to maintaining his tradition, not commitment to his teacher, not commitment to his prestige, *no*: it's *only* commitment to what leads him out of suffering, because otherwise, admitting so would be basically impossible. It's commitment to a teaching in which he knows,

>**These qualities lead to dispassion, not to passion**; to being unfettered, not to being fettered; to shedding, not to accumulating; to modesty, not to self-aggrandizement; to contentment, not to discontent; to seclusion, not to entanglement; to aroused persistence, not to laziness; **to being unburdensome, not to being burdensome.**  
>  
>AN 8.53

But what I've said above there about Saccaka's commitments isn't showing the seriousness of his commitment to the full extent. Realizing the full extent *personally*, would require actually inquiring whether *I* myself -- having currently not attained sotapatti -- am committed to whatever tradition I'm in, the great community within that tradition, the teachers who I've learned from and developed much from? Am I committed to the looks, appearances, elegant manner of movements of my teacher or am I committed to whether what they *say* will lead to freedom? If whatever tradition I'm in were to be proven wrong in its fundamental doctrines and effectiveness in ending my suffering, whatever views and practices it may advocate -- regardless of whether they've been of immense benefit to me --, would I hesitate having to leave all this behind for *my own well-being*? Or am I going to then come up with excuses to protect myself from having to face the pain of leaving the tradition, the teacher, and the community surrounding it?

I certainly cannot confidently and bravely say 'yes' to all the questions above. I've always had the fear of being wrong, being told I'm wrong, absolutely *hated* being wrong. This hate was taken to such an extent that I started paradoxically loved being wrong (whilst simultaneously absolutely hating it though) so that way I can fix it ASAP and reside in safety of being right. So paradoxically again, I'd hate being told HH's wrong if that ever happens, but I'd simultaneously be forcing myself to fix that wrong.

Either way, just wanted to share this reflection here. This quality is truly one of the most beautiful qualities in my opinion, I feel like if I ever saw someone doing what Saccaka did there, I would start tearing up because of how beautiful it is.

### Cover-up of the fragility of the body

As I keep reminding myself and keep re-establishing the context of ordaining *eventually*, confronting my parents *eventually*, not only have various sensualities become apparent, but the fragility of the body as well.

The fact that if I ordain and become a forest monk in the future, and I may not have access to the medical facilities we have now is *frightening*. I no longer need to mechanically remind myself of the 31 parts of the body, since every body part is 'seen' without the extra layer of medical-facilities-there-beforehand-to-fix-any-problem-with-it, the possibility of *truly* facing its changeability -- and the *implications* of it that were completely hidden beforehand; the suffering -- becomes apparent. I can no longer hide behind scientific advancements in the medical field to cover up the fragility of the body and its implications with regards to *dukkha*. 

I occasionally have toothaches; these were previously not problematic at all; of course, I wasn't going here and there telling myself that our current medical facilities are there for me in case something really bad happens, but the belief was there implicitly instilled within me from since I was young. Now when that assumption is being questioned (will any of this really be there for me?), the toothaches acquire a new meaning: having to *actually* face change, and the possibility of that negative change not changing for the rest of my life. This is *exactly* the fragility I felt 24/7 when I had chronic pain for years and no one could help.

The cover-up here isn't *only* scientific advancement though. The assumption that my "parents/relatives are *of course* there for me in case something happens" so that I'm not alone, and someone can take care of me, is also another 'layer' that covered up the fragility of the body.

Beforehand, if someone said this was the problem, I would've memorized of all these facts, then regurgitate all these facts mentally and call it "contemplation", however, it wouldn't produce any fear of facing the fragility as this is doing so now. The difference is that now there's a *genuine intention* that *genuinely* targets the assumptions that the danger hid behind, whereas previously, that contemplation would've been done *through* the very place of safety that I would be trying to contemplate against. How can I contemplate the dangers of the body, the dangers of *delighting* in the body, when my entire lifestyle is in some implicit sense the maintenance of the belief that I won't *really* have to face those dangers?

It's absolutely ridiculous just how much dirt a single *honest* intention can start to uncover. No wonder none of these "contemplations" were working beforehand.

    Yes, all of what you're describing here is essentially one of the big reasons why ordination is beneficial, despite all the gratuitous cultural and traditional baggage that has accumulated into it over time. *None of that* fundamentally offsets the benefit of exposing the vulnerability of your situation, and all the inauthentic and superficial cultural stuff will only become an obstacle for one who is inauthentic themselves.

    The 10th precept of abandoning money also makes quite a difference, and it's one of the reasons why laypeople cannot reach Arahantship, not because they don't wear a robe or have not shaven their heads. It's not *at all* the same to not have access to your bank account and go "off the grid" for months, than knowing that you will be *completely and utterly* dependent on other people's generosity from now onwards, and cannot pay for your own stuff even if your life depends on it. The former might feel unpleasant initially but one may ultimately come to enjoy it. The latter is like staring at an abyss, and it will only be pleasant to think and ponder on once you have made some *serious* progress, to the point where even falling down that abyss would not cause you suffering (although that recognition may unfortunately be mitigated by the excessive amount of wealth available in monasteries these days. Either way, the displeasure will be there if you know how to look for it, certainly the more you were dependent on the comforts of home life).

    And yes, the point you make about people back in the Buddha's day is quite accurate. It does not at all mean that those people were somehow not capable of seeking and delighting in sensual pleasures to the same degree that we can. The "amount" of sensuality is fundamentally not even that important. What really matters today is how the entire lifestyle is structured around preventing anything that may *compromise* one's access to pleasure.

    So, what really matters is not how much pleasure you've been having. What matters is how much the circumstances cover up the *impermanence* of that pleasure.

    Of course, the Buddha and his foremost disciples had been pampered throughout their youth, and even prevented from recognizing the calamities of the world on purpose. But the fact that they decided to go forth *immediately* after recognizing these things points to the fact that the amount of "dust in their eyes" was already pretty much non-existent. 

    This is not the case for anyone today who has had even a single, beloved family member die, and yet still do not feel an impulse to seek some sort of way out of suffering, nor recognize that engagement with sensuality cannot possibly be positively contributing to their predicament. And those who already have faith in he Buddhadhamma do not usually choose to intensify their practice on account of this. At least not in the sense of "practice" that matters, where they cease to engage, even as laypeople, with the things that expose them to the impermanence of life even more than is necessary.

### Separating the mind from the body.


In a previous post, it was mentioned that an Arahant's body can still react to certain situations like fear and anxiety. The only difference compared to an ordinary person is that an Arahant's mind has no ressistence towards the situation. An example was also given of how if a person was always scared of spiders since childhood, that bodily fear would still persist even in Arahanship. The only difference would be that despite experiencing fear in the body, an Arahant could, if needed, pick up that spider. That's why they are referred to as the "5 wild animals" in the suttas.

How does one make a clear distinction between the two in one's experience?

For instance, you are walking in the forest alone and recognize the features of a wild bear. Experientially, the implications of you being alone in the forest with a predator that can easily attack you will be there. That initial wave of bodily fear and body shakes will be there, the dhammas of a dark and dangerous predator will be there, and the vulnerability of your situation will be there for both the Arahant and the normal person.

But the Arahant will, despite all of these inputs and bodily reactions, still be somehow not moved while he is still moved.

So then, how can we truly measure the mind and truly separate it experientially?

The mind in that situation will be aware of all of these implications but will not want to get away from that situation or wouldn't want to change it, and this will be known by the observer and would be one dart less hitting him. Despite the seemingly overwhelming situation, an Arahant will not be moved despite being literally moved. He will not be moved because despite everything that could be happening, he has already created a space in his mind where suffering can't follow him. That space experientially will be felt like ease despite everything that could be happening. Like finding release within confinement.

So, as long as we find ourselves having the urge to make a change in whatever situation that has presented itself to us, then we are compromising our freedom from that unavoidable confinement that awaits all of us.

So, in brief, dhammas and implications remain. Feelings remain. Bodily reactions remain. What doesn't remain is the mind's resistance towards anything.

These have been some of my ponderings, and I would like to hear what you guys have to say about this matter.

    Correct:

    >I am not __afraid of fear__

    >our Teacher is __skilled in the Deathless__

    >the Path on which fear cannot land

    >by that Path the monks go.
    ―Theragātha 3.1

    
    However, it has to be born in mind that these descriptions are used for the sake of pointing people towards the correct way of relating to these experiences when they arise. It is ultimately a matter of semantics to say whether fear, or any other emotion, does or does not arise in an Arahant, and this is evidenced by so many Suttas in which it is said that Arahants are utterly and completely free from suffering and live in perpetual peace, and yet you find passages like the one in MN 121 (the last Sutta quoted below is synonymous with this) describing how the mere endurance of the 6 sense bases constitutes a "disturbance" that the Arahant will not be free from until the body breaks apart (the difference between Nibbāna-with-remainder and Final Nibbāna), but is not an issue whatsoever, as the Arahant is said to not long neither for life nor for death.

    What I mean to say with "used for the sake of pointing people towards the correct way of relating to these experiences" is that, if you tell a person that *fear should not arise,* what will happen is that, whether they like it or not, due to not seeing the signs of their mind and where greed, aversion and delusion actually are (MN 9 says from the start that only the sotapanna clearly knows wholesome as wholesome and unwholesome as unwholesome) they will most likely end up trying to *get rid of* and *interfere with* things that are within "the All", and this is not the Middle Way, and is "like a dog tying itself even tighter around the post", to use a simile the Buddha gave in a different context. This Sutta puts it best:

    > “Bhikkhus, *__All__* is __of a defiling nature (saṁkilesika-dhamma)__. And what, bhikkhus, is the All that is of a defiling nature? The eye is of a defiling nature Forms … Eye-consciousness … Eye-contact … __Whatever feeling arises with eye-contact as condition__ … that too is of a defiling nature

    >“The ear … The tongue … The body … The mind … Whatever feeling arises with mind-contact as condition … that too is of a defiling nature

    >“Seeing thus, bhikkhus, the instructed noble disciple experiences revulsion towards the eye, towards forms, towards eye-consciousness, towards eye-contact … He understands: ‘… there is no more for this state of being.’”

    ―SN 35.38 [expanded from the abridged version in the translation]

    And this connects perfectly with

    >For one who has abandoned greed,

    >and does not become greedy __amidst that which incites greed__

    >greed falls away from them

    >like water drops from a lotus

    [...]

    >For one who has abandoned aversion,

    >and does not become averse __amidst that which incites aversion__

    >aversion falls away from hem

    >like a palm nut from it's stem.

    ―Itivuttaka 4.9

    
    The point here is that, whether you like it or not, the mere arising of *any phenomenon whatsoever* is of a defiling nature, meaning that, if your practice consists of preventing certain phenomena from arising and ensuring that only certain others manifest (e.g. a bodily displeasure on account of a spider "should not" arise, but bodily equanimity or joy on account of a spider "should" arise), *you are defiled by what you think is "fine", and have failed to equally turn the mind away from*. (This is incidentally how mettā is often wrongly practiced).

     SN 35.28 is even more specific, mentioning greed, aversion and delusion specifically, point being that the problem is not that there is a fire in everything whatsoever that arises, but that because there is no dispassion, you are *touching some of it* always, and that is your suffering. Thus, when the noble disciple becomes fully dispassionate towards that which has fire in it (the entire world, internal and external), they will know that birth is destroyed and the holy life has been lived, as the discourse  ends.

    So, by telling a person that they need to allow even the fear to endure, what they will eventually learn to do is recognize that no amount of something that comes within the range of "the All" is truly the issue―because fire is harmless in and of itself―and they will be able to discern the subtle, gratuitous attitude "behind" the All, which is essentially craving. 

    However, it's important to note that there is absolutely no way to see this principle "where it is" with the intellect alone, because if there were, the utterance of another would be the only factor for stream entry, and there would be no need for developing yoniso manasikāra. There is no way to conceive of how the experience of a sotapanna, let alone an Arahant, is able to be without conceivings, because, as per MN 1, conceiving is what makes one a puthujjana.

    Thus:

    >So, in brief, dhammas and implications remain. Feelings remain. Bodily reactions remain. What doesn't remain is the mind's resistance towards anything.

    Yes, but one has to understand that even the thought of "what doesn't remain is the mind's resistance towards anything" is inevitably __ wrongly conceiving something that is within the All as "what doesn't remain"__, for as long as one is a puthujjana, and there is no way to "crawl out of that" even for a moment without ceasing to be a puthujjana. 

    In other words, the puthujjana's mind is conceiving an impermanent circumstance (the All is also defined by being utterly impermanent as the other Suttas in that series show), a particular, circumstancial, changeable configuration of the All as "freedom", and this is why the puthujjana does not see the Four Noble Truths, no matter how much sense they make intellectually, and how much they may like to believe that they're observing them in their experience and "doing their 4 respective duties" of understanding, abandoning, experiencing, and developing.

    It should be pointed out too that when it is said that "bodily fear still arises in an Arahant", the person without the Right View who does not see paṭiccasamuppāda will also not be able to see that what qualifies any given experience as what it is, is that which it simultaneously depends upon. In this case, if we classify "fear" as pressure (phassa) or feeling loosely speaking, that is *determined as what it is* by the six sense base (salayatana), as the PS "chain" tells us. 

    Thus, if the six sense base has *ceased to be a determination* (sankhara), whatever requires it as its simultaneous basis to exist will have "ceased" too. The feeling or pressure that may arise on account of the six  sense base is "ceased pressure" ("empty and hollow" as Ajahn Nyanamoli has described it in he past) meaning that it absolutely cannot be compared with what is happening when paṭiccasamuppāḍa is going with the grain in the ordinary person (anuloma), as opposed to against it (patiloma) with the Arahant.

    My recent essay about the [4 satipaṭṭhānas](https://www.hillsidehermitage.org/seeing-a-body-within-the-body/) is all about the principle that makes things cease to be sankharas when the Noble Disciple recollects it, and recognizing the principle at least would have to lead to sotapatti.

     >So then, how can we truly measure the mind and truly separate it experientially?

    Through the sustained *lifestyle* of virtue and sense restraint, you eventually learn to see the "extent" of the All whether you want it or not, which is where the pressure to act out of unwholesome things will be arising. 

    __The "container" within which the "stuff" of the All has to remain within long enough for you to see it is "leaking" as soon as you break your sense restraint,__ as Ven. Mahāmogallāna put it in SN 35.243. (This is usually translated as "corrupted" but the word "avassuta" which is the title of the discourse and the underlying metaphor really means "oozing; seeping; leaking").

    
    That is the necessary basis to start discerning the "distinction" between things and your craving on the right level, and one also should know the gist of what SN 1.1 describes. Initially one's efforts in that attitude to "not delight in things without trying to get rid of them", as we say, happening within the virtue and sense restraint, will be inaccurate. But if at no point one dupes oneself into thinking that one is succeeding in seeing the distinction between feeling and craving, one will eventually see for oneself what yoniso manasikāra really is, at which point he Four Noble Truths will be obvious, and "the All" will remain what it always was, in the following way:

        >"Why now do you assume ‘a being’?
        Māra, is that your speculative view?
        This is a heap of sheer formations:
        Here no being is found.

        
        >"Just as, with an assemblage of parts,
        The word ‘chariot’ is used,
        So, when the aggregates exist,
        There is the convention ‘a being.’

        
        >“It’s only suffering that comes to be,
        Suffering that stands and falls away.
        Nothing but suffering comes to be,
        Nothing but suffering ceases.”
        ―SN 7.10

        But, again, the ordinary person will hear "this is just a heap of formations", and the peripheral attitude of their mind that they still cannot see (cittanimitta) will―*literally* like a wild animal that does its own thing no matter what you tell it, hence we use that comparison so much―interpret that as *"the heap of formations  must become different"*, i.e. __Nibbāna is the fact that the All is now a certain way as opposed to another__, and that is management, not *uprooting* of suffering, the title of [this talk](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zndwMKAszWM).

        Note also how the above Sutta does not say that suffering "does not exist" and the Arahant becomes unaware of it. It's simply that the full dispassion of the purified *citta* (as in, it's not *them* being dispassionate, because "they" are the heap of formations that is nothing but suffering) makes it impossible for them to become involved with it and "touch" the fire as in SN 35.28 above, and thus there is impossibility to suffer *amidst* suffering, as Ajahn Nyanamoli likes to put it. Or, there is "Stillness Flowing", as Ajahn Chah often said.

        All this may make the path sound easier and that there is not much distance between a puthujjana and an Arahant, but it's completely the opposite. The distance that there is is immeasurable, literally. It's just that whatever the puthujjana conceives that "distance" to be is not what it is. Thus, when they walk along that "direction", they are not approaching Arahantship, they are approaching a different kind of All that is less unpleasant, but they will still be "touching it" and getting burned―without recognizing it of course. Only the stream enterer and above has gained the blueprint to "bridge the gap" between themselves and the Arahant.

        
        Pretty much all of what I wrote [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/17radll/ive_been_having_crisis_lately) is closely related to this topic, and the reply on the other thread titled "meanings" is pointing to the same principle. All of this is just describing the Middle Way.

        (I know this is even longer than usual, but this is the core of the Dhamma that can basically never be fully exhausted in explanation.)

    In the process of writing the other reply, I eventually forgot to add that there is a big "but" to all this. 

    When the mind is established in samādhi, even the body calms down, as the Suttas say. As in, the powerful, sharp feelings that may have otherwise arisen, say by the Arahant coming across the spider, will not even arise at that moment. This is why Ven. Mahākassapa in SN 16.5 decided to stay in his austere environment, which meant that he would have even easier access to the jhānas that in a more comfortable setting ("I see for myself a pleasant abiding here and now", the first reason he listed). As in, that's more pleasant than having to experience the "disturbance of the body" mentioned in MN 121 *without* samādhi, but either way there would be no suffering if he had to leave that environment. This is one example of how an Arahant can perfectly well still have "preferences", something contemporary views would sometimes deny.

    The "body calming down", which means essentially the senses,  is what SN 35.247 refers to, where the animals eventually become tired and lay down, a simile for how the senses cease to pull towards agreeable things and away from disagreeable ones.

    This Sutta illustrates very well our point that what leads to samādhi is sense restraint and the practice of sati as *recollection of a context*, not *attention to one thing*. As it says, you tie the animals to the post, and then __let them try to get away as much as they want, making sure only that the rope and post (context) do not budge__. This is what you do with right context and yoniso manasikāra, as opposed to the contemporary approach of taking up an object, which is more akin to shooting the animals with a tranquiziler gun so that they stop pulling ASAP.

    Therefore, the practice of samādhi is not something *apart* from the withstanding of pressure without delighting in it that I have been alluding to here. It's not about "suppressing things", as some would say in regard to the five hindrances. That is not within the Middle Way, so whatever wisdom that samādhi will give rise to, no matter how calm your body feels, is not the right one. For this reason there is wrong samādhi and right samādhi mentioned in the Suttas many times, and wrong samādhi is there when wrong view is there, i.e. that the All is the problem, not one's craving in regard to it. *There is no mention that there will be some sort of alarm warning you that "this is wrong!",* since otherwise no one would practice it, keeping in mind the fact that the puthujjana fails to see skilful as skilful and unskilful as unskilful by definition. "Wrong samādhi" would naturally be taken by practitioners as that which anybody but them might be doing, and as some ridiculous practice that only adherents of other religions would engage in.

    So, quite contrary to what people often misunderstand from our instruction, "enduring things on the right level" long enough naturally results in samādhi, and in the body calming down. It's just that one initially needs to be able to take on trust that what one's wild mind is trying to convince is the true problem (the All, the feeling that has arisen, the perceptions of fear, whatever), actually isn't. This is why, in AN 10.61, "faith" or "trust" (saddhā) is said to be the prerequisite for yoniso manasikāra, which is what "starves" the hindrances according to SN 46.51.

    Last but not least, "body becoming calm" in samādhi does not *necessarily* mean sitting still, since, as said above, that primarily refers to the senses and their pressure, not to one's bodily posture and sensations. And one thing is absolutely sure: the first jhāna would not involve sitting perfectly still, given that vitakkavicāra is naturally a form of movement in relation to the 5 senses. 

    AN 3.64 (SuttaCentral numbering) has one imagine the Buddha, walking, standing, sitting and lying down while his mind is in the "celestial abidings" of the four jhānas.

    >I'm not certain why exactly a more austere environment than that compared to a monk's lifestyle would be more conducive for jhanas...

    The answer you gave is correct in a general sense, but there is a much more acute reason. It should be clear from reflecting on what I wrote here that the main point is *pressure* of any kind is not the problem, and that calm arises by enduring the pressure on the "right level", which in turn leads to the pressure being temporarily not even felt (i.e. when there is samādhi).

    So, by living in a more austere environment where you will be constantly exposed to discomfort, you have *no choice* but to be enduring pressure *all the time*, and, when you have learned the principle of right context and have tamed the mind to the point of being an Arahant like he was, that means you have a constant incentive to not let the context lapse so as to keep even the senses, not just the citta, calm. (Because the whole point of Arahantship is that you don't have to be practicing mindfulness anymore, so an Arahant can just forget about everything the Buddha taught and be completely fine, and in a comfortable environment they would naturally tend to do so more―not that there is ignorance involved in that of course. It's just that their samādhi won't be as good, but since they are dispassionate towards even the presence or absence of samādhi, ultimately they are not affected by either.)

    As I said above on how restraint makes you become aware of the full "size" of the All, taking that restraint even further, to the point of asceticism, *if you do it for the right reasons and not for foolish self-mortification*, reveals the "size" of that All even more, so that, in the case on an Arahant who was already fully incapable of "touching it" by default, they can now even start "moving away from it", so to speak (doesn't mean you stop perceiving it, but literally that the mind is becoming more and more "elevated" while it's there, like a hot air balloon. That's samādhi, not going "deeper" into something like people think). 

    And, ironically that is a "pleasant abiding", not a specific configuration of a pleasant All that you take to be samādhi. That's still "burning you" if you take it for granted and don't turn the mind away from it although you won't realize, so it can never be the same profound, literally immeasurable through the "Allness of the All", joy and relief, even if your body is having an orgasm. This is why samādhi has to lead to abandoning fetters whether one likes it or not and is the most refined factor of the Path―it's the most palpable thing that takes you in the same direction of enduring pressure correctly, and "rewards" you on account of it to boot, so that eventually you end up with a mind like AN 6.55 and SN 35.228 describe even outside of samādhi.

    And this is the only feasible explanation as to how Bāhiya became immediately an Arahant upon hearing "in the seen let there just be the seen". Samādhi is already an emulation of that principle, although the person, if they haven't been told about anattā *(the "you will be neither here nor yonder...." bit)* , would not be able to surmount the higher "plane" of the *samādhi itself*, so that the mind becomes permanently free. In other words, Bāhiya *must* have been very skilled in jhānas, which is why he genuinely thought he was an Arahant as the Bahiyasutta says. A person who became enlightened so easily could not have been lying to themselves and just being arrogant. As the Buddha said, same would've happened with his former formless attainment teachers who unfortunately passed away before he could teach them the Dhamma. And all of these were hardcore "ascetics".

    
    > Experientially, it would be like having a very strong urge towards an activity that, in a way, feels like it has to be done...

    Yes, that would be a good example. Any intention can be the basis for unwholesome and acting out of pressure, although of course there is no hope in recognizing the most general level of the principle unless the virtue, celibacy and restraint are there from well beforehand, and the mind has already "dried up" from unwholesome quite a bit on account of them, a process which you cannot "accelerate" so that it happens within 10 days, for instance.

    >Then what follows is rinse and repeat development of the theme of danger, and if pressure comes towards an action, you then bring back the theme and its implications. Sometimes you have to just stick it out, despite the horrible pressure and your mind just not wanting to listen. But you would know that this will be for your welfare. And in time, you would see that you will not be bothered as much as before, which will be a very peaceful experience.

    Certainly. That's why "you" are the trainer who ultimately needs to be the "adult" so to speak, and know what is for the welfare of both you and the wild animal in the end. And you start "knowing" at least the information of what a good trainer is by reading the Suttas,  contemplating, etc.

    Now of course, one must also not be *hoping* for a diminishing of pressure. What will happen is that sometimes you will have the right attitude and will be able to tame the mind a little bit on the right level, but at other times the tendency to try to "configure" the All will come back and you won't even realize it (as in, you're trying to "aim" at a new feeling now, instead of enduring whatever is there). So that's why I said on the other reply I linked to on the other comment that you must completely give up the expectation of "something" that will come OR go away as a result of the context, and focus on "including", as we say, the entirety of expectations, hopes, desires, ideas, and notions that may arise within the container of the All that is dangerous to act out of even mentally.

    (That doesn't mean you start trying to practice some sort of "open awareness" to include everything at once, which in the end will mean just including irrelevant sensations and perceptions, the sound of the birds or whatever. It just means that whatever is present now, especially in terms of pleasant or unpleasant thoughts, you don't start "running with your own feet" on account of it, even if the mind is thinking it on its own accord. That's what it means to "not grasp at signs and features"―it doesn't mean *not having* signs and features. It's also what non-proliferation (nippapañca) means, not stopping thinking and concepts or whatnot).

    Edit: Regarding the first part about "asceticism", the Jains (and even some Buddhist monks today) go wrong in that, for them, asceticism was basically rooted in wishful thinking that suffering would be cured eventually on account of it, and were not making effort to *understand* the mental resistance caused by depriving themselves of comfort, which would have led them to jhānas at least, like Bāhiya certainly must've had (another contemporary view is that most other ascetics back then had only samādhi but no wisdom, but there is no support for that in the Suttas. The ones who did have samādhi were these rare cases who became enlightened easily).

    >One of the most important factors is the context, and the context is the driving force that will help me transcend it eventually.

    >The context is the driving force for development of samadhi and the progression towards jhanas.

    Yes, but what I was hinting at was the fact that the context is "polluted" for as long as it maintains that *something* in the experience should change. *Looking forward to a pleasant experience* of peace means hoping for such a change instead of being exclusively concerned with the context (that's the simile of the hen *wishing* for the eggs to hatch instead of just sitting on them regardless of her wishes, because of which the eggs don't hatch).

    So, only by including *even that* within the context is there a chance that you may be transcending the entire "plane" of sensuality and hindrances that I referred to in the comment I linked. Otherwise, that renunciation is really just a subtler desire.

    It's also what I meant there by mentioning that if one's "pleasure of seclusion" depends on *exclusively* having thoughts of renunciation, and there is no pressure there at the same time to which that renunciation is applying, so both the pressure and the context "counterweighing" each other at the same time, then that's not the sort of pleasure that should be cultivated. It will be a form of dependence on circumstances.

    The answer is implicit in the replies I wrote on this thread.

    > internal perceptions of fear and terror don’t arise in the suttas for arahants though

    This is true, because "internal" refers to the citta as opposed to the six senses (hence MN 10 talks about knowing whether a hindrance is "internally" present, a word which has a very clear purpose there because all hindrances are inherently not in the outside world, so it has to mean more than just that).

    >the suttas consistently note that “fear, horripilation, & terror” can’t be aroused in an arahant.

    That is also true, if we understand it in that "internal" sense.

    >and so the the bodily reactions of fear and terror don’t arise either. 

    As I wrote in the "In the process of..." reply above, cessation of bodily reactions only occurs during samādhi, which an Arahant is [not perpetually within](https://suttacentral.net/sn17.30/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=sidebyside&reference=main&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin). Also, when Māra is said to tempt the Buddha or Arahants in the Suttas, what he is essentially doing is arousing bodily reactions, as the body (six senses) is his property that he can manipulate as he wishes, which he says himself in SN 4.19 (here what is translated generally as "contact and its field/base of consciousness" is what we often refer to as "pressure" (phassa). When there is pleasant pressure [there is always](https://suttacentral.net/sn48.39/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin) a corresponding pleasant feeling, and so on.)

    He doesn't "tempt" only by speaking random verses and interrupting their seclusion.

    An Arahant cannot "get aroused" in a sense. See this statement from the Vinaya, Parajika 1:

    >At one time a monk was lying down in the Jātiyā Grove at Bhaddiya, having gone there for the day’s meditation. He had an erection because of wind. A certain woman saw him and sat down on his penis. Having taken her pleasure, she left. Seeing the moisture, the monks told the Buddha. “Monks, an erection occurs for five reasons: because of sensual desire, feces, urine, or wind, or because of being stung by caterpillars. It’s impossible that that monk had an erection because of sensual desire. That monk is a perfected one. There’s no offense for that monk.”

    >The fact that Mara can just control bodily reactions make Arahants more human but also more impressive.

    What I meant with bodily reactions wasn't so much this, but that when thoughts about the past arise or memories about the the future (the arising of which is in Māra's control in a sense, you can't completely prevent certain things from coming up in your mind, proven by how some monks are overcome by sexual fantasies even though they don't want to have them) there is implicit "pressure" arising on the level of the senses. Hence SN 4.19 I quoted saying that pressure/phassa belongs to Māra. But because the Arahant's are developed towards the pressure, there is no lust or aversion whatsoever.

    This is what SN 35.240 mean and SN 35.243 mean by saying that Māra tries to "gain access" through each sense base pretty much constantly. In the latter Sutta even says "he overwhelms sights; sights don't overwhelm him". It's not that the sights changed their significance, but that the mind became developed in regard to them.

    The two similes Mahāmoggallāna gives about the "blazing glass torch" approaching either a shed or dry reeds or a plastered hut show that the attack is not *different*. What's different is what the house is made of.

    See also MN 119 about the "benefits of kayagatasati". It doesn't say that fear and dread or delight and discontent do not arise, but that *you overwhelm them*, they don't overwhelm *you*.

    >Is it just me, or did I just read a sutta where a woman raped a monk, and it was pretty much okay because it was not out of sensual desire? 😂

    No, not so fast... it doesn't say that the monk consented to it. If you consent to it you're not a monk anymore; that's how the first pārājika works. So he must have been ill or something.

    See this:

    >“Again, some bhikkhu can endure the clouds of dust, the crests of the standards, the uproar, and a blow. Having triumphed in that battle, he emerges victorious and settles at the head of the battlefield. What is the victory in his case? When the bhikkhu has gone to the forest, to the foot of a tree, or to an empty hut, a woman approaches him, sits down or lies down next to him, and embraces him. But he disentangles himself, frees himself, and goes off wherever he wants

    >“He resorts to a secluded lodging: the forest, the foot of a tree, a mountain, a ravine, a hillside cave, a charnel ground, a jungle highland, the open air, a heap of straw. Gone to the forest, to the foot of a tree, or to an empty hut, he sits down, folding his legs crosswise, straightening his body, and establishing mindfulness in front of him. Having abandoned longing for the world, he dwells with a mind free from longing; he purifies his mind from longing. Having abandoned ill will and hatred, he dwells with a mind free from ill will, compassionate toward all living beings; he purifies his mind from ill will and hatred. Having abandoned dullness and drowsiness, he dwells free from dullness and drowsiness, percipient of light, mindful and clearly comprehending; he purifies his mind from dullness and drowsiness. Having abandoned restlessness and remorse, he dwells without agitation, with a mind inwardly peaceful; he purifies his mind from restlessness and remorse. Having abandoned doubt, he dwells having gone beyond doubt, unperplexed about wholesome qualities; he purifies his mind from doubt.

    >“Having abandoned these five hindrances, defilements of the mind that weaken wisdom, secluded from sensuality, secluded from unwholesome states, he enters and dwells in the first jhāna … 

    —AN 3.75

    
    (Note that the comparison with soldiers in this Sutta is partially to inspire the monks, but it's not rooted in some puritanical notions. It's easy to think that as someone who has never taken on celibacy for life. You literally win the hardest battle of all, because there is a knife right at your throat to say "yes" to it... coming from your own body, of course, that you can't be outside of even if you want to. A person who has not been celibate for several months or years may think they can easily just say "no" and thus sexual intercourse is not a big deal, but that's just like how if an addict took their heroin 15 minutes ago, they won't had a hard time not taking it again anytime soon).

    In the ["case studies"](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1/en/brahmali?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin) of the first pārājika, there are other stories of monks who were assaulted by women and because they were conscious of what was happening, they immediately kicked them off and left. Those who consented consciously were expelled.

    Fundamentally, although the form of an Arahant or Anāgāmi who is not in samādhi still "pulls" towards the counterpart of their body and finds that possibility inherently alluring, *the citta* of the Arahant (or even the puthujjana free from sensuality in MN 142, i.e. who gets jhānas) perceives *their own body* as a "charcoal pit" by default, and when it's pulling like that even more so (SN 12.66 says *your senses* are that in the world that is pleasant and agreeable, and __that__ is what is being compared to a poisonous drink. The objects are secondary. The "pull" I'm referring to is the nice appearance, aroma and taste of the drink, which an Arahant does not get rid of, as the simile implies).

    So since *choice*/kamma is always rooted in the citta (connected in Pali to cetana) they would be incapable of consenting.

    Also, the fact that the monk proceeds to enter the jhānas after the incident in the Sutta I quoted is not a coincidence. Contrary to the way it works with micchāsamādhi, where this occurence would have left "imprints" on the mind that would prevent one from focusing well on the object for a good while—refusing to listen to one's biological drives *through* the right context of danger and non-ownership, not of denial and ignoring, is the true pleasure of withdrawal from unwholesome. Meaning, if this were to happen to you every day, your jhāna would only be strengthened.

    
    >Jesus Christ, so in that situation, Mara is just taking control of his body and the woman's and just doing as he sees fit. I understand that it's Mara's, but couldn't that Arahant or Anagami just leave or do something to avoid that situation? Even if it was not done out of sensual desire, those animals would definitely be more wild than they were.

    Not quite. Māra cannot "possess your body". That's *never* what we would mean with "eliciting bodily reactions". What Māra can do is present objects, mainly to your sixth sense base, that will cause your body to experience its present state as "lacking". At least that's the only access he would have when you're in the forest. This is the reason for the statements in MN 150.

    When the body perceives that "lack" that is being pointed at by mano (also part of the body), it "reacts" to it with wanting (hence "bodily reaction"), but if the citta is developed [in withstanding that "lack"](http://suttacentral.net/sn35.228/en/sujato), no action, even mental, will be committed on account of it, and the arising of a bodily saṅkhāra will not be proliferated into lust [(see the discussion of "transparent mind")](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/17v0cqw/re_the_foundational_reality_of_humans_as_primates/), not even with one's (1) intentional thinking with delight, nor (2) denial and aversion, that would be present in the ordinary, untamed citta that knows nothing apart from those 2.

    So yes, they would *never* allow their animals to get wild like that intentionally. *Actions* result in an entirely different level of wildness than the arising of mere perceptions does. That's why without [actions, there is no suffering.](https://suttacentral.net/sn46.26/en/bodhi?lang=en) Only the ordinary person makes their senses wild on purspose and *enjoys it*, sadly not being aware that they're about to relinquish their well-being in the stupidest, __most preventable__ way of all. Pulling the trigger on yourself, pretty much.

    But either way, the developed mind is not afraid of the animals [getting infinitely wild](https://suttacentral.net/AN6.55/en/sujato). Plus, that wildness would, if they're in good health and in seclusion, *aid* in outlining the first jhāna.

    Edit: I should note a mistranslation in the last Sutta I linked, which will also serve to illustrate the point. "Compelling" understates the true meaning of "bhusa", meaning "strong, mighty, forceful, intense, potent". So the translator has the view that Arahantship is about not experiencing feelings, pretty much.

### meaning

are we looking for the meaning of something

or do we give meaning to something

this phenomenon that we called a perception can be called a meaning too isnt,it?

It can be said that in the beginning we give meaning to everything, especially when we were a new born baby, a child and do not know even the meaning of the language we use.

So what is the correct meaning according to the Buddha? 

And what criteria are used to understand that a perception is a wrong perception? 

How does meaning become a tool or one of a vehicle toward right view?

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/17s275j/meaning/k8pxclj/)** _2023-11-11 00:16:47:

    >It can be said that in the beginning we give meaning to everything, especially when we were a new born baby, a child and do not know even the meaning of the language we use.

    This needs qualification. "We" don't give meaning to things. Rather, the five aggregates are meaningful in and of themselves.

    The view you seem to refer to often leads to the idea that "concepts" or even "language" are the basis for ignorance, and that to achieve true knowledge one must abolish concepts and remove the meanings that experience naturally has. This is wrong view, a suggested "shortcut" to enlightenment that only covers up one's suffering in the end.

    >So what is the correct meaning according to the Buddha? 

    You could say that ultimately there is no correct meaning, and yet experience always has its own meaning at any given time, even for an Arahant. The ultimate goal of practicing the Buddha's teaching is to gain the ability allow experience to have the meaning that it has always had (the five aggregates persisting, changing or persisting-while-changing) without craving for or against it (Arahantship).

    This relates to what I wrote [here](https://reddit.com/comments/17radll/comment/k8lzw85) regarding how one must allow __any__ feeling (and of course any other aggregate), no matter on acount of what it manifests and what meaning it has, to endure.

    To use the example in that thread, the experience of faeces and urine has a meaning of "this is disgusting", and what one must do to practice properly is not *try to get rid of that*, but learn how there can come to be no aversion despite the very sharp and intense presence of that meaning. Yoniso manasikāra is what starts taking one in that direction.

    >How does meaning become a tool or one of a vehicle toward right view?

    So, in the process of developing this "ultimate aspect" of the teaching which is Arahantship, one needs to learn to discern certain meanings within the experience which are overlooked by default. These are the things that the Buddha talked about as "the practice", such as discerning the three characteristics, the four satipatthanas, the danger in sensual pleasures, and so on.

    However, the key is to be able to *recognize* those meanings in the experience as being already there, even when you were not thinking about them, without misusing them to *suppress* the other meanings that one feels uncomfortable with, such as the meaning of disgust described above, or even the meaning of "agreeability" in a pleasant sense object. Misusing them in that way entails diverging from the Middle Way.

    In other words, the right meanings can only be truly seen by *enduring* the pressure and discomfort of the "wrong" meanings. Then, once those "right" meanings sit at the background of the "wrong" meanings whenever they arise, one does not even need to cultivate the "right" meanings anymore, and this is essentially Arahantship, the ability to even forget about "dukkha" or anything else the Buddha said without any perversions of perception being possible.

    >And what criteria are used to understand that a perception is a wrong perception? 

    Thus, don't try to figure out what is wrong perception by looking at the *experience*, such as how something makes you feel or what meaning it has, given that an Arahant still perfectly experiences even sensual objects as pleasant (but they do not seek them out) and disagreeable experiences as unwanted (Ven. Channa in MN 144).

    Instead, think of "wrong perception" as being first and foremost measured by your *choice to act* by body, speech and mind in unwholesome ways with regard to the perception that was already there before you acted. By purifying that, all perversions of perception are purified.

    (All this is why the preface to Ajahn Nyanamoli's essay with the same title talks about *"understanding meanings"* instead of "looking for *"The Meaning"*)

### I've been having crisis lately

My parents are approaching old age right now, and as their son I have to take care of them. Although I care about them as they have been a good parents to me, I'm really panicking over the thoughts of one day I need to help them urinate and defecate.

&#x200B;

I've always been a clean freak, and the thought of taking care of someone else bodily fluid deeply scares me. I also visited some subreddits about caring for aging parents, and it makes me even more anxious and depressed.

&#x200B;

Idk, I guess it's just part of life and I have to deal with it, but how do you not get affected by looking at gross things and smelling them? Idk if achieving noble attainments can even make you not affected by it.

    >Idk, I guess it's just part of life and I have to deal with it, but how do you not get affected by looking at gross things and smelling them? Idk if achieving noble attainments can even make you not affected by it.

    Don't worry about *not experiencing* digust, because that is not true equanimity (which, despite how it may sound, makes the path immeasurably harder, not easier, but at the same time makes it doable, not a mere fatasy, after a tremendous amount of effort, contemplation, and time):

    >“Herein, what are the six kinds of equanimity based on the household life? On seeing a form with the eye, equanimity arises in a foolish infatuated ordinary person, in an untaught ordinary person who has not conquered his limitations or conquered the results [of action] and who is blind to danger. __Such equanimity as this does not transcend the form; that is why it is called equanimity based on the household life.__
    “On hearing a sound with the ear…On smelling an odour with the nose…On tasting a flavour with the tongue…On touching a tangible with the body…On cognizing a mind-object with the mind, equanimity arises in a foolish infatuated ordinary person, in an untaught ordinary person who has not conquered his limitations or conquered the results [of action] and who is blind to danger. Such equanimity as this does not transcend the mind-object; that is why it is called equanimity based on the household life. These are the six kinds of equanimity based on the household life.

    
    >“Herein, what are the six kinds of equanimity based on renunciation? When, by knowing the impermanence, change, fading away, and cessation of forms, one sees as it actually is with proper wisdom that forms both formerly and now are all impermanent, suffering, and subject to change, equanimity arises. __Such equanimity as this transcends the form; that is why it is called equanimity based on renunciation.__
    “When, by knowing the impermanence, change, fading away, and cessation of sounds…of odours…of flavours…of tangibles… of mind-objects, one sees as it actually is with proper wisdom that mind-objects both formerly and now are all impermanent, suffering, and subject to change, equanimity arises. Such equanimity as this transcends the mind-object; that is why it is called equanimity based on renunciation. These are the six kinds of equanimity based on renunciation.
    ―MN 137

    You will eventually develop equanimity that "transcends the object" first and foremost through keeping the 8 precepts and sense restraint in the right way. Instead of trying to force yourself through psychotherapy to stop perceiving sights, sounds, smells, tastes and touches as agreeable or disagreeable so as to make your restraint easier, you focus on *not resisting* the experience of disagreeable when it arises, regardless of how disagreeable it is, and not acting towards agreeable objects, no matter how agreeable they are. You don't try to "stop" either of them, which would be you claiming ownership over the aggregate of feeling. That's because feeling, no matter how intense, is *part* of the object, it's not part of "you". So if your equanimity depends on modifying the feeling, as is the usual approach, you will still be "infatuated, not transcending the object", like the passage above describes.

    This would lead eventually to the *mind* not being affected *in the face of disgust*, a reaction of your body which is ultimately not in your control, and with that any suffering it might cause you will have completely disappeared. In fact, the disgust would remind you of your freedom of mind and dispassion on the right level. Through this you would also recognize the way out of every single unwholesome state that might arise. 

    But this is absolutely not a magic pill, and it's not enough to understand it in theory. It requires a complete overhaul of the way you live to enable it, unlike the ways of developing "equanimity" you would tend to hear about today.

    >This is an interesting sutta reference that I wasn't too familiar with. 

    Understandably. Unfortunately, this belongs to a large corpus of Suttas that are either overlooked, or assumed to have some trifle meaning, and yet what they point to is absolutely key.

    >In what sense is it using the term "infatuation"? Infatuation seems like an odd pairing with equanimity.

    This could be explained in various ways, but since the discussion here has mainly gone in the direction of feeling:

    >“How, householder, is one afflicted in body and afflicted in mind? Here, householder, the uninstructed worldling, who is not a seer of the noble ones and is unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma, who is not a seer of superior persons and is unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma, regards [form....] feeling as self, or self as possessing feeling, or feeling as in self, or self as in feeling. __He lives obsessed by the notions: ‘I am feeling, feeling is mine.’ As he lives obsessed by these notions, that feeling of his changes and alters. With the change and alteration of feeling, there arise in him sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair.__
    [perception ... intentions .... consciousness....]
    ―SN 22.1

    That "living obsessed by these notions" is, in passing, not something that the person will be aware of at the core level where it is, since otherwise it would not be happening. The notion of "mine" with regard to feeling is no less than the core of all infatuations, and the name "infatuation" fits well in fact because it's something that causes perspective to be muddled, which means that simply having it entails not being clear about its nature... and not being clear about its nature entails having it. If one were to become aware of it, it would have to disappear, never to return (hence the categorical divide found in the Suttas between noble disciple and ordinary person).

    
    >Therefore, bhikkhus, __any__ kind of feeling whatsoever, whether past, future, or present, internal or external, __gross or subtle, inferior or superior,__ far or near, all feeling should be seen as it really is with correct wisdom thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’
    ―SN 22.59

    Now, if a person takes on the practice of equanimity with the view that certain feelings should not arise because *they* are the suffering, they are for that very reason failing to truly see "this is not mine" with regard to __any__ kind of feeling, regardless of whether it's on account of this or on account of that. Because that's the point of the Dhamma: no amount of feeling IS suffering; rather, *craving* in regard to feeling is suffering. Most Buddhists would reply with "of course", but, as said above, if one had understood this even to he basic degree, suffering would have permanently diminished to "7 grains of sand", as the Suttas say.

    For as long as a person's equanimity rests upon even a tiny attitude of control towards feeling, the infatuation, the notion of "mine" has not been abandoned. It is simply going in the opposite direction than before. Furthermore, that equanimity will be circumstancial and flimsy, because there simply are things that are felt extremely unpleasantly for as long as one is alive (and that is not a problem if there is no craving), and one can only succeed so much in avoiding them (which people who take on the practice tend to become skilled at over time.)

    Since such a state of mind is inherently liable to deteriorate, it is essentially of the nature of a possession that one can be afraid of losing, and that entails a subtle degree of intoxication with it as well, which will also not be obvious to the untrained mind.

    >“Bhante, when a bhikkhu is thus perfectly liberated in mind, even if powerful forms cognizable by the eye come into range of the eye, they do not obsess his mind; his mind is not at all affected. It remains steady, attained to imperturbability, and he observes its vanishing. Even if powerful sounds cognizable by the ear come into range of the ear … Even if powerful odors cognizable by the nose come into range of the nose … Even if powerful tastes cognizable by the tongue come into range of the tongue … Even if powerful tactile objects cognizable by the body come into range of the body … Even if powerful phenomena cognizable by the mind come into range of the mind, they do not obsess his mind; his mind is not at all affected. It remains steady, attained to imperturbability, and he observes its vanishing.

    >“Suppose, Bhante, there were a stone mountain, without clefts or fissures, one solid mass. If a violent rainstorm should come from the east, it could not make it quake, wobble, and tremble; if a violent rainstorm should come from the west … from the north … from the south, it could not make it quake, wobble, and tremble. So too, when a bhikkhu is thus perfectly liberated in mind, even if powerful forms cognizable by the eye come into range of the eye … Even if powerful phenomena cognizable by the mind come into range of the mind, they do not obsess his mind; his mind is not at all affected. It remains steady, attained to imperturbability, and he observes its vanishing.
    ―AN 6.55

    Instead of what this passage describes, the "infatuated equanimity" is more like "when a person abides thus, __no form that comes into the range of the eye is powerful__" And this is temporary, shaky freedom from *feeling*, not freedom from craving, and adhering to it with the idea that it's the latter will obstruct one from treading the much harder path towards actually reaching it. 

    To be more specific, we could say that the misconception lies in thinking that if one can have certain *perceptions* arise (say, of faeces and urine as the questioner mentioned) and yet not experience the usual *feeling* that comes with them, there is equanimity. MN 137 quoted above actually says "has not overcome the boundary" not "...his limitations" in Pali. That boundary is the domain of feeling, which the person cannot withstand if the temporary suppression fails.

    This is why the Suttas speak even of "micchāvimutti", wrong liberation. It's not that there is no liberation in such a case, but that it's not the right one that will remain permanently and stand the test of when it's time for the body to break apart at the latest―the most excrutiating experience possible. The Buddha always alluded to death when he wanted to talk about immense pain, and it is utterly gratuitous to assume that experience just suddenly shuts off if you get shot in the head, for example.

    (On extremely disagreeable feelings still arising when there is no craving, see Arahant Channa's description of his experience prior to his own suicide in MN 144. Notice how there was very clearly a feeling there; it was not just "neutral" bodily sensations, and his reply when questioned as not "I'm fine, it's just a sensation" as many would expect from an Arahant―and yet, he was completely free from suffering despite that. For a Sutta with a similar message to AN 6.55 above, see SN 35.228, also referring to the Arahant.)

    >What does it mean Bhante? Would it still be prone to puking when it see gross stuff if I have develop it enough?

    You may still be prone, or you may not.

    The thing to understand is that *right now* there is fear in your mind, and that's the only reason you're asking the question. If you were to abandon that fear here and now, you wouldn't be asking the question with anxiety. You would stop caring whether you will puke or not because you would know that either way you will not suffer (and, if anything, *this* would most strongly contribute to your not puking, more than any psychotherapy you might do while you're still *afraid* of that unpleasant feeling and simply try to make it not be there).

    It also depends on one's samādhi level at the time, which even for an Arahant can be quite low if they've been really sick (Ven. Channa in MN 144 I quoted above) or busy with mundane things and with little seclusion (SN 17.30). Nevertheless, their inability to suffer *even* if the body felt like puking would never deteriorate, and they would not run away from things on account of fear.

    Of course, "samādhi" here is to be understood as the imperturbable, unified (ekagga) context and clarity of comprehension of the sense domain that leads even the body to calm down completely (temporarily). Not as being absorbed in one thing.

    So, you could summarize it like this: instead of trying to abandon the disgust directly and forcefully, focus only on learning to abandon fear of disgust (or of any kind of emotional pressure). That would prevent you from having any issues in your life, even if you had to experience your worst nightmare in the flesh.

    (Edited accidental reference to SN 12.28 instead of SN 17.30)

    >So there is reactive equanimity, as in one focus on the perception of the arisen object of the senses, which allows the person to forget about, or avoid/turn a blind eye to uncomfortable thoughts and feelings in regard to the unpleasant situation.

    Yes, "reactive equanimity" is a good term. The person is not aware that their attempt to not feel the feeling is already a reaction to the feeling (and fundamentally it always subtly remains at the back of your mind, you're just suppressing it), thus it's rooted in aversion even though the stated intention is to abandon unwholesome. That's why it's said that the Right View is the beginning of  the Middle Way, and the whole world adheres to either welcoming or rejecting. This includes even people who intellectually agree with the Buddha's teaching but still don't have the Right View. It's not a matter of choice. This attempt towards "reactive equanimity" is also the subtlest form of self-mortification that won't necessarily feel painful at all for the undeveloped mind, and may even give rise to blissful experiences, which are not jhāna because they're outside the Middle Way. 

    This is what I alluded to [here](https://reddit.com/comments/17pqdjw/comment/k8b5x2s) when I wrote that no matter how blissful those experiences are, they are like torture (in an *existential*, not bodily sense) compared to the result of practicing the Middle Way. That's not an exaggeration, and it happens precisely because one who doesn't see the Middle Way also doesn't see the deeply rooted level of dukkha that really matters (the 4NT come and go together, as per SN 56.30) and is fully able to ignore it and focus on the superficial pleasure (or superficial equanimity) instead.

    
    >And is therefore no longer occupied with obsessing over/delighting in/sticking to whatever that is felt and thought in regard to whatever phenomena that is presently enduring?

    Pretty much. The most accurate description is, there is no longer movement *internally* despite any amount of emotional pressure that may arise, which is to say, any movement, even if you're not making active effort to contemplate anicca, dukkha and anatta, or anything for that matter. This is essentially the meaning of Ajahn Chah's "Still Flowing Water" metaphor, sadly overlooked by most of the people who are into his teachings. He also gave a simile of a person who perfectly understands how monkeys are, and is therefore no longer invested in trying to get the monkey to behave differently. He remains at ease no matter what the monkey does. He said this explicitly in the context of training the mind, and the wrong expectations people usually have about samadhi, that it's about suppressing thoughts and similar.

    ("The monkey" obviously refers to the moods, feelings and thoughts that one learns to be undisturbed by, not to one *committing actions* rooted in lust or aversion on account of those phenomena. That already means being "baited" by  the monkey's tricks).

    >Is it where that 'immediate level' and 'reflexive level' come into play, where the disagreeable feeling linked to having to deal with someone else's bodily fluid would be at the immediate level, whereas not resisting the disgust would be at the reflexive level?

    You could put it that way. The immediate level is where the feeling is experienced (the object); the reflexive level is where you either try to get rid of it or endure it rightly.

    Of course this alone is not the same as you *understanding* that feeling is not self, that it's not "in you", because that would be the Right View. But if you refrain from acting out of feelings long enough through the context (yoniso manasikāra) that you heard and took on (parato ghoso, the utterance of another), which is that they are part of the experience you can't ultimately control, you would eventually see for yourself that that's the way it is.

### Avoiding Pride From Attainments



- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/17qnt8c/avoiding_pride_from_attainments/k8gf3gg/)** _2023-11-09 03:34:43:

    Regarding your comment above:

    >As far as my arguments go, I realized very early in my interactions here that my views are not welcome and can not be defended. 

    Perhaps you are confusing the fact that your views will most likely be met with counterarguments by default if they are discrepant with HH views (since this is an HH subreddit) with you not having the freedom to present your position.

    You may jump to that conclusion given that members might start downvoting, falling into a more personal attack and start launching borderline _ad hominems_ instead of merely refuting the relevant views and ideas, but ultimately that's every person being responsible and free with regard to the intentions behind their actions.

    It should just be clear that speaking out of ill-will and attacking people personally, in case that's what you've experienced here in the past, is not in line with HH views at all, hence not all that people say here should be taken to be representative of those views.

    Everyone is free to attempt to defend their views as much as they can in the face of the counterarguments that are presented, and there are no "forum rules", but, needless to say, discussion will not be fruitful and the purpose of the forum will not be served ''for whomever expects to be agreed with by default without presenting convincing evidence for their position. That applies even in mundane situations, not to mention the Dhamma.

    Also, I can't speak for everyone, but I'd venture to say that people would be more open to hearing and engaging in an argument when it's well supported, even if it contradicts their beliefs.

    >At any rate, I appreciate your invitation to have me continue to participate in this community. I run a community too and I welcome those who challenge my views in a respectful way. I’m sure you see it the same. 

    Of course, anything goes, respectfully or disrespectfully as long as there's some semblance of an argument being put forth and it's not just noise.

    >Do you have any thoughts on the sutta I posted?

    Yes, happy to share. I'm not exactly sure what is your interpretation here, but I'll proceed on the assumption that you take it to refer to a noble disciple becoming heedless and arrogant:

    It must be noted that this Sutta was told in the context of Devadatta, if you read the beginning. That's why at the end it says, "he does not become heedless and achieves *_non-occasional_* liberation, meaning that the "knowledge and vision" that person had was not at the level of irreversible, noble insight. It refers to the psychic powers like divine vision that Devadatta had acquired as a result of the 4th jhāna, because of which he became greedy, lost the jhānas of course, and never actually understood the Dhamma despite having reached such a (temporarily) purified state.

    (One must also remember that the 4 separate noble attainments had not been outlined for the majority of the Buddha's career, so in a lot of Suttas, everything he would list before Arahantship itself would still be reachable by puthujjanas, such as in this case).

    This discourse cannot possibly be referring to a noble disciple, because, as MN 7 says, one must abandon:

    
    ”Covetousness... ill-will…anger…resentment…contempt… insolence...envy...avarice...deceit...fraud...obstinacy... rivalry...conceit...arrogance...vanity… …negligence..."

    ...*first* in order to gain confirmed confidence in the Triple Gem (stream entry). These are the things that are abandoned *forever* by such a person, unlike the hindrances and sensuality that are overcome only temporarily before stream entry. This is essentially the first, coarsest "layer" of greed, aversion and delusion that leads to a bad destination, which is why its completely absent in a sotapanna, let alone higher.

    What this means is that a sotapanna or higher is incapable of, as MN 29 you quoted says "exalting themselves and disparaging others", of being condescending, patronizing, and attacking people personally to prove a point of Dhamma. That unwholesome intention simply cannot arise unless there is self-view. It would imply thinking highly of your-Self when you've understood that that self is not in your control, i.e. not your self. The only thing that you could ever be proud on account of is exactly the thing that you have come to understand and abandon, so it'd be silly, like eating vomit. Arrogance also requires you to perceive the other person you are "better than" as the owner, master of their experience, which a noble disciple would clearly know they are not.

    (MN 30 is the twin to this Sutta, and it *would* seem to be referring to a stream enterer who still hasn't attained jhānas, and becomes arrogant and heedless on account of their insight. But again, see the initial context. The Buddha was maneuvering around having to say whether the knowledge and vision of these teachers is right or not so that this Brahmin would not be displeased and dismiss his teaching too soon, and instead chose to highlight how if they were to cultivate jhānas—which none of the mentioned teachers claimed to have as far as recorded instances go—they would be guaranteed to reach *true* knowledge and vision eventually... if they don't become inwardly rotten like Devadatta, of course.)

    So, what one needs to learn to differentiate to see the line between wholesome and unwholesome in this case is the difference between disparaging *views*, or even disparaging behaviors of people under your tutelage as the Buddha did to his monks, and disparaging *people* themselves. (Note also that the Buddha had clearance to go a bit farther: you don't read about monks full-on calling names like he did, "useless man", "stupid, incompetent laywoman" etc., but he could do that without ill-will).

    Criticism of wrong views is 50% of what came out of the Buddha's mouth; personal attacks towards people are heavily discouraged:

    >“Bhikkhus, do not engage in disputatious talk saying: ‘You don’t understand this Dhamma and Discipline. I understand this Dhamma and Discipline. What, you understand this Dhamma and Discipline! You’re practising wrongly, I’m practising rightly. What should have been said before you said after; what should have been said after you said before. I’m consistent, you’re inconsistent. What you took so long to think out has been overturned. Your thesis has been refuted. Go off to rescue your thesis, for you’re defeated, or disentangle yourself if you can.’ For what reason? Because, bhikkhus, this talk is unbeneficial, irrelevant to the fundamentals of the holy life, and does not lead to revulsion, to dispassion, to cessation, to peace, to direct knowledge, to enlightenment, to Nibbāna.

    >“When you talk, bhikkhus, you should talk about: ‘This is suffering’; you should talk about: ‘This is the origin of suffering’; you should talk about: ‘This is the cessation of suffering’; you should talk about: ‘This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering. ’ For what reason? Because, bhikkhus, this talk is beneficial, relevant to the fundamentals of the holy life, and leads to revulsion, to dispassion, to cessation, to peace, to direct knowledge, to enlightenment, to Nibbāna.
    ―SN 56.9

    And, as MN 26 and others say, knowledge of what is the path is intimately linked with knowledge of what is *not* the path, so discussion of the latter is equally if not more important, and falls squarely within the topic of the Four Noble Truths. Provided it's not done in the unbeneficial manner described above.

    > So to summarize, the Buddha is saying that followers of the path should speak in positive regarding what is the path, rather in the negative of what others believe is the path but is not the path?

    Not quite. This is what I wrote:

    >So, what one needs to learn to differentiate to see the line between wholesome and unwholesome in this case is the difference between disparaging *views*, or even disparaging behaviors of people under your tutelage as the Buddha did to his monks, __and disparaging *people* themselves.__

    There is a line that needs to be recognized between talking as much as you may about what is not the path, even about the specific misunderstandings the person has, and about explicitly saying "I know, you don't know", which turns it into a verbal fight where no Dhamma will really be discussed, and the only purpose is to have the last laugh.

    That's why it's said that such conversation is unbeneficial. It's not saying that discussing what is not the path is unbeneficial, which would the Buddha saying one thing and then doing the opposite, not only sometimes, but extremely frequently. It may feel "unbeneficial" to the other person if they have developed an unwarranted intimacy with the view at hand, which is ultimately to their own detriment. But from the point of view of the speaker, the intention can remain wholesome (although one must still be mindful of it) no matter how strongly arguments are presented for as long as it doesn't turn into a "contest". And, ultimately, each person has to check their own mind to see whether that's what they're really aiming at. That's because they might be perfectly polite on the surface, but still internally be trying to win a competition and be solely interested in showing that the other party is wrong, while someone else could speak very forcefully yet not be worried about losing or winning in the end, only presenting their viewpoint.

    
    >Also, would this be contrasted in explaining flaws of a view to a third party? The Buddha says not to tell someone they do not see while I see, but what does he say about telling a third party that someone else doesn’t see while I see? 

    All of them would be wrong. When you explicitly say "I see, you don't see", it turns into a contest, as said above.

    But whether one likes it or not, the very act of offering a  counterargument in response to someone *implies* the attitude "I understand, you don't", and that is not necessarily unwholesome, because it's how dialogue works. Trying to sugarcoat one's argument does not change the fact that one is attempting to disprove the other person's beliefs, so it's more efficient to be upfront and simply abstain from attacking or offending the person directly. In this way, they will only get offended if they were unjustifiably clinging to their standpoint, which is no longer one's fault.

    >You mentioned that laypeople can attain the first three stages of attainment. 

    Absolutely.

    >So then is it the case that sense restraint need not be perfected for a layperson who has gained one of these attainments?

    Sense restraint needs to be practiced as diligently as possible so as to have a chance to attain what is yet unattained, both for the ordinary person and for one who has attained the first or second stage. Once the person reaches what was unreached, if they don't have a particularly strong sense of urgency left over, they may choose not to keep up the same degree of restraint that was required during their training period, and they may choose to remain a layperson.

    >And how, bhikkhus, is there nonrestraint? There are, bhikkhus, forms cognizable by the eye that are desirable, lovely, agreeable, pleasing, sensually enticing, tantalizing. If a bhikkhu seeks delight in them, welcomes them, and remains holding to them, he should understand this thus: ‘I am declining away from wholesome states. For this has been called decline by the Blessed One.’

    >“There are, bhikkhus, sounds cognizable by the ear … mental phenomena cognizable by the mind that are desirable, lovely, agreeable, pleasing, sensually enticing, tantalizing. If a bhikkhu seeks delight in them, welcomes them, and remains holding to them, he should understand this thus: ‘I am declining away from wholesome states. For this has been called decline by the Blessed One.’

    Yes, and "simply denigrating" is measured by the launching of personal attacks and talking in terms of "me and you", not by very forcefully tackling whatever viewpoint the person is expressing. To argue with reasoning alone, this is essentially the only way that the idea of the Buddha and notable Arahants like Ven. Mahākassapa having perfect mettā can be reconciled with their being so seemingly overbearing in their presentation of the Dhamma.

    On the other hand, "constructive conversation" is measured by the ability of the questioner to express their viewpoint clearly, and by that of the responder to show counterarguments for it that are coherent and well-justified. Not by how much the questioner may feel offended if, as said above, they have developed an unjustifiable attachment to a view. A conversation that fails to expose that "sore" when it's there would be of very little value to the questioner themselves.

I don't know if this mind map will fit with Ajahn Nanamoli's interpretation but I'm sure this could be useful. Reading this [article](https://www.jayarava.org/texts/the-spiral-path.pdf) from the same author really helps in understanding the Upanisa Lokkutara sequence.

    The issue is that even if the map were perfectly accurate, and created by the Buddha himself, being absorbed in the *theoretically correct* (in the best case scenario) content of your thoughts precludes seeing the *nature* of thoughts here and now, which is how you actually see paṭiccasamuppāda.

    So not only is it not relevant, it can even become an obstacle if one relies on detailed descriptions past a certain point. It won't be "concrete thinking" and will be abstract instead.

    The right degree of detail in explanation is simply what is necessary to point someone towards seeing that *nature* of phenomena here and now. That's the reason why the Suttas don't go further in detail than that. Not because the Buddha or the early monks were short on time.

### Stream Entry for Lay People



- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/theravada/comments/17psn98/stream_entry_for_lay_people/k8i1lhc/)** _2023-11-09 13:52:58:

    To address the general misunderstandings that seems to be prevalent regarding the video:

    It's not being claimed that jhāna results in permanent freedom from sensuality, or that one needs to be an anagami in order to enter it. This would contradict various Suttas, most notably AN 6.60 and the case of Devadatta in general, who is said to have reached the 4th jhāna and even gained psychic powers.

    The point being made is that freedom from hindrances is a state that, *although temporary*, is *complete*. To reach freedom from the hindrances, primarily sensuality, one needs to be perfectly dispassionate towards sensual pleasures of the past, present and any possibilities of them in the future (expressed as "future lives" in MN 106). It is not a state that can be reached by suppressing particular perceptions of sensual pleasures, which is what is accomplished through focusing on an object. The *possibility* of delight needs to abandoned, but it will of course come back.

    AN 3.94 shows that even a stream enterer who reaches withdrawal from sensuality as a *temporary state*, and dies during that time, will become an anāgāmi, never again returning to this world. This goes to show that it's the same extent of freedom *at that time*. It's just that the underlying tendencies cause one to fall away from it eventually, as the case described in  AN 6.60.

    Nevertheless, the point still holds that, for a person who has attained jhāna, while they may revert to sensual pleasures again (and it is obvious that this will happen, given that those who are reborn in Brahma realms without gaining noble insight eventually fall back down), their mind needs to have reached a certain extent of understanding of the nature of sensual pleasures (see AN 6.73, the 6th prerequisite for jhāna) to reach that jhāna in the first place. So, while they may return to it in theory, it is not likely for people who have been diligently cultivating the path as well, at least not for very long if they have also been gaining understanding of dukkha and the Buddha's teaching (case in point, the person in AN 6.60 disrobed but eventually ordained again and became an Arahant).

    The difference between this and the effect that what is contemporarily conceived as jhāna has is that, fundamentally, people who attain it are on average not fulfilling the 6th condition in AN 6.73. They may recognize in theory that "sensuality is bad" because they are Buddhist and the Buddha said that, but deep down it is often clear that they hold a view that sensuality is valuable, only that they may now be more careful and restrained in regard to it, and don't let it get out of hand. This is not "seeing the danger in sensual pleasures as it truly is with correct wisdom", as AN 6.73 says.

    A stream enterer also sees that danger implicitly on account of seeing the 4NT, but due to their habits and lack of a sense of urgency due to contentment with how far they've come, they may allow themselves to be weak and still engage with sensual pleasures. While they very much still have a "perversion of perception" described in the Suttas, not fully seeing the dissatisfaction of desire, it is very different from the ordinary person who does not see their own craving, and *values* desire deep down, as something that is necessary to uphold their existence. See SN 36.6 on how a noble disciple knows the escape from pain apart from sensual pleasures, while the puthujjana does not (and it is not specified that it refers to an anagami so, it would include even a lay sotapanna who still engages with sensual pleasures on the outside).

    Jhana is not a requisite of stream entry, and that notion is not in line with the Suttas. You would have to prove otherwise given the copious evidence showing the contrary.

    >Celibacy is not requisite for jhana or stream-entry

    Do you mean to say that you can achieve this sort of perspective, which is necessary to abandon the first hindrance as I mentioned above, referencing AN 6.73, while sexual intercourse is still a part of your life:

    >“And how, bhikkhus, are sensual pleasures seen by a bhikkhu in such a way that as he looks at them sensual desire, sensual affection, sensual infatuation, and sensual passion do not lie latent within him in regard to sensual pleasures? Suppose there is a charcoal pit deeper than a man’s height, filled with glowing coals without flame or smoke. A man would come along wanting to live, not wanting to die, desiring happiness and averse to suffering. Then two strong men would grab him by both arms and drag him towards the charcoal pit. The man would wriggle his body this way and that. For what reason? Because he knows: [189] ‘I will fall into this charcoal pit and I will thereby meet death or deadly suffering.’ 
    —SN 35.246

    As the Suttas quoted in the first comment on the video make clear, it is impossible for the mind to give rise to the knowledge of the Four Noble Truths if sensual passion still lies latent within one. As copiously explained in the video and my comment above, one who sees the Four Noble Truths may return to sensuality afterward, but not before the attainment has taken place. 

    As said in MN 36, a mind that is still "wet" with sensual passion cannot give rise to insight. I doubt anyone would dare to argue that their mind can be "dry" from sensual passion when they've been engaging in sexual activiry. And as that same Sutta says, it's not even enough to *externally* restrain yourself, in the way all monks are by default. The desire needs to be abandoned *internally*, which is categorically impossible when even externally you're still giving in to it.

    SN 55.5 & SN 45.8: This does not prove anything. The fact that a sotāpanna possesses sammāsamādhi does not mean that they are having pleasant meditation experiences yet (not to say that pleasure is bad, the problem is *how* did you get it), which I venture to say is what you're thinking of as "possessing sammasamādhi".

    This is proven my several Suttas, a very good example is MN 14:

    >“Mahānāma, there is still a state unabandoned by you internally, owing to which at times states of greed, hate, and delusion invade your mind and remain; for were that state already abandoned by you internally you would not be living the home life, you would not be enjoying sensual pleasures. It is because that state is unabandoned by you internally that you are living the home life and enjoying sensual pleasures.

    “Even though a noble disciple has seen clearly as it actually is with proper wisdom that sensual pleasures provide little gratification, much suffering and despair, and that the danger in them is still more, as long as he still does not attain to the rapture and pleasure that are apart from sensual pleasures, apart from unwholesome states, or to something more peaceful than that, he may still be attracted to sensual pleasures. But when a noble disciple has seen clearly as it actually is with proper wisdom that sensual pleasures provide little gratification, much suffering and despair, and that the danger in them is still more, and he attains to the rapture and pleasure that are apart from sensual pleasures, apart from unwholesome states, or to something more peaceful than that, then he is no longer attracted to sensual pleasures."

    Mahānāma was a stream enterer, and he had yet to find the joy that is apart from sensual pleasures, meaning he ad not experienced jhāna yet.

    The reason why a stream enterer possesses sammāsamādhi is because they have *acquired* the 7 enlightenment factors (absent in a puthujjana), as explained in SN 46.30, or, equivalently, the five faculties (absent in a puthujjana as shown by SN 48.12, where the lowest possible individual with 5 faculties is the sotapatti-magga).

    So, having the faculty of samādhi does not mean that the sotapanna has already learned to fully establish their mind in jhāna to the extent where it can be called an "abiding". But, because they have Right Mindfulness, again absent in a puthujjana, their simple practice of mindfulness is already partaking in the nature of jhāna, even though they may not be aware of it at the time:

    >"Bhikkhus, if a bhikkhu develops the first jhāna even for a fingersnap, he is called a bhikkhu who is __not devoid of jhāna__, who follows the Teacher's instructions, who responds to advice, and does not eat the country's almsfood in vain. What is to be said of those who make much of it?"
    ―AN 1.394

    >"Bhikkhus, if, even for fingersnap, a bhikkhu dwells contemplating a body within the body, a feeling within feelings, a mind within the mind, a phenomenon within phenomena, he is called a bhikkhu who is __not devoid of jhāna__...
    ―AN 1.402-5 (SuttaCentral Numbering)

    With the contemporary ideal of jhāna, thought of first and foremost as an experience that comes to you, not something that you *cultivate* with diligence, you cannot explain how one can cultivate jhāna "for a fingersnap". It is because of having this ability that even a stream enterer like Mahānāma who has not celibate and had never entered jhāna is said to possess sammāsamādhi.

    
    On Mv 1.14.1:

    >... gave them a progressive talk—on generosity, morality, and heaven; on the downside, degradation, and defilement of worldly pleasures; and he revealed the benefits of renunciation. When the Buddha knew that their minds were __ready, supple, without hindrances, joyful, and confident__ he revealed the teaching unique to the Buddhas

    ...which is to say, to go back to MN 36:

    >“So too, Aggivessana, as to those recluses and brahmins who __live bodily withdrawn from sensual pleasures, and whose sensual desire, affection, infatuation, thirst, and fever for sensual pleasures has been fully abandoned and subdued internally,__ even if those good recluses and brahmins feel painful, racking, piercing feelings due to exertion, they are capable of knowledge and vision and supreme enlightenment; and even if those good recluses and brahmins do not feel painful, racking, piercing feelings due to exertion, they are capable of knowledge and vision and supreme nlightenment.

    If you receive talk from the Buddha himself on the danger of sensual pleasures, then if your faculties are naturally up for the task, despite your engagement with sensual pleasures, you will be able to see sensual pleasures as a "charcoal pit" during that time at least, which will give rise to the Right View. But if you're *not* receiving a talk from the Buddha, and you've learned about the Four Noble Truths extensively, much more than these laypeople ever did, and are still not a stream enterer, it's because the mind is still not "ready, supple, without hindrances, joyful and confident" on account of *seeing the danger of worldly pleasures*, which is what these people had at that moment, not on account of a body observation technique that as nothing to do with understanding sensual pleasures.

    That means that you cannot afford to live like these people were before they talked to the Buddha, because that means you will simply continue to either maintain or increase the same sensual infatuation which is preventing you from reaching the state that these people had at that moment, of a mind "internally withdrawn" from sensuality―state which you now have to cultivate yourself, without the Buddha's help. 

    The Buddha with his teaching abilities could "dry your sticks" to use the simile in MN 36 simply by talking, if your faculties ("paramis" if you want to call it that) are sufficiently good, even if moments before that you had been keeping those sticks in the water.

    As I made sure to point out in the video: you allowing yourself to have sexual intercourse during your training period to reach stream entry, would be tantamount to the young men in this story turning their gaze to the women near them and fantasizing about them, ignoring what the Buddha was saying about the danger in sensual pleasures. The result would've been no stream entry whatsoever. 

    AN 10.92: This does not prove anything, because it simply explains how a stream enterer would avoid breaking the five precepts for their own welfare. It does not say anything about what they had to do to reach that attainment. As I also made sure to point out, a stream enterer may choose to return to the things they learned to regard as unsatisfactory and completely unworthy, if they do not feel the urgency to attain Arahantship in this very life.

    >The criteria for certain different factors of the eightfold path change depending on the ordination status of a person.

    Sure, but then you would also have to remember that whenever the Buddha talks about things like practicing satipaṭṭhāna, Anapanasati and entering jhānas, it's *also* always addressed to monks. Which would mean, according to this logic, that that does not fall within the eightfold path of a layperson, and they should not be trying to practice it.

    >A layperson can take them up if they wish to, but that's not a certificate required to practice Buddha's teachings correctly for them.

    It's not, because there are different levels of "Buddha's teachings". So yes, they can practice to lead a more wholesome life, much less unpleasant than if they'd been following any other religion or philosophy, but when it comes to permanent destruction of suffering and attainments, dispassion is the foremost factor to cultivate during one's training period towards that, and dispassion is first and foremost reflected by one's actions. There is no way around this.  

    Also, it's not about a "certificate". The whole fuss around ordination that exists in modern traditions is absolutely not what it's about. It doesn't matter whether you wear robes or jeans and whether you follow 227 rules, a majority of which were responses to social circumstances and accumulated over time, or not. People and monastics who prioritize this as the core of the practice are simply clinging to virtue and duty, which is a way in which monasticism itself can become an obstacle. So whoever tells you that being a monk makes a magical difference is wrong.

    What matters is if you are doing things that make you fall away from wholesome states or not (the foremost being dispassion, always given as the prerequisite for liberation in the Suttas) meaning that those wholesome states will not reach the necessary potency to clear your mind from obstructions and understand the Four Noble Truths. The base of your mind where freedom is developed has not the slightest clue about whether your head is shaven and your skin has an ochre robe on top of it or not. Monks in the Buddha's time, the people who he addressed the profound discourses involving things like the three characteristics, satipaṭṭhānas, and jhānas to were assumed to be people who by default did not engage in such things that diminish wholesome states. That's all there is to it.

    In fact, contrary to what many people seem to believe, our teachings are geared almost entirely towards laypeople. In my experience, there are very few monks who are willing to radically change their views after they've ordained, since their self-assessed certainty in the teaching is often a major factor in taking up the robe.

    >right/wrong actions are defined by a clear code of conduct

    This is using external habits and vows (sīlabbata), not discernment, to define what is wholesome or unwholesome, and that is a perilous view.

    >1) “Any kamma fashioned by greed, born of greed, caused by greed, originating from greed, is unwholesome and blameworthy and results in suffering. That kamma leads to the origination of kamma, not to the cessation of kamma.

    >(2) “Any kamma fashioned by hatred … (3) Any kamma fashioned by delusion, born of delusion, caused by delusion, originating from delusion, is unwholesome and blameworthy and results in suffering. That kamma leads to the origination of kamma, not to the cessation of kamma.
    ―AN 3.111

    See also MN 14, where Mahānāma, a noble lay disciple, was worried about the fact that lust continues to arise in his mind. He did not say "Well, I'm a layman still, so this is alright". Fundamentally, he has discerned his own welfare and, as anybody else, cares about it deeply, so he could not possibly believe that his external living circumstances are a justificiation for things that he knows very clearly lead to suffering. He may still continue to engage with those things, and because of his attainment, the results of it are immensely dampened compared to an ordinary person. But he could not fool himself, hence the sense of shame and fear of wrong doing which is part of the noble disciple's five faculties.

    What you describe here is a common notion taught today that results in a greater amount of laypeople (and monks) expecting they will attain stream entry than there otherwise would be, but, as is often the case, lowering the bar of entry to something cannot be done without lowering the quality of it.

    >What you are proposing about celibacy here is akin to what vegan Buddhists propose about practicing Buddha's teachings rightly; that if you eat meat you are breaking sila, and so, are not practicing the Buddha's teachings correctly.

    This is again using external criteria, and we advise against this extensively. You are not practicing the Buddha's teaching (even for a lay stream enterer who becomes complacent) if you delight in what is impermanent, suffering, and not-self, by body, speech, and mind. Particularizing it any more than that is something we would heavily discourage, and leads to lust and aversion ultimately being justified in subtle ways, shown by how you often see such vegans being very much devoid of mettā, and how you see monks ultimately having attachment for things like tradition, renown, and offerings because "whatever monks do as long as they keep the 227 rules is wholesome".

    Edit: Regarding what I wrote about our teachings being geared at lay people, I will add that so far I have never met a monk who agrees with our teachings who was not inspired to ordain on account of them from the beginning. So even they find the insistence on restraint and dispassion very unpalatable.

    Also, edited the passage "what you describe here is a common..." to make it more accurate.

    We have [in the past](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xor6zqSrdG4) also spoken about how recollection of the Triple Gem and of virtue and generosity constitute the "pleasant abidings here & now" that a noble lay follower who only keeps the five precepts is capable of attaining, and that the jhānas require stricter restraint than that. This is supported by the Suttas, as the article shows.

### (Video) Stream Entry for Laypeople

    > I rather get into pleasure jhanas and find insight into no-self that way. 

    This is the nuance that's so often missed. Complete abandonment of sensuality, the first and most basic that you absolutely need to grow all the others from is *__the__* "pleasure jhana", to the point where even the most peaceful bliss that you will get on account of a technique is pure torture in comparison, even if it's supposedly the "20th jhāna" or what have you and you're in cloud nine.

    It's just that that true, unfathomable bliss has a bare minimum price, and if you see it being offered for less, it will always be a cheap plastic knock-off that doesnt' even resemble it, but that the masses who don't know better are content with.

    >Bhante in this video I understand that for the right view one needs to abandon sensuality or devalue it but isn't that the state of jhana?

    A confusion many are likely having I suppose. 

    Practically you could put it this way: as a puthujjana, you need to work to mentally try to abandon sensuality *completely* (obviously having established restraint and so on). Tell yourself you're trying to become an Arahant, nothing less.  That's why I said in the video that you can't justify to yourself delighting in stuff because "a stream enterer might still desire this". They *could*, but you need to tell yourself that that's none of your business at this time (i.e. for however many years it takes you to get there). What you're shooting for is complete dispassion.

    (With this I don't mean you absolutely need to sell your house or external things like that. Primarily it means externally you don't break the 8 precepts; internally you don't delight in unwholesome).

    What will happen is, you will obviously not succeed, but over time you will have purified your mind from the hindrances to the degree necessary to get the Right View (which, yes, is a lesser degree than jhāna). But if you allow yourself delight with a view that a sotapanna can still have it, you won't reach even that temporary freedom from hindrances.

    That's why MN 106 which I referred to in the essay several times says you need to reflect about the danger in sensuality not just here and now but "in lives to come" (which you could just interpret as "in the future" in the absolute general sense). It's just how the mind and purification work in general. It's never about what you're actually wanting right now, it's about how much you *could* even remotely want things. 

    To the degree there is room for future wanting, your mind is *presently* defiled, and actual unwholesome actions in the present are just the "icing on the cake".

    Let me know if that still doesn't make sense, it's not exactly an easy topic, and yet it's crucial.
- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/17pqdjw/video_stream_entry_for_laypeople/k8gp8eb/)** _2023-11-09 05:00:52 *(in reply to a comment not included)*:

    > To me it seems like this fits the description of jhana but it also contradicts the fact that jhana is a higher degree than sotapatti?

    Whether it's somewhere in the direction of jhāna or not would depend. 

    A person can go as far as rectifying their views fully in accordance with the Suttas, understanding that jhāna is attained on account of virtue, celibacy restraint, learning to reflect rightly, having recognized the futility of the offered "shortcuts", and yet *still* be off. And even a tiny bit of being (excrement) smells just as bad as a lot, as that Sutta says.

    The stuff we spend most of the time arguing in favor of like celibacy and sense restraint, is more like just to bring back people from way back in the "minus" range to point 0, where they can actually *start* going in the "plus" direction, and from there onwards there are still numerous pitfalls to avoid.

    So, going back to my reply above, what I would advise in this case, since I can't judge based only on what you've said, is that you completely disregard any notion of pleasure *including* the pleasure of renunciation that you think you may be getting. You don't allow yourself to be delighted on account of *anything* that you become aware of, including what you might think is the pleasure of enlightenment.

     As I clarified [here](https://reddit.com/comments/17owo0t/comment/k82c6qd), jhāna is an entirely different "plane" that is invisible from one's current point of view, so it is perfectly possible for one to practice renunciation within the "plane" of kāmabhāva, i.e. the hindrances, and for it to be pleasant and for the world to feel not worth it anymore. So only by applying the attitude of "this is not worth it" towards *everything* is there a chance that you are actually addressing that entire "plane" that you exist within.

    > I am not a sotapana but I am having very pleasurable moments born of seclusion and even accompanied after some time with even more intense pleasures.

    What you need to ask yourself here is what exactly is that "seclusion". If it's because you are thinking about the *same things* that used to cause delight and now delight isn't there, then it may be worth cultivating. If it's because you are now having "only" thoughts about renunciation and that feels good, but thinking about sensual objects without delight is not possible, then it's probably better to investigate your motivations more carefully. That would still be "off-balance".

    >the fact that jhana is a higher degree than sotapatti?

    Entering and *abiding* in the pleasure born of withdrawal from the five hindrances takes more strength of yoniso manasikara than sotapatti does, evidenced by how a sotapanna cannot reach it initially. But in the end, it's better not to even think of jhāna as an "experience" you are trying to get, and instead regard it as just the cultivation of a context, i.e. *a meditation*. 

    All the pleasure and gladness are utterly secondary to that context, and they manifest only to same exact degree that the context is there. So your only concern is the context of danger in anything agreeable here and now. What comes out of the context eventually is "none of your business". Only then can that pleasure not be craved for despite its arising.

    Edit: Also, don't think of pleasure of renunciation as an "intense" pleasure, because that's likely to be within the sensual domain still (like how people get quasi-orgasms and tremble or whatever during meditation). Think of it as an *existential* pleasure, like you would feel if you just dodged a bullet. Or, to use the simile of the Suttas, you were about to be thrust into a charcoal pit and you managed to avoid it, or you had a huge debt and you managed to pay it off. The existential pleasure in the mind comes first, the bodily stuff is second. Usually for people it's the other way around.
- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/17pqdjw/video_stream_entry_for_laypeople/k8nkz9b/)** _2023-11-10 15:17:49 *(in reply to a comment not included)*:

    Yes, this is likely to be used in support of the idea that laypeople do not need to hold themselves up to the same standard as monastics if they wish to *practice towards* Nibbāna when they do not partake in it yet.
     
    "Verified confidence" can be described in a very relevant way in this context by how a noble lay disciple like Anāthapiṇḍika in this passage has perfect, unshakable and complete confidence in the fact that, as I mentioned in the video, the abandonment of sensuality and cultivation of dispassion is ultimately for nothing other than their own welfare, despite the fact that they are choosing not to go that way on account of a (fully conscious) complacency. 

    Due to their uncompromising trust in the Buddha's teaching, backed by the best evidence anyone could ask for which they see in themselves, such a person would have no issue whatsoever accepting the fact that their present way of living is not fully in accordance with that teaching, without feeling the slightest resentment towards it, nor ("subconsciously") trying to alter IT and bring IT "closer to them" so that they can feel at ease with whatever way they decided—according to their personal view, which has clearly been dragging them through samsara without beginning—is the best way to live their life. They would be able to hold both the thoughts (1) "Nibbāna is the highest, and nothing else is of any value" (2) "I will continue to enjoy these mundane pleasures" *at the same time*, an ability which, for anybody lower than them, is not within range.

    Also, the ordinary person's inability to accept that the abandonment of sense pleasures is for nothing other than their welfare is precisely what is referred to in the Sutta you quoted as "distrust towards the Dhamma".

    As Ñāṇavīra Thera put it best:

    >"...the *Notes* attempt to provide an intellectual basis for the understanding of the Suttas, without abandoning *saddhā* ["confidence" above.] It was, and is, my attitude towards the Suttas that, if I find anything in them that is against my own view, *they* are right, *I* am wrong. I have no reason to regret having adopted this attitude."

    —L. 61, 08-20-1963 (emphasis in the original).

    
    "Training rules appropriate for the laity" in the context of the *attained* laity that are alluded to in the Sutta you quoted means the 5 precepts and generosity, since this is what will ensure that these people not only do not partake in more than 7 existences, which is already impossible, but also spend the majority of those eons engulfed in heavenly pleasure. These people still need to be diligent with this because, if their 5 precept adherence and generosity turns deficient, they may spend most of those lives in the human realm instead and with less fortunate conditions if the results of their past actions ripen in such a way.

    The "training rules" necessary for one who aspires to "attain the unattained", and does not have a fully awakened Buddha to give them a talk perfectly catered to their dispositions, be it a layperson or a monastic, and be it the first, second, third or fourth noble attainment, or any samādhi attainment that they may desire, are these:

    >"The non-doing of anything unbeneficial, 

    >the undertaking of what’s beneficial, 

    >the cleansing of one’s own mind:

    >this is the teaching of the Enlightened.

    >[Patient endurance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jsmfGXInJc) is the foremost austerity,

    >Nibbāna is the highest, say the Enlightened.

    >He who injures another is no contemplative.

    >He who mistreats another, no monk.

    >Not disparaging, not injuring,

    >__restraint in line with the Patimokkha [8 precepts],__
     
    >__moderation in food, dwelling in seclusion,__ [AN 6.68]

    >__commitment to the heightened mind:__

    >__this is the teaching of the Enlightened"__

    —Dhammapada 183-185.

    (This was the entire Patimokkha exhortation given to the monks initially, whereas now we sit together for almost an hour and a half every two weeks listening to a dry, legal text that only barely ensures the first component of what I highlighted above, and not the others).

    If this is not followed to the best of one's ability...:

    >And how, bhikkhus, is one subject to decline? Here, bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu has seen a form with the eye [ear, nose, tongue, body, mind], there arise in him unbeneficial unwholesome states, memories and intentions connected with the fetters. If the bhikkhu tolerates them and does not abandon them, dispel them, put an end to them, and obliterate them, he should understand this thus: ‘I am declining away from wholesome states __[not "wholesome states for monks"]__. For this has been called decline by the Blessed One.’
    —SN 35.96

    Now, note also that what was mentioned above for attained laypeople looking forward to a heavenly rebirth is insufficient to ensure the true welfare of those who are not attained:

    >“What, bhikkhus, are the five shackles in the heart that he has not severed? 

    >•Here a bhikkhu is not free from lust, desire, affection, thirst, fever, and craving for sensual pleasures, and thus his mind does not incline to ardour, devotion, perseverance, and striving. As his mind does not incline to ardour, devotion, perseverance, and striving, that is the first shackle in the heart that he has not severed.

    >•“Again, a bhikkhu is not free from lust, desire, affection, thirst, fever, and craving for the body...As his mind does not incline to ardour…that is the second shackle in the heart that he has not severed. 

    >•“Again, a bhikkhu is not free from lust, desire, affection, thirst, fever, and craving for form…As his mind does not incline to ardour…that is the third shackle in the heart that he has not severed.

    >•“Again, a bhikkhu eats as much as he likes until his belly is full and indulges in the pleasures of sleeping, lolling, and drowsing…As his mind does not incline to ardour…that is the fourth shackle in the heart that he has not severed.

    >•“Again, a bhikkhu lives the holy life __aspiring to some order of gods thus:__ ‘By this virtue or observance or asceticism or holy life, I shall become a [great] god or some [lesser] god,’ and thus his mind does not incline to ardour, devotion, perseverance, and striving. As his mind does not incline to ardour, devotion, perseverance, and striving, this is the fifth shackle in the heart that he has not severed.

    >“These are the five shackles in the heart that he has not severed.

    >__“Bhikkhus, that any bhikkhu who has not abandoned these five wildernesses in the heart and severed these five shackles in the heart should come to growth, increase, and fulfilment in this Dhamma and Discipline—that is impossible.__
    —MN 16

    (This is of course not saying that one needs to be an anāgāmi in order to progress in the Dhamma. It means one must at least not be fueling the first three shackles through actions by body and speech for as long as one is trying to grow one's Dhamma-potency. There is ultimately no higher measure of  "desire, affection, thirst, and fever" than bodily and verbal actions.)

    While one may choose to argue that the two Suttas above were intended for bhikkhus only, and for laypeople the threshold of unwholesome is different, here is another that was also only intended for bhikkhus, which will surely be of relevance for whomever desires, as a layperson, to become like Anāthapiṇḍika above, who had only 7 grains of suffering left at most:

    >“Bhikkhus, without directly knowing and fully understanding the All, without developing dispassion towards it and abandoning it, one is __incapable of destroying suffering.__

    >“And what, bhikkhus, is that All without directly knowing and fully understanding which, without developing dispassion towards which and abandoning which, one is incapable of destroying suffering?

    >“Without directly knowing and fully understanding the eye, without developing dispassion towards it and abandoning it, one is incapable of destroying suffering. Without directly knowing and fully understanding forms … eye-consciousness … eye-contact … and whatever feeling arises with eye-contact as condition … without developing dispassion towards it and abandoning it, one is incapable of destroying suffering [...and so on for the other five sense spheres].
    —SN 35.26

    Lastly, what I wrote [here](https://reddit.com/comments/17psn98/comment/k8msvky) may also serve to shed some light on the topic.

    >edit: I hope it's clear that the motivation for my question is that I'm personally very much wanting  to meet the requirements listed in this sutta excerpt

        To add to this, see also this occurence in MN 37, resulting from an exchange between the king of gods Sakka and Ven. Mahāmoggallāna:

        >.Then, soon after the venerable Mahā Moggallāna had gone, the attendants of Sakka, ruler of gods, asked him: “Good sir, was that your teacher, the Blessed One?”—“No, good sirs, that was not my teacher, the Blessed One. That was one of my fellow companions in the Brahma-life, __(sa-brahmacārī)__ the venerable Mahā Moggallāna.” —“Good sir, it is a gain for you that your companion in the holy life is so powerful and mighty. Oh, how much more so must be the Blessed One, your teacher!”

        "brahmacārī" in Pāli always refers to the celibate life, in analogy to how Brahmā gods are inherently celibate due to permanently abiding in jhāna. 

        So, lord Sakka here is considered to be "a companion in the celibate life" to Arahant Mahāmoggallāna, despite the fact that moments ago he was probably engaging in the heavenly equivalent of sexual intercourse, surrounded by nymphs.

        This is because whoever has the Right View has also the ability, as mentioned in the video, to re-establish celibacy and dispassion in a fingersnap, no matter how heedless they have been—ability which the ordinary person lacks. This is how a lay stream enterer may even be able to become an anāgāmi at the moment of death if they set their minds to it and possess great wisdom, despite having been keeping only the five precepts throughout their life.

    >is that a fair description of the layman's training for Sotapatti?

    Yes, it's a fair description of a human being's training for Sotapatti.

    >which taken on properly will of necessity be developing towards yoniso manasikara and correct sati if taken on the right level

    Correct. Yoniso manasikāra, as the Buddha explained in MN 2, is about knowing what things cause the taints of sensuality, being and ignorance to increase when you attend to them, and which cause them to decrease, and then striving accordingly, which is said to lead to stream-entry (note that it talks about people in general, the word "bhikkhu" does not occur in this first section referring to the first three fetters It occurs in the next section, given that that refers to the further effort you need to make after sotapatti towards non-return, which is what complacent laypeople who already saw the Dhamma would choose not to make). Grasping at the signs and features of sense objects is the foremost way of increasing these 3 taints.

    
    >to attain stream entry, one must have (in that moment at least) total dispassion for any sensual pleasure or pains, past, present, or future.

    That's true. In addition, understanding the Four Noble Truths inherently entails, at the core level of your being, a permanently different attitude towards the entire world and experience, even in the most heedless of moments. So it's not to say that the sensual desire, aversion or negligence that would come up in a stream-enterer are exactly the same as in a puthujjana.

    That's why it is said that a sotapanna is incapable of the forms of greed, aversion and delusion that would lead them to the lower realms (or to great suffering in this very life). It's not because they *do* have the same amount of craving but it just magically doesn't result in suffering.

    This can only be understood on the basis of what we often emphasize regarding ["intentions behind one's actions"](https://www.hillsidehermitage.org/intentions-behind-ones-actions/), not on the basis of figuring out what specific actions a sotapanna would not do. People usually do this practice initially by seeking rational answers to the question of 
    "Why I am I doing this?" in terms of "this happened yesterday so now today this is what I need to do..." and such external, causal relationships. But what really needs to be discerned is, how hard is the wild animal that is the *citta* pulling towards whatever it wants, and how much would I suffer if I were not allow it to have it.

    In a stream-enterer, on account of possessing sammāsamādhi even if they've never had jhāna experiences before and never even heard that word, their mind inherently cannot "pull" as hard as the ordinary person's mind, even if externally both end up committing exactly the same action. (This is the meaning of AN 3.100 which I quoted in the video). So *whatever* they do simply cannot be rooted in greed, aversion and delusion to the same extent, even breaking the five precepts. This is a way in which not all practitioners of the Buddha's teaching are "equal", and the higher one goes, the more "wiggle room" one has to do things that for an ordinary person would be obstructions (but this never includes breaking the 5 precepts and celibacy. Such actions always are linked with suffering no matter how developed the mind of a stream enterer or once returner is, which is why an Arahant cannot do them intentionally).

    Case in point is Ven. Mahākassapa in SN 16.5, who was invited by the Buddha himself to live more comfortably than he had become used to. For a sekha bhikkhu―or worse, a puthujjana bhikkhu―this "backsliding" could easily result in hampering their progress.

    >(this would be why the holy life would be hard to live at home)

    Exactly, the fact that this expression occurs so many times in the Suttas―whenever a person with above-average interest in their own welfare heard the Dhamma―is exclusively due to real, practical considerations, not due to some ideosyncratic, romantic idealization of monasticism. Lay life is inherently a compromise for one who seeks liberation, and nobody wouldn't want to risk failing at what potentially is their last chance to understand the Dhamma even by a tiny 0.1%, in the best case scenario if they truly understood what is at stake. (This of course also applies to even forest monks being less than heedful and devoted to the training outlined in the Dhammapada verse I quoted, which is not uncommon, not just to laypeople).

    However, one can mitigate the effects of the compromise of laylife, to the point of standing a real chance of going even further in the practice than most monks, by abandoning the notion that, when it comes to *practicing towards* attainments, there is a distinction between training rules for monks and training rules for laypeople, and abandoning the view that there is such a thing as craving that will not lead to one's own harm (which, again, many monks would fail to do).

    Not necessarily. It's also important to understand that denying the world and not looking at anything, not hearing anything, not reading, not eating, etc. are *breaches* of sense-restraint, and are a form of passion, not dispassion.

    First a person should simply make sure that they are keeping the 5 precepts and celibacy perfectly, and not trying to do sense-restraint within faulty precepts, which would result in them "overshooting" sense restraint in order to compensate for not fulfilling the previous "step". This is essentially what happens in contemporary meditation retreats, where one restrains oneself far beyond what is necessary, instead of simply never acting out of lust, aversion, and distraction/delusion during or out of retreat, and recognizing that everything else is fine.

    That is essentially the "Middle Way". You develop it through celibacy and 5 precepts, and then learning to see what is unwholesome based on the intentions behind your actions, not based on whether you broke the rule of perfect silence during a retreat or not. 

    "Middle Way" does not mean to have sexual intercourse in moderation, or something along those lines. That's just the basic requirement to not fall below the threshold of a human.

    It is beneficial to learn about everything the Buddha said so as to aid one in abandoning wrong views that can often be an even more fundamental obstacle than one's attitude towards sensual pleasures (such as the view that "nothing is real", "we are all enlightened" or similar, which would tragically pass as "Buddhism"). Also, the view of "there is no mother, no father, no results of good and bad actions, etc." that the Suttas often talk about is much more deeply rooted than one may realize, present contemporarily for example in people who would think that saying "well, my mother is just subatomic particles so it's not *really* my mother" is Right View.

    One should simply understand that the reason why reading those words has not given rise to noble insight in one's mind is because of the lack of dispassion, which is what is always said in the Suttas to be the prerequisite for knowledge and vision, as I mentioned in a recent comment. You could equate dispassion with samādhi for practical purposes, as opposed to the contemporary idea of perfect focus on one object, which still perfectly allows room for very subtle passion to be present.

    >does it make sense to think that laypeople in general were far closer to the state of mind necessary for making a breakthrough to the Dhamma than people today, when even those who had enough distaste for lay life that they went forth as a monk still needed the gradual training? or did the gradual training begin after right view?

    All I've said here is not rooted in a fable-like assertion (a la Commentaries) that *everyone* would have been able to get the Right View before ordaining and practicing the Gradual Training, just that the number of people who did was evidently immensely larger than it is today. (And it because of this that there could be such a thing as an exclusively ariyan Sangha in MN 118 at what was the second largest of all the early monasteries).

    Nevertheless, yes, in many cases the Gradual Training would've begun after the Right View. In fact, in Suttas dealing with the Gradual Training like DN 2, you find a common passage:

    >Endowed with this __noble (ariya)__ aggregate of virtue (sīlakkhanda), he experiences a blameless joy within himself.

    ...after which *sense restraint* begins. I think I discussed the topic of the aggregate of virtue in the Sīla is Samādhi essay. It's the sort of thing that these laypeople who had done no Gradual Training at all would immediately acquire by gaining the Dhamma-eye. In fact, it's pretty much guaranteed that such people, like Anāthapiṇḍika for example, did not even know how to practice sense restraint correctly yet. Stream entry does not immediately reveal all aspects of the practice. If you read DN 10, you see that sense restraint onwards is actually part of the aggregate of samādhi, not virtue (samādhikkhanda), which means that this is what the stream enterer has to start working on to free themselves from the remaining 2 lower fetters.  

    >I ask because I have had the view that the gradual training is what leads from puthujjana, through Right View, all the way to arahant, and the training is the same whether lay or ordained. if I'm right, where in the training does Right View fit in? if I'm wrong, how should we understand the gradual training?

    Right View is not part of the Gradual Training *technically*. It is pretty much the only guarantee that you'll ever be training correctly, but that doesn't mean nobody could do it without the Right View to any degree. Case in point is the Buddha's former teachers, Bāhiya and even Devadatta.

    You can think of the Gradual Training as that which *develops* your mind. Hence, for a person whose mind was already developed to the point where a mere *explanation* of the danger in sensuality would lead to the right type of gladness and samādhi, they do not require any Gradual Training at all, and if they are content with their attainment, they will not undertake it (yet). The samādhi they would be able to get from then onwards by reflecting on the Triple Gem is essentially of the same "strength" as what they already had before attaining, not enough to constitute jhāna, but certainly a form of pleasant abiding.

    The Gradual Training is about nothing other than increasing one's proficiency in samādhi. That's why it makes no mention of learning and study for the sake of abandoning wrong views, or of what one would contemporarily call "insight practice". DN 25 goes into how *everything* all the way from virtue and restraint to the first two knowledges gleaned from samādhi deserves to be called "asceticism and scrupolosity" (tapojigucchā), a concept popular with the followers of other sects, meaning that they could technically reach it in the ideal scenario. See also what the Buddha says towards the end of what type of person he would easily and quickly be able to bring to Arahantship. The Gradual Training is also developing such  qualities in oneself to the extent they were not there.

    
    So, you could say that if a person today has not achieved the Right View by listening to the same type of teaching that these people had access to, it's because their mind is far from a mundane form of samādhi that would be sufficient for knowledge and vision to arise. Not sure where I exactly I wrote that, but I mentioned recently that samādhi could effectively be equated with dispassion, and  dispassion is the condition for knowledge and vision to arise, as lots of Suttas say.

    Now, of course, those people who had enough samādhi to be dispassionate towards sensuality as the Buddha explained it's dangers were not *acting* dispassionately before that necessarily. What needs to be remembered there is that ultimately passion cannot be measured by one's external actions, but by the un-tameness of the mind (although in the ultimate sense of the Arahant, certain actions do become impossible of course, i.e. intentionally breaking the five precepts with celibacy). 

    "Un-tameness" of the mind meaning, say, how much someone like Anāthapiṇḍika or Visākha would've suffered if they'd *had* to be celibate for a prolonged period of time when they had no Right View yet, even if they never actually did it. The intensity of that suffering is guaranteed to have been less than for the people who could not get the Right View after hearing the Buddha.

    Edit: fixed typos.

### Not able to find some sutta

Many a time some suttas are quoted by Bhikhu Nyanmoli but I  cant find them.

Can we list some popular suttas that he mostly refer.

The one I am not able to find  but frequently quoted are : 

 (1) ' sotapanna knows that he knows.'

(2) ' when buddha  explains nibbana to putthujana, they cried, saying its almost like a death'

&#x200B;

I will add if I recollect some more such case. and also would like you to add If any you remember.

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/17plw1o/not_able_to_find_some_sutta/k86kq8j/)** _2023-11-07 06:24:49:

    (1) The Pāli expression is "jānaṁ jānāti, passaṁ passati". It could also be translated as "knowingly knows, seeing-ly sees", with the same meaning. Usually it's watered down to 
    "really knows and really sees". A few examples:

    >“Bhikkhus, those ascetics or brahmins who do not understand as it really is ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering’—they look up at the face of another ascetic or brahmin, thinking: ‘This worthy is surely one who knowingly knows, who seeingly sees.’

    >“Suppose, bhikkhus, a tuft of cotton wool or kapok, light, wafted by the wind, had settled on an even piece of ground. An easterly wind would drive it westward; a westerly wind would drive it eastward; a northerly wind would drive it southward; a southerly wind would drive it northward. For what reason? Because of the lightness of the tuft.

    >“So too, bhikkhus, those ascetics or brahmins who do not understand as it really is ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering’—they look up at the face of another ascetic or brahmin, thinking: ‘This worthy is surely one who knowingly knows, who seeingly sees.’ For what reason? Because they have not seen the Four Noble Truths.

    >“But, bhikkhus, those ascetics or brahmins who understand as it really is ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering’—they do not look up at the face of another ascetic or brahmin, thinking: ‘This worthy is surely one who knowingly knows, who seeingly sees.’

    >“Suppose, bhikkhus, there was an iron pillar or an Indra’s pillar  with a deep base, securely planted, immobile, unshaking. Even if a forceful blast of wind comes—whether from the east, the west, the north, or the south—that pillar would not shake, quake, or tremble. For what reason? Because the pillar has a deep base and is securely planted.

    >So too, bhikkhus, those ascetics or brahmins who understand as it really is ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering’—they do not look up at the face of another ascetic or brahmin, thinking: ‘This worthy is surely one who knowingly knows, who seeingly sees.’ For what reason? Because, bhikkhus, they have clearly seen the Four Noble Truths. What four? The noble truth of suffering … the noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering.
    ―SN 56.39

    Another Example:

    >His fellow monks esteem him thus: ‘This venerable one lives in dependence on the Teacher or on a certain fellow monk in the position of a teacher, toward whom he has set up a keen sense of moral shame and moral dread, affection and reverence. This venerable one surely knowingly knows and seeingly sees.’ This quality leads to affection, respect, esteem, concord, and unity.
    ―AN 8.2

    (2) 
    >Venerable sir, can there be agitation about what is non-existent internally?

    >”There can be, bhikkhu, ” the Blessed One said. “ Here, bhikkhu, someone has the view: ‘That which is the self is the world; after death I shall be permanent, everlasting, eternal, not subject to change; I shall endure as long as eternity.’ He hears the Tathāgata or a disciple of theTathāgata teaching the Dhamma for the elimination of all standpoints, decisions, obsessions, adherences, and underlying tendencies, for the stilling of all formations, for the relinquishing of all attachments, for the destruction of craving, for dispassion, for cessation, for Nibbāna. He [137] thinks thus: ‘So I shall be annihilated! So I shall perish! So I shall be no more!’ Then he sorrows, grieves, and laments, he weeps beating his breast and becomes distraught. That is how there is agitation about what is non-existent internally.
    —MN 22

    And obviously one should note that one doesn't need to be thinking such course thoughts like "I shall be permanent" to have that view. It's enough to not see the Dhamma, 4NT,  impermanence of the five aggregates, etc. The only other alternative for a puthujjana is to think "I shall be annihilated", which again doesn't have to be a coarse idea. The idea will be subtly implied even in your understanding of the Suttas. When the puthujjana imagines what an Arahant is for example, their mind, their background context that is unseen, interprets that as "*there is no self* anymore for the Arahant", *even* if they've heard and intellectually agree with the fact that that's wrong. They just can't help it until they actually see the Middle Way and cease to be puthujjanas.

    So these are just the two subtle, peripheral, unrecognized attitudes that  one will have towards the aggregates at any given time by necessity. Once recognized, they can't be there anymore.

### Extent of sensuality

I used to read passages on sensuality on how one delighted in the senses, and thought I understood the extent of the meaning within my experience. However, all this time, I’ve only been focusing on sexuality, and now other obvious things have become apparent. Delighting in loved ones *appearing* happy, smiling, laughing; delighing in *listening* to their content and soft voices — all of this is sensuality.

This became apparent to me as I kept reminding myself to get out of the “safe spot” within my experience right now by reminding myself of the fact that I need to train myself to be strong enough to be able to ordain. As I kept doing this today, every time, the possibility of not seeing loved ones happy; *seeing* them crying, *hearing* them crying, became more and more apparent and painful. Repetitively reminding myself of ordaining felt like I was being pulled out of this shelter I reside in, not having access to that shelter feels terrifying, to the point where it felt like my actual physical heart was getting pulled somehow.

This shelter, its existence, was not at all apparent to me. I wonder all other such shelters that aren’t apparent to me; what are they? How are they found? How does one not even create any more such shelters? How does one become comfortable without them?

There is a “visible“ duality within my experience: ignore that I need to ordain, or not ignore that. Ignoring that is seeming to be the most convenient and non-challenging option, that’s the “safe spot” I was referring to. Literally everything within my experience becomes far more comfortable as a result. However, not ignoring that is absolute terror here-and-now.

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/17phqqf/extent_of_sensuality/k86mzmb/)** _2023-11-07 06:51:56:

    >This shelter, its existence, was not at all apparent to me. I wonder all other such shelters that aren’t apparent to me; what are they? How are they found? How does one not even create any more such shelters? How does one become comfortable without them?

    That's the catch. You can't "count" them or measure them because it's an entire *domain of existence*. It's infinite. That's why, to flog a dead horse, a meditation technique and its resulting pleasure don't actually address the problem, even though it seems to remove all the potential "shelters" you might have created and it feels like you're perfectly independent from the world internally. You're not for as long as that entire domain of false safety in pleasure is not fully discerned and abandoned.

    But yes, by restraining yourself from the specific ways of taking shelter that you start recognizing, obvious sensuality in terms of the precepts first and foremost, other ways that were not apparent before will come to light, and that over time starts to outline the entire domain.

    Before that entire domain is seen, even pulling your eyes out, living naked under a bridge and refusing to eat and breathe will be another form of "taking shelter".

    >There is a “visible“ duality within my experience: ignore that I need to ordain, or not ignore that. Ignoring that is seeming to be the most convenient and non-challenging option, that’s the “safe spot” I was referring to. Literally everything within my experience becomes far more comfortable as a result. However, not ignoring that is absolute terror here-and-now.

    That may potentially be a good sign. It could mean that you're not misconceiving it to be a magical escape from your problems. It's not.

    If you're practicing rightly, your true problems become amplified and fully visible *when* you ordain, and that's why it's the best environment to address them. 

    But if you end up using it as another "shelter", it might be worse than lay life in some ways, because the shelter can be made more comfy on a subtler level. Meaning, you start to avoid all *existential* disturbances, like being with other monks who have different views or interpretations of the rules, or being shown less-than-perfect respect as a senior monk. So you become even more existentially delicate rather than the opposite.

### New Essay: "What The Jhānas Actually Are"



- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/17owo0t/new_essay_what_the_jhānas_actually_are/k82c6qd/)** _2023-11-06 13:13:54 *(in reply to a comment not included)*:

    > from Keren Arbel and in a scholarly way her analysis supports the understanding of Jhanas you've put forth in your essay.

    Yes, I came across that one. It was not bad, relatively speaking. But if you read closely, you'll see that she still thinks "thinking" is somehow in and of itself an obstacle. It's hard for people to abandon that notion, because that's when you get in the realm of *actually* having to become dispassionate towards the entire world correctly (which is experienced *through* your thinking, nothing else), not run away from it.

    
    >I have a question : in your personal experience or overall in people's experience abiding/practicing in those correct Jhanas, does the experience of each of the four jhanas clearly distinct from one another ? __Is there a distinct feel/taste/knowing change when the mind goes from one to another ?__

    Most definitely, to the point where "distinct feel" would be an extreme understatement. This is another one of the huge discrepancies in the common understanding of jhāna, where it's basically just "absorbed... even more absorbed... even more absorbed..." and people use the term "deep samādhi" to describe it―a contradiction in terms, and carries the connotation of *digging yourself further into a hole* so you have even less perspective, whereas samādhi is all about *going up, elevating* the mind.

    All the terms and "factors" the Suttas use to describe each jhāna are usually just being read into the experience of being "locked" into the object, worsened by the fact that you're not supposed to be able to reflect while you're in the supposed "jhāna" or you will lose it, which means you can't even soberly recognize what phenomena are present (which, contradictorily, is exactly what Sāriputta was doing in *every* single attainment in MN 111). 

    So in the end, what people are going through in those "jhānas" is not actually changing all that much. It's just different perceptions coming up that are regarded as "special", __and that's why the experiences vary from person to person.__ Also, there is an inherent but subtle craving to get "more" and you get bored if you just do the same one forever, which shows how it's not even free from longing, the first hindrance. (With even the basic first jhāna, despite all that thinking and pondering, it's *inconceivable* to want or need anything, whether worldly or "spiritual", which is why it's sufficient for Arahantship.)

    When you ascend from an actual jhāna to the next, you're ascending into an entirely different *plane of existence*, literally. (This is why there's one separate Brahma realm for each jhāna, and the beings in a lower one are completely unaware that there is a higher realm―a higher jhāna―than theirs, like the Brahma Baka in MN 49, who genuinely thought he was the foremost in the entire universe. These are not random fairytales).

    So, a higher jhana is not just "different" from the previous one. Comparing them as two objects is impossible because you can only *exist* within one of them at any time. In other words, your thought of a jhāna while your not in that jhāna is __*not*__ that jhāna; it's a thought within your current plane of existence. You can't "relate" to the second one while you're in the first, and while you're not in jhāna at all, you can't even relate to the first one. That's why we say the hindrances are your *state of being* too; they're not things you temporarily get rid off by suppressing your thoughts.

    
    >"Bhikkhus, there are these four inconceivable matters that one should not try to conceive; one who tries to conceive them would reap either madness or frustration. What four? (1) The domain of the Buddhas is an inconceivable matter that one should not try to conceive; one who tries to conceive it would reap either madness or frustration. (2) __The comprehension-sphere of one in jhāna (jhāyissa jhānavisayo) is an inconceivable matter__ … (3) The result of kamma is an inconceivable matter … (4) Speculation about the world is an inconceivable matter that one should not try to conceive; one who tries to conceive it would reap either madness or frustration. These are the four inconceivable matters that one should not try to conceive; __one who tries to conceive them would reap either madness or frustration.”__
    ―AN 4.77

    
    With the modern "jhāna" you can very much  conceive it and imagine what it's like before experiencing it without reaping madness or frustration, because it's just "remove the thinking, add a fixed object and the ecstatic pleasure". And you can *crave* for it sensually as well because it's just another experience within the same sensual realm you were born into. Whatever you reach there will still be sensual, even on a very subtle level, no matter how peaceful and liberating it feels.

    (See also AN 3.94, which says that a noble disciple cannot be reborn in the sensual realm if he dies while his mind is established in the plane of the first jhana. That's because his citta is *already not here* while he's alive, so to speak, despite still having the same functioning 5 senses. The jhānas are called *"superhuman states"* as well, and you lose your monkhood forever if you claim to have them when you know you don't. They're no joke, and they most certainly don't happen by accident during a 10-day retreat).

    >How do they get to stream entry without being celibate or restraint? I thought it's only possible to attain right view after certain amount of time being restrained. And I thought that's what Ajahn Nyanamoli said too, I've always been confused about this tbh.

    During your *training period* to get the Right View you must be restrained and celibate (and for them the conversation with the Buddha was enough training due to less dust in their eyes than people today). 

    *After that*, some stream enterers with less samvega would relax and go back to only five precepts because they're content with what they attained. There are several examples in the Suttas. Pretty much every lay disciple you read about who didn't become an anāgāmi was because they weren't celibate *after* they got the Right View and were not really striving to renounce further than that. And that's why they didn't get jhānas, not because they lacked focusing skills.

    I made a video on this topic which should be released soon on the channel.

    >And second, everytime someone gets the noble attainment, they always claim they know birth is ended, etc. I'm sure during Buddha's time, not all of his student believe in the metaphysical teaching and cosmology or about rebirth etc.

    That's because you first need to know what being and birth are (which requires seeing paṭiccasamuppāda here-&-now), and then you can know when they're no longer there. Birth is not the external event of coming out of your mother's womb―that's a result of your birth already, and that same birth remains there to this day.

    
    When you understand the nature of craving, you see exactly how it necessarily *has* to have been leading you through samsara without beginning, and will do so forever if you don't abandon it, even if you have no recollection whatsoever of previous lives or divine visions.The idea that there could be a beginning to samsara, and an end that would come *by itself* (i.e. you die as a puthujjana and it's over) becomes no less ridiculous than saying that there can be a circle which is not round. It's not a matter of "believing" it anymore. 

    When you see craving and birth in yourself, you see that it's inconceivable for a new body to be imposed on you if there is no craving, and also inconceivable that you were truly just "thrown into this world" and there was nothing before this.

    But yes, until then one will only be philosophizing and inferring things through reasoning, because there is no recognition of the Four Noble Truths, and whatever conclusions one may come to will not be beyond doubt, even if they agree with what the Suttas say.

    Also, truly "metaphysical" are religions which talk about God being completely beyond our grasp and so on. The "cosmology" of the Suttas and rebirth sounds "metaphysical" only because the mind is not developed, and it cannot help but interpret everything based on the 5 sense domain, like a scientist.

    One doesn't have to "believe" in rebirth to start the  practice, but one certainly must not *be sure* that there is nothing after death, because that would be rooted in an unjustified assumption to an even greater degree, and it's inherently impossible to prove it. It would also abolish the reason for practicing and not being heedless to begin with, which is that you don't know if your actions will have repercussions later. 

    A person who is "sure" that there is no rebirth and also agrees with the Four Noble Truths and unsatisfactoriness of the world is obliged to kill themselves so as to be logically consistent, and thus achieve "Nibbāna".

    So whoever practiced rightly and got the right view at least initially recognized that they can't be sure, and therefore they better do the things which they can see in this very life lead to less craving and thus less suffering.

    >Is it possible that people who recollect past life or gained psychic powers just a saying to mean other thing but not actually meaning they really see their past lives or gain psychic powers?

    No, not to that extent. Sure, sometimes when the Suttas talk about things like how many monks where there or what the Buddha did right after coming out of the womb (with gods holding an parasol over his head, he walked several steps and proclaimed his supremacy over all beings), they might be just exaggerating or embellishing things, but that applies only to those little details about external events.

    When it comes to descriptions of things that Arahants can see and so on, things that are related to the mind and its development, none of it is made up.

    But again, one doesn't have to believe it initially if one's opposing *belief* in science and materialism is still too strong, because even if you choose to fully take on faith things like the visions of past lives, you would still be misconceiving them and adding mystical connotations to them which are gratuitous. You won't see the Middle Way of how they are within exactly the same context as the important stuff until you *have* that context to begin with.

    In fact, the Suttas always say you need to have fourth jhāna in order to gain all these special powers and whatnot, and even the first jhāna is already inconceivable from the POV of a sensual person, as I wrote in the other reply to u/obobinde above. So trying to conceive how these things that are a byproduct of skill in the fourth jhāna work, being still a sensual person with a tiny mind, is even more futile. 

    One just has to be careful not to *decide* that they're false, giving way too much credit and trust to one's present understanding of the world which *has* to be faulty.

    >The suttas are clear about jhana developed by a still mind.

    Not debatable in the slightest. 

    But I would ask you to show me evidence that the Suttas define "still mind" as the absence of thinking, particularly in the first jhāna which was the main focus of the essay. A mistaken interpretation of the first jhāna inherently makes a true second jhāna and beyond impossible.

    I will gladly engage in discussion on this topic, but I do not expect anyone to be able to disprove my points. I am convinced that whoever attempts to do so will be the sort of person with a tendency to use their pre-existing views as the lens for looking at the Suttas, rather than using the Suttas to form their views.

    Yes, I was pretty much just waiting for someone to bring this up.

    We have addressed this talk multiple times in the past, and essentially the ["process"](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=9voIhZij5Io) of purifying the mind that we always describe is entirely based on this Sutta. (See also ["Good Thoughts, Bad Thoughts"](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=VBiB0W7U6FQ).

    The first thing to note is that there is an Chinese Agama parallel which gives us a clearer picture of the process that the Sutta is describing:

    >Practicing in this way, I went and stayed in a __remote and secluded place__ [not mentioned by the Pali version and it's obviously important, since otherwise people think "group meditation" is feasible yet it's an oxymoron], practicing diligently with a mind free of negligence. 

    >[If] a thought without sensual desire arose in me, I at once realized, “A thought without sensual desire has arisen, which is not harmful to myself, not harmful to others, not harmful to both, which will [lead to] developing wisdom without diff i culty, and to attaining nirvana.” On realizing that it was not harmful to myself, not harmful to others, not harmful to both, and that it would [lead to] developing wisdom without diff i culty and to attaining nirvana, I rapidly developed it and made much of it. 

    >Again, [if] a thought without ill-will, . . . [or] a thought without cruelty arose in me, I at once realized, “A thought without ill-will, . . . [or] a thought without cruelty...

    >__[If] a thought without sensual desire arose in me, I intentionally kept on thinking it. [If] a thought without ill-will, . . . [or] a thought without cruelty arose, I intentionally kept on thinking it.__

    >I [then] further had this thought: “If I __intentionally keep on thinking__ my body will lose strength and my mind will be troubled. Let me rather keep my mind in check within, continuously dwelling in inner tranquility, unified, having attained [composure], so that my mind will not be troubled.” Thereafter I kept my mind in check within, continuously dwelling in inner tranquility, unif i ed, having attained concentration, and my mind was no longer troubled. 

    
    And what does "kept in check within mean"? Does it mean no thinking?

    >[If] a thought without sensual desire arose in me, __I further [allowed] thoughts to arise that were inclined toward the Dharma and in accordance with the Dharma.__ [If] a thought without ill-will, . . . [or] a thought without cruelty arose, I further __[allowed] thoughts to arise__ that were inclined toward the Dharma and in accordance with the Dharma. Why was that? 
    __[Because] I did not see that countless evil and unwholesome states would arise because of [such thoughts].__
     
    >It is just as in the last month of autumn, when the entire harvest has been collected, a cowherd boy sets the cows free in the uncultivated fi elds and is mindful of them, thinking, “My cows are there in the herd.” Why is that? Because the cowherd boy does not see that he would be scolded, beaten, or imprisoned for any trespassing. For this reason he is mindful of them thus, “My cows are there in the herd.” 

    >In the same way, [if] a thought without sensual desire arose in me, I further [allowed] thoughts to arise that were inclined to the Dharma and in accordance with the Dharma. [If] a thought without ill-will, . . . [or] a thought without cruelty arose...

    >Monks, in accordance with what one intends, in accordance with what one thinks, the mind takes delight in that. If a monk often thinks thoughts without sensual desire and abandons thoughts of sensual desire, then because of often thinking thoughts without sensual desire his mind takes delight in them. 

    >If a monk often thinks thoughts without ill-will, . . . [or] thoughts without cruelty, and abandons thoughts of ill-will, . . . [or] thoughts of cruelty, then because of often thinking thoughts without ill-will, . . . [or] thoughts without cruelty his mind takes delight in them.

    >With the calming of [directed] awareness and [sustained] contemplation, with inner stillness and mental unif i cation, he dwells having attained the second absorption, which is without [directed] awareness and [sustained] contemplation and with rapture and happiness born of concentration.
    ―Madhyama Agama 102, the Discourse on Thoughts

    __[note that very last paragraph: *the Buddha was already in the first jhāna when he was "allowing thoughts to arise"*]__

    Along the same lines, if you read the Pali version closely:

    >Rattindivañcepi naṁ, bhikkhave, anuvitakkeyyaṁ anuvicāreyyaṁ, neva tatonidānaṁ bhayaṁ samanupassāmi. Api ca kho me aticiraṁ __anuvitakkayato anuvicārayato kāyo kilameyya.__ Kāye kilante cittaṁ ūhaññeyya. Ūhate citte ārā cittaṁ samādhimhāti. So kho ahaṁ, bhikkhave, ajjhattameva cittaṁ saṇṭhapemi sannisādemi ekodiṁ karomi samādahāmi. Taṁ kissa hetu? ‘Mā me cittaṁ ūhaññī’ti. 

    The prefix "anu-" here adds a nuance to the words vitakketi and vicāreti, namely the fact that during that initial "stage" of cultivating the right thoughts, one is *actively* "going along" with those wholesome thoughts in order to make sure that their context remains, since "letting go" of them at that stage would entail the unwholesome ones coming back whether you like it or not. (As the talks I linked explain, this is NOT to mean that the wholesome thoughts are simply about attending to a different "object". Wholesome thoughts are developed by bringing to mind the same objects and experiences that would bring up unwholesome states, but then recognizing the true nature of them and the harm that __delighting__ in  those objects leads to, instead of allowing the mind to see them in the default way that goes with the grain. That recognition of true nature and harm is the reflection the Buddha was using here about lack of benefit for himself, others, etc. in *delighting* in those objects *while they're there*, and their presence is not really optional during the first jhāna, let alone before. And that's one reason why the second jhāna is so much more peaceful than the first one,  even though in the first one  the *citta* is already perfectly purified.

    So what the Buddha is saying here is that "[following] along" (anu-) even the wholesome thoughts (and note that the first jhāna factor is *vitakkavicāra*, so no "anu-" involved) will tire the mind compared to when the mind is calm without having to follow anything. When the mind is [externally scattered](https://suttacentral.net/mn138/en/sujato), it is ultimately not in its ideal, purified state, but that "external scattering" is initially (before the first jhāna is steady) not optional. So one needs be scattering the mind towards the signs of danger and lack of benefit in unwholesome states, so that eventually one withdraw the mind from *everything*, including the wholesome theme.

    What it means for the mind to be "withdrawn" is explained through a simile by the Sutta itself:

    >Just as in the last month of the hot season, when all the crops have been brought inside the villages, a cowherd would guard his cows while staying at the root of a tree or out in the open, since he needs only to be mindful that the cows are there; so too, there was need for me only to be mindful that those states were there.

    The meaning here is that once the context has been fully established through actively reflecting on it and bringing it back when it becomes muddled, there is eventually no need to sustain it. One can allow the mind to roam around wherever it wants, and the context will not be forgotten even if one doesn't think about it, and thus there can be no delight towards the same things that arose before, and there will be a profound sense of safety on account of that. This is what the Agama I quoted means with "allowing thoughts to arise that are in accordance with the [Dhamma]", meaning thoughts that the background citta has the right context for naturally without one's input, not thoughts that have a particular *content*.

    See also MN 125: 

    >“Just as, Aggivessana, the elephant tamer plants a large post in the earth and binds the forest elephant to it by the neck in order to subdue his forest habits…and to inculcate in him habits congenial to human beings, so these four foundations of mindfulness are the bindings for the mind of the noble disciple in order to subdue his habits based on the household life, to subdue his memories and intentions based on the household life, to subdue his distress, fatigue, and fever based on the household life, and in order that he may attain the true way and realise Nibbāna.

    >“Then the Tathāgata disciplines him further: ‘Come, bhikkhu, abide contemplating the body as a body, but do not think thoughts __of sensual desire.__ Abide contemplating feelings as feelings…mind as mind…mind-objects as mind-objects, but do not think thoughts of sensual desire.’

    >__“With the stilling of applied and sustained thought, he enters upon and abides in the second jhāna…the third jhāna…the fourth jhāna.__

    This is saying the same thing. Note how it says explicitly *thoughts of sensual desire* must not be there and the satipaṭṭhāna context needs to be the dominating factor instead, since that is essentially what the first jhāna is about. As SN 40.1 shows with Ven. Mahāmoggallāna, it is possible for one to be *sort of* in the first jhāna but which sensual perceptions beginning to arise again.

    But it cannot be emphasized enough that "sensual thoughts" and "sensual perceptions" here are determined by the way that the *citta* reacts to the objects of the six senses, and one needs to have grasped the hints of the mind so as to recognize where the sensuality even is. Otherwise, one will only be trying to get rid of objects which does not accomplish anything (while the actual unwholesome remains at back)―and yet even this would ultimately be less harmful than trying to stop thinking altogether.

    >Hello. The Buddha did not speak Chinese.

    And neither did he speak Pāli. Still, I would never put the Agamas over the Nikāyas. I only quote them when they enrich what the Suttas already say.

    >"**Anuvitakketi**" (which, similar to "anupassati",  refers to "close, accurate, precise, **anu**" thinking rather than papanca) **is about the thoughts of renunciation**. 

    According to whom, if I may ask?

    >This in itself refutes your own personal idiosyncratic claims that:

    >vitakka in the 1st jhana is about thoughts of renuncation/danger of sensuality

    It isn't, hence the Buddha said he stopped deliberately thinking about renunciation because that would be tiresome—that's the whole point. vitakkavicāra in the 1st jhana is about *anything*. The *mind* (citta) is stilled and unified (ekagga) in its "stepping back" from the entire domain of thinking, and the content of thoughts is now irrelevant. That is what I wrote, if you read carefully.

    >vitakka in jhana in ordinary verbal thinking

    I do not see any implicit rebuttal of the possibility of "verbal" thinking based on your argument above, which you did not back with evidence either. And what I'm describing here is not "ordinary" by the way. If I've ever used the expression "ordinary thinking" before, that is absolutely not to be understood as saying that the first jhāna is easy to attain. In fact, it's because freedom *despite* "ordinary thinking that the Buddha describes in MN 19 is __way__ harder than the type of practice you seem to be arguing in favor of below that nearly everyone would go for that instead—it's easy.

    >The very fact MN 19 uses the term anuvittaka shows anuvittaka is different to vitakka of the 1st jhana. The vitakka of the 1st jhana simply refers to the mind apprehending (moving towards) the pleasant feelings to examine/explore the feelings. This weakens the pleasant feelings so the mindfulness & wisdom already developed subtly pulls back the mind from its apprehension & exploring the feelings. __"Jhana wobble" as already explained.__

    Where is this said? Apart from Ajahn Brahm's teaching, I mean.

    
    >This is not related to the 1st jhana. The 1st jhana has ekaggata as a factor.

    So why the simile about letting the cows roam that the Buddha used? Isn't that "wobble" you speak about too subtle and insignificant compared to thinking and pondering to merit being compared with cows moving around, __and__ with the cowherd __*sitting still, at ease*__?

    Also, please note that I am not dismissing ekaggatā whatsoever. On the contrary, this definition of ekaggatā is so subtle and hard to conceive for most that it literally flies over people's heads. This is why the jhāna I am describing does deserve to be [compared to Nibbāna "in a manner of speaking"](https://suttacentral.net/9.47/en/sujato), as I mentioned in the recent thread about BB's essay. Whereas the ekaggatā that is conceived as the literal absorption in an object with the *sixth sense base* (mano), does not consititute a true development in the "higher mind" (adhicitta), a term for samādhi. Because it's *mano* that has been stilled, not the citta. Even the second jhāna are above are absolutely not about "fixed objects". That is of no use and will not teach you anything about your life and how you suffer in it, which is essentially about nothing but the movements of mano.

    The sort of ekaggatā you describe constitutes a development of a ["higher Māra's domain"](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.65/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=plain&reference=none&notes=asterisk&highlight=false&script=latin), if anything.

    >It does not roam around in wholesome thoughts of renunciation, non-ill-will & non-cruelty.

    And as I said, yes, the mind (citta), the cowherd, is perfectly still and does not go anywhere at all. It doesn't even roam in wholesome thoughts. Roaming in wholesome thoughts is the *practice towards* jhāna.

    >MN 125 does not support your own personal idiosyncratic claims. MN 125 says prior to its discussion of Satipatthana that the Five Hindrances have already been ended. Did you overlook this? MN 125 teaches in this order: ending of hindrances > practise of satipatthana > 2nd jhana. It is the Satipatthana here, rather than working to overcome the hindrances, that has been substituted for the 1st jhana. MN 125 here says: "*don’t think thoughts connected with sensual pleasures*"

    Again, here you are inserting your interpretations of what the hindrances are, unwilling to even ask yourself whether it's truly supported by the Suttas. What you're implying here is that abandonment of hindrances necessarily implies absence of thinking and pondering, and you have not shown evidence for this apart from quoting Suttas that you alone are telling me to interpret through concepts that were not even alluded to within them.

    >MN 125 here does not say: "*think thoughts connected with renunciation & perception of danger*". Satipatthana says: "*keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world*". Satipatthana does not say: "*keen, aware, and mindful, full of thinking thoughts of danger towards the world".*

    Needless to say, all of these are strawmans and it doesn't seem like you're actually engaging with my argument. 

    Nevertheless, I will just repeat that no, perfectly established satipaṭṭhāna does not entail *active* thinking in the sense that the satipaṭṭhāna would be lost if you forgot to think about danger―it does not require maintenance anymore. What MN 125 is referring to here at the usual place of the first jhāna is a still mind that recognizes *on its own*, without your volition, like the cowherd who sits quietly under the tree in the MN 19 simile,  the nature of phenomena within phenomena, in this case of the domain of thinking and pondering that is now operating freely. And because of that lack of need to interfere with the "cows", only needing to *know* that "the cows are there", as the Buddha said right before the first jhāna formula, there is an immeasurable sense of relief and safety―__*co-existing with living, moving cows*__, It doesn't say that the cowherd butchered the cows or put them to sleep.

    >To end, I suggest to read MN 35, which  is metaphor for how your ideas were smashed here, when you decided to try to debate the Buddha on Reddit.

    >*Then* ***DBistheB \[BadMouth\] the BD-son*** *— sensing that* ***Anigha-the Hillside-son*** *was silent, abashed, sitting with his shoulders drooping, his head down, brooding, at a loss for words — said to the Blessed One, "Lord, a simile has occurred to me."*  
    >  
    >***"Let it occur to you, BDistheB," the Blessed One said.***  
    >  
    >*"Suppose, lord, that not far from a village or town was a pond. There in it was a crab. Then a number of boys & girls, leaving the village or town, would go to the pond and, on arrival, would go down to bathe in it. Taking the crab out of the water, they would place it on the ground. And whenever the crab extended a leg, the boys or girls would cut it off, break it, and smash it with sticks or stones right there, so that the crab — with all its legs cut off, broken, & smashed — would be unable to get back in the water as before*. **In the same way, whatever Anigha the Hillside-son's writhings, capers, & contortions, the Blessed One has cut them off, broken them, and smashed them all, so that Anigha the Hillside-son is now unable to approach the Blessed One again for the purpose of debate**.*"*

    So I'm replying to you now just for the sake of others who may be reading, in case they may have genuinely held a position similar to yours. It looks like there isn't much hope to change your mind.

    Edit:
    >"**Anuvitakketi**" (which, similar to "anupassati",  refers to "close, accurate, precise, **anu**" thinking rather than papanca) **is about the thoughts of renunciation**. This in itself refutes your own personal idiosyncratic claims that:

    >* vitakka in jhana in ordinary verbal thinking

    >The very fact MN 19 uses the term anuvittaka shows anuvittaka is different to vitakka of the 1st jhana.

    Regarding this, I now realize maybe you're actually inadvertently arguing the very point I made, showing you either misunderstood or didn't really try to understand to begin with. What I referred to as the "anu-" component is the intentional, directed thinking towards thoughts of renunciation that becomes tiresome but is a necessary step. This word "vitakkavicāra" purely refers to thinking and pondering that has no "goal" anymore, because the goal of calming the defilements was accomplished.

    "anuvitakketi" occurs in Suttas like AN 7.61 with Mahāmoggallāna falling asleep, meaning it is something that would rouse his mind up due to its active quality. AN 3.112 describes how "anuvitakka" would be the sort of thinking directed towards unwholesome states, and it's that same sort that you use to develop renunciation, which is why, as MN 19 says, renunciation alone is tiresome compared to "just" vitakkavicāra that doesn't need to be controlled anymore.

### What to know about ordination?

I’m in first year of uni currently and half-way finishing the first term. Doing fairly well, but the level of work I’m getting here is making my study of the Dhamma nearly unsustainable compared to a year ago where I had loads of free time to contemplate many things. Not to speak of the fact that there’s an increasing level of dispassion at the horrible materialistic solution being sold to me here in the West — and would likely be the same elsewhere as well. My initial plan was to complete uni, get a remote SWE job that pays well enough to help my family, but this plan seems to be fadinf away now.

I was, and still am, hesitant of the idea of ordination due to my responsibility to my parents. I’m immensely indebted to them for all they’ve done for me and my sister, and I feel a great sense of responsibility towards them. The fact that my dad has multiple chronic illnesses that makes it hard for him to work does not help either; we’re not exactly that well off financially either, though it’s certainly sustainable. My fondness of my sister and fear of my mom’s anger and upset are also things holding me back. In general, I’m scared of confronting them about this.

However, the rate at which the redundancy of all that I’m currently doing — and missing out on possibly *actually* ending suffering, seems to be overtaking this fear, and I’d guess it’s only a matter of time where the fear of not dedicating my time entirely to the Dhamma outweighs the guilt and the general suffering of leaving my family. One thing, that I’ve just recognized today, that will help me alleviate some of this guilt is the fact that my parents have saved tons of money for me to go to university which would be of immense help to them; so rather than me wasting my time and the money on random uni courses of little relevance to me, it would be better for me and them that I not further pursue uni.

The first and only time I talked to my mom about my disinterest in materialistic values to instead pursue something that at least *appears* to be more relevant to ending my suffering did not go well AT ALL. I’m fairly rational and remain composed, but every confrontation seems to take both of these qualities away and I become unnecessarily emotional, this is especially the case with my mom for some reason. As a result, I become incapable of explaining my position well enough to her. The fact that her questions are all very emotional doesn’t help me either. I feel like I don’t have enough wisdom to rightly answer questions like, “so does this mean you don’t love me?”, “you don’t care about us?”. It is because I love my family and am afraid of suffering being inflicted upon them, and recognizing the uncertainty of all that can occur and the incapability of the materialistic pursuits to help with that to *any extent,* that I want to pursue freedom from suffering (she will most likely find a way to insert the belief that I don’t care about them as a result, anyways). But I’m incapable of answering properly, my mind becomes blank. How do I answer such questions? What do I do when telling them about possibly ordaining? There is so much fear at the questions that will be asked, and little belief in my wisdom to be capable of answering them.

I plan on telling them about this before the current term ends so that way, if I get permission, I don’t end up wasting money on the next term for uni. And to prove to myself that I’m willing to go far enough to ordain, I’ll also be keeping unbroken virtue until Jan. start (ideally more, but at least this much).

In the meantime, I want to know if there’s something I should know about ordination. Where to ordain? Are there certain periods for ordination? What is the minimum age required to ordain?

For reference, I live in Mississauga, Canada, and turn 19 next May. The local sanghas DO NOT look good; if I get in, I doubt I’ll have an ounce of seclusion since they seem to be hoarded by a bunch of visitors. The fact that they’re all right in the city doesn’t help with that either. My family just got our citizenship, and we’ll be getting our Canadian passport soon, so perhaps I can travel elsewhere. But again, getting permission already seems impossible enough, but then to convince my parents to allow me to go another country alone seems to make the situation even worse..

I’m looking at SBS Malaysia right now since it seems to offer the possibility of individual practice, and seclusion, but again, same issues as above.

I also haven’t considered what to do in the situation where I’m unable to obtain permission to ordain. I’m sure the situation will get escalated if I remain insistent on wanting to ordain and my relatives, grandparents and everyone will get involved, which will not be the easiest for me to deal with.

    Yes, it would certainly be good to make up your mind before you commit to further mundane investment, especially if those expenses will be covered by your parents. That will be one more argument in their favor in the future if you ever make up your mind to ordain, and you will regret it. (I went through a very similar situation, and luckily decided to cancel my studies right on time instead of trying to juggle both Dhamma and worldly life just to appease my parents, postponing ordination to some ambiguous "later on" that would've likely never come). You also don't know what unexpected obstacles will come up over time, and any sense of certainty is illusory.

    >But I’m incapable of answering properly, my mind becomes blank. How do I answer such questions? What do I do when telling them about possibly ordaining? There is so much fear at the questions that will be asked, and little belief in my wisdom to be capable of answering them.

    If you feel like based on their views and values there is little chance that they will sympathize with you, you have to be ready to be incomprehensible to them. You can't hope that they will "agree" with you and speak praise of your decision *before* you ordain unless they're extremely devout Buddhists (which may not even be enough). Their judgement will be clouded by the looming possibility of losing something that is very dear to them, and it's unlikely that even with the best wisdom and rhetorical skills you would be able to put a dent on their conviction, which will be mostly irrational (because that's the nature of attachment). They will be arguing from a completely different dimension than you, speaking the same language only on the surface.

    They would only be able to see the value in your choice, *if ever*, which is not guaranteed, *after* you've left, and once the irrational fear subsides and the reality sinks in that they *can* actually live without you, which right now their minds will be denying too loudly to see.

    >In the meantime, I want to know if there’s something I should know about ordination. Where to ordain? Are there certain periods for ordination? What is the minimum age required to ordain?

    19 years and 6 months to become a bhikkhu, *technically* 7 years old to  become a novice. In most places you'd be expected to spend one year as a novice before higher ordination, and, depending on the place, up to a year as an 8-precept layman prior to novice ordination.

    >But again, getting permission already seems impossible enough, but then to convince my parents to allow me to go another country alone seems to make the situation even worse..

    
    >I also haven’t considered what to do in the situation where I’m unable to obtain permission to ordain. I’m sure the situation will get escalated if I remain insistent on wanting to ordain and my relatives, grandparents and everyone will get involved, which will not be the easiest for me to deal with.

    Yes, in that regard, you would have to show your determination even more firmly, especially at this age when you're still regarded as a child. And again, be ready to face the fact that they might think you've gone completely nuts or been indoctrinated by a weird cult all of a sudden, and to make it clear that even if you stay, you will not really be "part" of the family as you were before. Not in the sense that you dismiss them rudely, but that you will no longer engage in the things and behaviors which caused them to become to attached to you and "love" you in the first place, even if you were to still support them financially. 

    If they are reasonably unselfish, they would probably not like the idea of having a bore of a son that will do nothing but work, pay their bills, and stay in seclusion the rest of the time, and may prefer to let you go instead, even if it's with the hope that you'll eventually change your mind and come back. 

    Then you just make sure that that never happens, and they may eventually, over time, come to see the whole thing in a different light. If not, then that's fine too, and saying that it's still a net win by an immeasurable margin if you make good use of the opportunity is a severe understatement.

    >What do monks do when their parents get sick?

    Can't say for everyone because it probably depends on the relationship, and in the Buddha's time it was obviously very different given the advancements in transport and communication. Back then, leaving them may have meant not seeing them again, or finding out too late when something happens to them.

    But nowadays if one is living in the same country, there would be no reason to not go and help them out, although one wouldn't usually be expected to stay permanently. There's a rule that a monk shouldn't sleep more than 3 nights in the same lodging as an unordained person.

    If living abroad then of course it's more complicated, but either way, that's one reason why it's better not to postpone it and ordain as early as possible if one has the aspiration, i.e. before one's parents even reach old age. Then there's at least some chance that you will have enough time to develop your mind in the best possible conditions, so that if push comes to shove and they *really* can't do without your support, you'll have a solid basis and your practice won't be compromised if you need to return home for their sake (and later when you yourself get old and sick as well, of course).

    If one's parents are already old or sick and in need of care then it's hard for the action of abandoning them not to be rooted in aversion/avoidance of responsibility unless one finds a way to ensure they'll be taken care of. What one then has to remember is that having to support one's parents does not in the slightest equal an excuse to ever break the eight precepts and sense restraint, so you can live like a monk while taking care of your parents, like the potter in MN 81, who even became an anāgāmi thanks to his dedication to the Gradual Training.

    
    >And what about your personal situation, do your parents have someone to care for them if something happen?

    Luckily I have a younger brother who'll be able to bear the burden by the time they're old, and I left home long before that.

    Edit: Just to be clear, with "return home for your parents sake"  above I meant helping them out temporarily if the support they need is not financial (i.e. never actually disrobing) until a solution can be found.

### Directly seeing feeling?

I can detect feelings only based on thought.if that thought is anger then feeling must be unplesant. Even immidiately after recognising thought of anger if i directly want to see feeling. I am unable.this seems like a blind mans strategy.
 Some other hints are bodily sensations at heart, head and stomouch region.

Is this my incapability, or all uses this strategy? Can i say that just like rupa we can never directly know vedana.?

    >I can detect feelings only based on thought.if that thought is anger then feeling must be unplesant. Even immidiately after recognising thought of anger if i directly want to see feeling. I am unable.this seems like a blind mans strategy.

    It is, because it's based on seeing things in the "wrong order". Your feelings are not detectable *based* on your thoughts. Rather, the things you choose to do, say or think about are a *response* to what you feel, and that's how there is lust, aversion and delusion right there-&-then, in regard to that feeling. Enduring the feeling on the right level means that whatever you do, say or think will not be proliferating the defilements, even if technically you are acting *due to* of the feeling (i.e., not *out* of it, as we say). This "enduring" would also be mutually exclusive with breaking the 5 precepts, celibacy, and aggressive speech.

    Actions and thoughts cannot occur apart from pressure/contact, but they are not unwholesome if they're not trying to *get out* of that pressure on the internal level, which is that "right level" endurance.

    >Some other hints are bodily sensations at heart, head and stomouch region.

    Not at all. These would be present on account of the "first arrow" alone, which is why it's utterly ill-advised to look for the defilements in the way your body reacts, and, the worst of all, trying to calm the defilements by calming your body. 

    The only "hints" that matter are the hints of the mind (cittanimitta), and not even in one's wildest dreams would one be able to pin those down onto bodily sensations.

    >Ok, so you mean to say that choices are prior to action,speech and thought.

    That's not what I was saying, but you could describe it that way too. Choice in the broadest sense of greed, aversion and delusion precedes even the specific things you might, do, say or think, which is why restraint is only the (non-negotiable) stepping stone to abandonment of unwholesome. But in this specific case, you only need to worry about properly restraining what you're actually doing first, including mental things like doubt.

    >so I should make choice/(intention) as the sign of feeling. and endure  that feeling.Because action/speech and thought are kamma. and I should restrain from them. rather then making them as sign of feeling.( though its not easy  but I understand )

    You should restrain from the actions that are rooted in trying to get rid of the feeling only, because those are what lead to the increase of kamma. You will have to do something whether you like it or not, even "non-doing" is a doing, so the point is to make sure that you are at least not adding more fuel to the fire.

    >I Also understand you  guys  are  not in  favor of body scan.  And I am also not scanning body  for that purpose. But its natue of Nama and Rupa. its psycho-somatic, as well somato-psychic. some of body sensation are really hints of feeling. it is external sense object but it gives hint of feeling. Not all feeling are mirrored on body.  But some intense feeling are mirrored on body. particularly the case of fear. How much ever I try but  first I notice on body( its immediate). Its way before any thought occurs. in facts thought are like this 'why I get this body sensation of fear,when there is  nothing to fear'.  Tension in body muscles are also signs of stress or unpleasant feeling. __I dont know where is choice in these cases.__

    Yes, because it's not there. You have no say in how your body reacts to things, hence it's said that the 6 senses are 6 wild animals. The choice happens when you feel something in your body and *then* you choose to act our of it, and that is always on the mental level. 

    Obviously you do feel "everything" in a sense, even bodily sensations have vedanā involved, but that's not the level that matters. It's how *you* feel about your body feeling a certain way that matters, which is what leads you to act out of greed, aversion and delusion on account of that body. 

    You will never find that choice by looking at sensations, and in fact the choice to look at sensations to find some hidden truth is already acting out of the pressure of the same body on a subtler level—pressure which is not at all revealed by any sensations you may look at.

    For a puthujjana, the body may feel wonderfully pleasant and light on account of unwholesome things, which already proves that it's not a useful criterion. And in the case of a noble disciple, the body would feel the same fear and its "sensations" if we use that term, but the mind wouldn't feel anything, which is the whole point of that first and second arrow simile.

    >So it is possible that someone when observing an arahant who is faced with a fearful situation and his body reacts accordingly to the observer it may seem like that arahant is fearful but in reality only he can know whether his mind has moved or not?

    Definitely, that's why you can't tell an Arahant externally. See for example MN 144, where an Arahant was in severe pain and about to kill himself, and other Arahants, including *Ven. Sāriputta himself*, were doubting that his mind was truly liberated. Only the Buddha was able to tell beyond doubt.

    >"I am not *afraid* of fear,

    >Our teacher is skilled in the Deathless,

    >Where fear cannot settle on―

    >By that path the monks go.

    >―Theragātha 21

    Of course, the red line that Arahants cannot possibly cross is that of *actions* rooted in fear and similar things. So for some Arahants the body/senses *could* still react to, say,  a spider if they've always been afraid of them since childhood, but they would be incapable of killing or harming it, or running away irrationally, and if there is a reason, they would be able to even pick it up *despite* the fear that is affecting the body, without suffering and being overwhelmed on account of it. Same for the case of pleasant experiences―they would perceive the pressure but be fully incapable of even *wishing* to act out of it or suffering because of how the body reacts.

    >Bhante, when a bhikkhu is thus perfectly liberated in mind, even if powerful forms cognizable by the eye come into range of the eye, they do not obsess his mind; his mind is not at all affected. It remains steady, attained to imperturbability, and he observes its vanishing. Even if powerful sounds cognizable by the ear come into range of the ear … Even if powerful odors cognizable by the nose come into range of the nose … Even if powerful tastes cognizable by the tongue come into range of the tongue … Even if powerful tactile objects cognizable by the body come into range of the body … Even if powerful phenomena cognizable by the mind come into range of the mind, they do not obsess his mind; his mind is not at all affected. It remains steady, attained to imperturbability, and he observes its vanishing.

    “Suppose, Bhante, there were a stone mountain, without clefts or fissures, one solid mass. If a violent rainstorm should come from the east, it could not make it quake, wobble, and tremble; if a violent rainstorm should come from the west … from the north … from the south, it could not make it quake, wobble, and tremble. So too, when a bhikkhu is thus perfectly liberated in mind, 
    ―AN 6.55

    That's one reason why the Dhamma is said to be "timeless". If it required you to re-condition the reactive patterns of your senses, as people usually misconceive equanimity, that would take time, and would probably never be perfectly achievable in every situation. 

    Arahantship is achieved as soon as the body is fully *understood*, not when you modify it to fit some predefined ideal. And that's why you can't even imagine it accurately, because all you can possibly imagine is your body and senses reacting in a different way, not freedom of mind in regard to the same reactions.

    (Edit: Through this you also get to see why sensuality is so unbeneficial and is the foremost obstacle, not because it's "immoral". Whether you realize it or not, you are reinforcing the bond that keeps your mind enslaved by the reactions of your body. It's completely the opposite direction of the Dhamma, and there is no progress towards Nibbana for as long as that's still there.)

    >Doesn't arahantship also take time for the craving itself to be removed from the mind? Like if a person is fully immersed in sensuality, they would take a much longer time than the person on the contrary. 

    Indeed, in the broadest sense it takes time, but that's because during that entire time the understanding is incomplete, and you are building it up. So to the exact same extent that there is understanding here-&-now (starting with the Right View), craving has decreased (and it also works the other way around in the sense that you have to restrain the craving that's already there for understanding to arise). See  SN 22.55 and -81 for the "immediately" part, though these are some of the subtlest Suttas of all, so it may not make much sense right now. But they are basically describing that complete understanding that leaves no room for craving, and having it is in and of itself the freedom. So the   "wait" is to develop it, not for it to have its effect.

    
    Craving is completely gone when you understand the tendencies of these same senses fully, and thus feel no need to get "outside" of the discomfort of those senses liking or disliking things (phassa/pressure which is always unpleasant, even towards pleasure), because you now see that it was inconceivable to "get/act out" to begin with. It was a totally gratuitous assumption that never could've fit with how things actually are.

    In SN 35.248, the story of Vepacitti alludes to that wanting to "get out", which is the one and only source of the problem, and the discomfort of the senses is the sheaf of barley being beaten. This shows how the 6 flails are not optional, it's the 7th one, the desire to *respond* to the flailing, to put it coarsely, that is the craving (that's the "second arrow"). With that, all birth, aging, death, sorrow and lamentation are gone, and the rest is "just disturbance until the body breaks apart".

    >“He understands thus: ‘Whatever disturbances there might be dependent on the taint of sensual desire, those are not present here; whatever disturbances there might be dependent on the taint of being, those are not present here; whatever disturbances there might be dependent on the taint of ignorance, those are not present here. There is present only this amount of disturbance, namely, that connected with the six bases that are dependent on this body and conditioned by life.’ He understands: ‘This field of perception is void of the taint of sensual desire; this field of perception is void of the taint of being; this field of perception is void of the taint of ignorance. There is present only this non-voidness, namely, that connected with the six bases that are dependent on this body and conditioned by life.’ Thus he regards it as void of what is not there, but as to what remains there he understands that which is present thus: ‘This is present.’ Thus, Ānanda, this is his genuine, undistorted, pure descent into voidness, supreme and unsurpassed.
    ―MN 121

    
    Also, as you brought up, the person immersed in sensuality will have a harder time developing understanding because they are that much more used to the "link" between their mind and their choices which they *are* responsible for, and their senses which do their own thing. That "link" is the "taint". So it will be that much harder to "unlink" them correctly, and the inclination to deny the senses instead will be much greater if they take up the practice, and they won't even see themselves doing that and overlooking the Middle Way.

    That's what it means to have "dust in one's eyes".

### Arahantship being put to the test?

 

I'm wrestling with the following doubt:

If we were to approach Dhamma from a purely phenomenological/existential standpoint and be only concered with its immidiate utility - namely, ceasing of suffering, without dealing with it being an appropriate wider model of reality *in toto* \- it strikes me then that for a such approach to hold water it needs to yield concrete, palpable results. I.e. it needs to produce individuals clearly and observably unable to suffer in circumstances normally conducive to suffering of the pathujjanas (torture, immolation, pathological conditions, skinning, starvation, etc.). Personally I'm unaware of any such examples (but there are sadly familiar counterexamples - the suicide due to chronic pain of Ven Ñāṇavīra Thera, noted representative of existentialist Theravada). If any of you on contrary are informed of such instances it would be of the great consolation to me to be proven wrong.

On the other hand, if we were to think of Dhamma as an objectively accurate world model regardless of the number of its recent or current successful applications, in other words good medicine just without skillful enough doctor to apply it or error-free instruction manual without attentive enough user to go through it, how would it then Dhamma meaningfully differ from usual faith-based religions? Because, it seems to me, only with the leap of faith would it be possible for one to maintain their confidence in the value of Dhamma in such scenario (or am I overlooking something?).

What are your thoughts?

    >it strikes me then that for a such approach to hold water it needs to yield concrete, palpable results. I.e. it needs to produce individuals clearly and observably unable to suffer

    Yes, to hold water *for puthujjanas*, and, as nearly every other Sutta says, the puthujjana is defined by not seeing the Noble Ones and their Dhamma, which in turn means that what they see as noble and inspiring will be misguided.

    >‘It is, monks, for elementary, __*inferior matters of behavior*__ (sīla) that the worldling would praise the Tathāgata.
    —DN 1

    > circumstances normally conducive to suffering of the pathujjanas (torture, immolation, pathological conditions, skinning, starvation, etc.).

    This issue here is the assumption that *that's* what the "suffering of puthujjanas" is. All such things are simply triggers that are particularly good at *amplifying* and *highlighting* the suffering of puthujjanas, which is the perilous contradiction in their situation of gratuitous entitlement to something that's not actually in their control (the non-arising of unpleasant feeling).

    
    >Dhamma as an objectively accurate world model regardless of the number of its recent or current successful application...

    It's not a "world model" that requires "proof", so it's not on the same footing as any other religion or philosophy. A "world model" is still underlied by ignorance, no matter how  accurate it is.

    If anything, you could say the Dhamma is the understanding of the *nature* of all models (i.e. views), which enables one to transcend *all* of them.  It's not just another view you "pick" in favor of the other alternatives—it is so only for a puthujjana, which is why they must never allow themselves to think they know what the Dhamma is (until they cease to be a puthujjana).

    On the mildest end, the proof that the Dhamma works is the lack of an emotional need in a noble disciple to defend their understanding from the criticisms of others, which will still be there for a puthujjana, even if their "model" happens to the closest possible approximation to the Dhamma in the rare, best case scenario.

    On the most extreme end, the "proof" is the inability to suffer *internally* despite how your body violently quakes and trembles while thugs are sawing your limbs off with a blunt saw, or the fact that you're doing your best to find a cure for a terminal illness.

    If a person's *mind* is emotionally engaged in any way while their body is immaculately still during self-immolation (which *is* doubtlessly happening, otherwise they wouldn't do such a foolish thing just to prove a point to observing puthujjanas), or while they endure torture externally with perfect equanimity, or while they stubbornly refuse to seek treatment for a disease for no good reason, there is absolutely no Dhamma there. That *is* just another "model", and not even a good one at that.

    Edit: See also [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/17cotlx/a_common_misconception_about_equanimity/) recent post I made.

### how to ask the right question?

How to ask the right question for everyday practice without being too mechanical and not become another method? 
How to ask the question so that we know ourself about what to do next? (It sounds contradicting since asking "what to do implying discontentment in itself") 
How to ask the right question for the right practice?

    By first recognizing that there is no such thing as a question that will always work. *Looking in the right place* to find the answers is what "works", even if the question is primitive or not as intricate as somebody else's.

    The assumption that there is such a thing as a question or way of directing your attention that is *in and of itself* right is what leads to mechanical practice, whether you're aware of it or not.

    That's why sometimes you can hear a new presentation of the same understanding of principle and it feels like it "clicks", but then eventually it doesn't anymore—because you started believing that the specific way of presenting the principle was the what made the principle clear, failing to see that it's how, by sheer chance, you were looking at the right place at that time.

    And this will keep happening endlessly until one gets the Right View, which is why it's necessary not to settle for anything *specific* that seems like it "works" until then, the most extreme example of which is a meditation/sensation watching technique. 

    Once one there is Right View, one will be looking at the right place *by default*, and any line of reflection relevant to the Four Noble Truths or anything the Buddha spoke about will be equally fruitful.

    You should be doubtfu,restless and regretful about your virtue and sense restraint if they've not been well established yet.

    But if they are, then start reflecting on how the *pressure* of doubt is not in itself unwholesome—your need to resolve it and get rid of it is unwholesome, especially when you commit unrestrained actions on account of it.

    The only way out is in learning to endure that pressure once your behavior is in check. There is no shortcut, which would only involve suppressing the pressure of doubt and any other hindrance temporarily by ignoring it in favor of something else. 

    That will not take you *beyond* doubt which is the Right View, but only cover it up.

### Acting out of delusion?

Is acting out of delusion when greed, hatred, and delusion are being discussed. the same as acting out of ignorance. As in ignoring dependent origination or ignoring the womb of the problem?

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/17lffyt/acting_out_of_delusion/k7fs9ia/)** _2023-11-01 23:50:12:

    You could say that you will only be able to *fully* not act out of greed, aversion and delusion once you abandon ignorance. 

    >“There are, mendicants, these two powers. What two? The power of reflection and the power of development. And what, mendicants, is the power of reflection? It’s when someone reflects: ‘Bad conduct of body, speech, or mind has a bad, painful result in both this life and the next.’ Reflecting like this, they give up bad conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, and develop good conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, keeping themselves pure. This is called the power of reflection.

    >And what, mendicants, is the power of development? In this context, the power of development is the __power of the trainees (sekhā)__. For when you rely on the power of a trainee, you give up greed, hate, and delusion. Then you don’t do anything unskillful, or practice anything bad. This is called the power of development. These are the two powers.”
    —AN 2.11

    That's because greed, aversion and delusion are already secondary products of ignorance, i.e. not seeing paṭiccasamuppāda, the nature of the aggregates etc. And only the insight of those things (and the signs of the mind especially) allows one to abandon defilements. Until that point, as a puthujjana, all one can do is *restrain* oneself from proliferating the defilements too far, which at least creates an opening to start addressing the underlying ignorance and trying to get the Right View. 

    That's why the Gradual Training is indispensable, even though the Dhamma and abandoning of ignorance is about a lot more than just behavior.

### Question about discerning wholesome from unwholesome action

Hello all, 

I asked  u/Bhikkhu_Anigha the below [question](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/16yjuh1/comment/k727p49/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) within a thread of a recent post, however he suggested it might be more appropriate and provide greater visibility if I post it separately, so I've copied it with very minor grammatical tweaks below (any input from others is welcome as well):

 

How are we to judge  whether an action or intention is skillful/wholesome rather than the opposite, when it seems like anything other than sitting perfectly still  and dispassionately awaiting starvation and death necessarily entails  some manner of discomfort avoidance or expectation of pleasantness? The  relevant considerations seem to me to hinge more on time-scale and balance of benefit to cost, but I'm happy to be corrected.

Example: You identified sexual intercourse above as antithetical to wholesome conduct, and obviously celibacy is a part of monastic life. On the other hand, I frequently see on the posted videos Ajahn Nyanamoli and others engaged in playing with and petting the dogs around the hermitage.  Now, obviously, sexual intercourse and caring for or playing with animals bear little resemblance in most ways. But, since I'm drawing the comparison in order to try to tease out the **principle criterion** by  which one judges such actions: Both involve voluntary interactions between two living entities that seemingly derive enjoyment from the interaction, get beneficial exercise from the act, and (assuming a  healthy relationship) sustain no obvious harm aside from potentially becoming accustomed to it in a way that would be unpleasant if the opportunity were removed.

Would the play with the dogs be unwholesome if one were to crave it and feel a loss when it's unavailable, and would consensual sex remain harmless if one were okay taking it or leaving it... or are there other factors that come into play? (If you find it inappropriate to discuss sex in the way this  question requires, please swap another example such as listening to music or anything else in its place). Thank you!

    >How are we to judge  whether an action or intention is skillful/wholesome rather than the opposite, when it seems like __anything other than sitting perfectly still  and dispassionately awaiting starvation and death necessarily entails  some manner of discomfort avoidance or expectation of pleasantness?__ 

    This is often taken to be the meaning of "never acting out of craving", and certainly for a lot of people that is the ideal of an Arahant, which makes enlightenment unachievable (which is good, you wouldn't want to attain such a thing).

    It would be more amusing than inspiring to meet such an "Arahant", in fact: they sit down to meditate, their knee starts to hurt―now they are locked in that position until it stops hurting or they starve, whichever happens first, because "they are incapable of aversion to pain". 

    People often don't realize the implications of their ideals of what enlightenment is, and that is further exacerbated by the ubiquitous view that meditation is about stopping your thinking, rather than questioning and upgrading those very ideas, for example, since they are at the very root of one's ignorance, and no amount of awareness techniques is actually affecting that root.

    >The  relevant considerations seem to me to hinge more on time-scale and balance of benefit to cost, but I'm happy to be corrected.

    Not at all. This stems from the widespread confusion of *ethics* and *morality* with what the Buddha called "kusala" (skilful or beneficial). The considerations of kusala and akusala hinge __on your state of mind alone__, regardless of what the perceived benefit for yourself and others would be in an external sense. For instance, helping another person is akusala if your state of mind is affected with anxiety and concern, even though externally everyone would say it's "good" and meritorious (which *does* depend on things like benefit to cost, etc., but merit and skilfulness are not at all the same).

    An Arahant could choose to kill themselves if they're under significant discomfort despite the fact that it is more of a net loss to others than a gain, and that action will not a tiny bit less skilful than any other externally "good" action they may do. The Buddha himself said he could have lived longer if he wanted, but he decided to die at around 80 instead, diminishing the amount of benefit he could bring to the world. See also SN 4.23 & SN 35.87, where two Arahants commit suicide on account of severe illness.

    In essence, if your mind is polluted with ignorance, __*whatever*__ you do will be unskilful, even with the best of intentions. If it's free from ignorance, __*whatever*__ you do will be skilful and beneficial, even if the entire world disagrees with it (and, as it will hopefully be clear from what follows, sexual activity is among the very few things that fall totally outside that "whatever").

    
    
    >Mind precedes all things. Mind is their chief; they are all determined by mind. If with an impure mind a person speaks or acts, suffering follows him, like the wheel that follows the foot of the ox.
    
    
    >Mind precedes all things. Mind is their chief; they are all determined by mind. If with a pure mind a person speaks or acts, happiness follows him, like his never-departing shadow.
    
    ―Dhammapada 1-2

    
    Thus:

    >Both involve voluntary interactions between two living entities that seemingly derive enjoyment from the interaction, get beneficial exercise from the act, and (assuming a  healthy relationship) sustain no obvious harm aside from potentially becoming accustomed to it in a way that would be unpleasant if the opportunity were removed.

    That is not at all the criterion. Sure, being in a healthy relationship is more *meritorious/ethical* than being in an abusive, unhealthy one, but wherever there is ignorance and craving, there is unskilfulness *because of that*, not because of how the relationship unfolds or such external considerations as "deriving enjoyment" from it and to what extent.

    Which brings me to the main point:

    Having sexual/romantic relationships *cannot* but be accompanied by a lustful mental state, which makes them necessarily unskilful and unbeneficial in the quest for freedom from suffering. There is a huge difference in the *sphere that matters* (which is by definition the one people are blind to) between that and the example you give of playing with pets or anything of such nature, even though both things are roughly on the same footing *ethically speaking*.

    To illustrate that difference: how many people in the world lose sleep over the fact that they are not allowed to pet their dog? How many people commit mass murders on account of frustration because they couldn't pet their dog? How many people would go fall into full on depression and perhaps kill themselves if one day they can't play with their pets, like they would if one day they woke up with an impaired sexual organ that was previously functional? And, last but not least, how strong would be the impulse for most people to start grasping at straws to justify how they can still pet their dog *and* practice for Nibbāna? (no offense to you personally, it happens often).

    Whether one realizes it or not, engagement in sexual intercourse requires attachment and everything unbeneficial that comes with it in order to even desire it, and it carries with it a huge amount of emotional weight, more than pretty much any other form of pleasure you can experience.

    Whether one can renounce particular sexual encounters is of absolutely no relevance. What matters is, how much will your mind kick and scream if you tell it that it will never have that __*ever again*__? Because *that's* the measure of how much attachment to it there is, and of the unskilful state of mind behind it―which will never be recognized until you actually restrain yourself in that ultimate sense. You don't even feel its presence otherwise, and you may think everything is well and good, because that's how __*ignorance*__ works. 

    It's not the lack of insight into some esoteric truth or secret that you is solved by a  special meditation experience. It's the inability to see how you are responsible for your own suffering and that it can be stopped eventually (at a hefty price initially, of course).

    And whatever practice one does *while* that deep, underlying addiction is being normalized and swept under the rug, is not actually bringing one closer to freedom from all addictions, which is the freedom from suffering. Any "peace" one can get within that is tantamount to the drug addict genuinely having a good day every now and then. Fundamentally, they're still in just as much of a bad place until they address the addiction, i.e. *actually stop taking the drug*.

    And this is why it's said in our teachings that if you keep the 8 precepts (minus the one on eating if there's a reason to break it), almost everything else can be done in moderation, when you are crystal clear that the state of mind behind it is not rooted in craving. 

    In the example of the dogs, if you know internally that you will not be affected if those dogs die or are taken from you the next moment, there is no problem at all, and it is perfectly possible for the mind to be dispassionate during that action, regardless of how it looks to others who still don't know what dispassion is.

    But if with sexual and amorous engagement in general it *seems* like you wouldn't be affected if you can't have it, yet __you still choose to engage in it__, then you are either not looking deep enough or are fooling yourself, just as you wouldn't be scratching your skin if it doesn't itch at all―it's *literally painful*.

    Sure, that itch can be present with almost any other action as well, including the dog example, but the point is, it doesn't *have* to be, and one thing for sure, scratching any other itch will not be as hindering to the application of the cure to the skin condition.
- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/17kezz0/question_about_discerning_wholesome_from/k7c9j7b/)** _2023-11-01 08:22:17 *(in reply to a comment not included)*:

    >Bhante what about if it's platonic relationship with parents, siblings or friends where we seem passionate and hug each other a lot. Can we be not affected with them dying like we do with the dogs or is it unavoidable like lust being present in sexual relationship?

    Well, in this case, it's not necessarily *because* you hug them that you are passionate, but rather, passion is there *and* you are hugging them, which is simply proliferating the passion by acting out of it.

    As I wrote, the state of mind is what determines the quality of the action, and when there is a state of mind of attachment, whatever you do will be wrong, and the *least-wrong* thing is to abstain from giving in to anything your mind may be craving, since that can at least allow you to learn how to uproot the attachment.

    If there is a truly dispassionate state of mind,  hugging a close family member wouldn't be *completely* impossible in the way sexual intercourse is, but you would likely not to it to the degree most people do, and certainly not "a lot", as you say. You would not be *wanting* it, and would do it only to not be rude, for example.

    And until one has seen for oneself what non-attachment is and gained the Right View, it's certainly better to err on the side of caution and avoid even such "platonic" actions, including even playful conversation altogether, because they will only be obscuring and increasing the passion that is already there at that stage. Especially with other humans, the emotional weight of interaction is never small, and that's just how the aggregates work.

    In fact, you would be better off not getting too close even with animals until you have learned how to be dispassionate in every conceivable scenario, see the signs of your mind,  no longer feel any displeasure at the prospect of abandoning everything you love, and are not at all afraid of sickness, aging and death. 

    Then you will be able to see what is attachment and what isn't, and at that stage you can basically do whatever the mind wants, because *the mind* is purified and does not even try to pull you into the charcoal pit of passion anymore. It refuses to go back there on its own.

    (The things that a purified mind categorically cannot have any interest in are the specific actions listed in AN 9.7).

### Is 'Rupa' external object?

Again Sorry to Ask very basic Question.

Is the Rupa in NamaRupa,/ PancaKhanda/6 dhatu same thing? or different thing?

Is that Rupa

(1) the external object that we see taste touch,....

(2) Or its my Body that's host other 4 aggregates/NAMA

"cakkhu  ca paticca Rupe ca upajjati Vinnan". In this case its obvious that  the  Rupe is external sense object. but  whether its part of  PancaKhanda/NamaRupa/6 Dhatu . that I am confused. Or is it that we only  perceive external object? So physical external Rupe is never part of  experience , instead it is represented by sanna only in the field of  experience.

History.  I asked related question in  the thread of '[Body within Body](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/176rj53/comment/k6r78dh/?context=3)'.

>^(can you draw line between 5 aggregate 4 satipatthana and NamaRupa.)  
>  
>^(can we say this secondary kaya/vedana/citta/dhamma. as 5 aggregates which is also Sense of Self for non Arhant.)  
>  
>^(so basically each experience is 5 aggregate but always contained within more fundamental existence, kaya,citta,vedana,dhamma.)  
>  
>^(OR IF NOT)  
>  
>^(And If NamRupa = 5 aggregate = 6Dhatu.then why we created 3 different representation.why sakkay is discussed in reference to 5 aggregates only, while viññanā is discussed with reference to NamaRupa. and 6 Dhatu are discussed independently.)  
>  
>^(Why PaticcaSmuppada says NamaRupa ->salayatana->vedana/(5 aggregates when NamaRupa already is made up of {Rupa+(vedana,sanna,sankhara,mansikar,cetana}.)))

For Which Bhikhu Anigha gave this reply .

>^(Any  of these different ways of looking at experience works, and the point  is not to try to draw parallels between them, which most Arahants in the  past surely wouldn't have been able to do because they didn't have  access to every single Sutta like us today.)  
>  
>^(When  you learn to see your experience as a whole properly (sign of the  mind, you don't need to label it as 5 aggregates, namarūpa and whatnot.  You simply see that the whole thing that you can control is there  enduring, standing upon something else that you have no control over.  Sakkāya will be there for as long as that is not seen correctly through  any of these frameworks that the Buddha formulated.))

On that I asked this above question on Rupa. and still waiting for answer.

NOTE : I also think that everyone should contemplate on these discussion. hence sharing this as a separate post.

    >Is the Rupa in NamaRupa,/ PancaKhanda/6 dhatu same thing? or different thing?

    Trying to figure out whether it's the "same thing" or it's a "different thing" already implies misconceiving what is, as if it's something you can just look at and examine from the outside. Rūpa is that which is "below" your experience of asking a question about rūpa, making that experience what it is, and you need to learn to *discern* it there, which is the only way to "resolve" this sort of question. 

    With "resolve" I mean to say that it will be seen to be __based on a wrong premise__, i.e. that there is a sense of self that sits outside of the experience and can "observe" its fundamental components to say whether "this rūpa" is the same as "that rūpa". 

    You will never find neither nāmarūpa, nor the aggregates, nor the 6 elements on that level that you can "compare" in that manner. All you will be comparing and analyzing is the *byproducts* of nāmarūpa, etc. *already* being there, and that is ayoniso manasikāra that leads nowhere of relevance.

    >Is that Rupa

    >(1) the external object that we see taste touch,....

    >(2) Or its my Body that's host other 4 aggregates/NAMA

    >"cakkhu  ca paticca Rupe ca upajjati Vinnan". In this case its obvious that  the  Rupe is external sense object. but  whether its part of  PancaKhanda/NamaRupa/6 Dhatu . that I am confused. Or is it that we only  perceive external object? So physical external Rupe is never part of  experience , instead it is represented by sanna only in the field of  experience.

    That rūpa is the foundation for your experience of being confused at this very moment―*that's* the level where it really needs to be seen. You could say "manañca paṭicca dhamme ca upajjati manoviññānaṁ" (in dependence on the intellect and phenomena, there arises intellect-consciousness). That has given rise to your experience here and now. And there is rūpa (earth, water, fire and air) involved in that *mental phenomenon* of being confused, to the extent that the phenomenon changes, persists, and changes-while-it-persists across time. Rūpa is the reason why even your thoughts are not yours―if the rūpa of a thought is gone (e.g. you forget what you where thinking about), you can't continue thinking it for a millisecond longer.

    Thus, rūpa has nothing to do with "external objects", which is the extreme of materialism, nor do you only perceive "only representations through saññā", which is idealism. Your *idea* of "external object" or of "representation through saññā" has its own rūpa right then and there, and by thinking that the rūpa is "out there" or *anywhere* for that matter, you will fail to see the rūpa that is manifest. 

    You can't say that rūpa is "out there" or "somewhere" because rūpa is not __in__ space. Rather, your experience of rūpa is the foundation for any notion of space whatsover.

    >I just laugh at  myself, when I read 'notion of space'.. that so true , space is a idea/ manyana.

    Just to be sure, space is also perfectly real (hence it's listed as the 5th of the elements). The notion of space is not "maññanā" (conceiving) in and of itself. The conceiving happens when you expect to find rūpa IN space, rather than seeing that space *is real*, but it's the (simultaneous) result of rūpa being there.

    You can't experience anything *apart from* space and see the "pure matter" either. Rather, when space is present (you could say perceptions, ideas, etc.) you have to discern form as the basis of it.

    You *need* to have both form and space simultaneously, but each must be put in its "right place", so to speak.

    >Ok so you equate perception, ideas etc to space?

    It's not that they're the same. Rather, space is experienced within the domain of perception, so perception is more general than space. But practically speaking, if you're trying to understand form, you could say you will find space if you recognize the domain of perceptions (and nāma in general, so contact, intentions and feelings too) as a general phenomenon, and form will be "that because of which" space is there. 

    Hence, the form is never "in" space, which is putting things "in the wrong order" as we say.

### "5" cords of sensuality

It's a stock frase we find in the suttas, I often wonder why just the 5 are mentioned why not 6. 

Why is the delight in mental phenomena not mentioned why did the Buddha make this distinction mentioning explicitly the five, or on other occasions mention in expanded form the 6 bases, objects, and consciousness.

I also commonly see people holding the view that the pleasure born of object focusing meditations is a pleasure born out side of sensuality (the 5 cords). Thus contributing to the view they have found the escape, that which is beyond sensual pleasures.

This goes along with another view I've heard, it is further more good to crave for this kind of pleasure. On the basis of the Buddha's reflection on not needing to fear jhana as it is not within sensuality shortly before his enlightenment. They also support this view by the fetter model saying rupa raga and arupa raga are later fetters so there is no need to worry about that until much later.

How does one understand why there is the distinction between 5 and 6 made? And how does one come to know that object absorption is sensuality?

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/17jr4z6/5_cords_of_sensuality/k75xiq6/)** _2023-10-31 00:21:44:

    >Why is the delight in mental phenomena not mentioned why did the Buddha make this distinction mentioning explicitly the five, or on other occasions mention in expanded form the 6 bases, objects, and consciousness.

    FIrstly, the framework of 6 instead of 5 senses *is* used in the context of sensuality many times (see SN 35.63, SN 46.6, SN 35.246).

    But the reason why it may sometimes not be mentioned is that the mind (mano) operates "in regard to" the 5 senses when it comes to anything unwholesome. You cannot have sensual desire for something you think about unless it's something you *could* see, hear, smell, taste or touch. And that's why sensuality is never about *perceiving* the objects; it's about the fact that you're __looking forward to having them with the body__ on the level of the mind. Hence the Suttas always talk about "sights *cognizable* by the eye that are agreeable, etc." when discussing the 5 cords.

    >I also commonly see people holding the view that the pleasure born of object focusing meditations is a pleasure born out side of sensuality (the 5 cords). Thus contributing to the view they have found the escape, that which is beyond sensual pleasures.

    Yes, that's a widespread idea. But the reason this is mistaken is that jhāna is not the escape from sensual pleasures in the sense that you *stop perceiving them*, it's the escape from *sensuality* in regard to sensual pleasures, and those are two different things which people often can't distinguish. 

    You can't have sensuality without sensual pleasures, but for someone who is free from sensuality, sensual pleasures still arise for as long as they still have operating 5 senses. It's not even a matter of choice that those 5 animals will perceive certain things as pleasant (which you will not engage with if you're properly restrained) because they're *not yours*. What's "yours" is your delight and lust towards that pleasure and acting out of it.

    The escape beyond sensual pleasures, as the Suttas mention several hundred times at least, is the *subduing of passion* for the five cords of sensual pleasures as a result of seeing the danger in them, not a special meditative state where you become unaware of them, and taking that to be the escape only goes to show one's lack of understanding of what the problem really is (and because of that, that "escape" is still underlied by sensuality, even if the person is not thinking about those objects at that time).

    >This goes along with another view I've heard, it is further more good to crave for this kind of pleasure. On the basis of the Buddha's reflection on not needing to fear jhana as it is not within sensuality shortly before his enlightenment. They also support this view by the fetter model saying rupa raga and arupa raga are later fetters so there is no need to worry about that until much later.

    Yes, another common misunderstanding. You cannot "crave" for jhāna in the way you can crave for objects of the 6th sense base, and whatever comes as a result of craving is by definition not jhāna. Jhāna arises when you give up craving temporarily, and that's why it takes way more development of mind than people usually think, since they take it as a "replacement" for the pleasure that they know. It's by *abandoning* all pleasure that you can think of, *including* your preconceived notions of "meditative joy", that you reach the joy and happiness of jhāna.

    It is *impossible* to be "attached" or "addicted to" the pleasure of jhāna, because it's reached by abandoning attachment and addiction.

    >Here, __with seclusion from appropriation/acquisition__ (upadhi), with the abandoning of unwholesome states, with the complete tranquillization of bodily inertia, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, a bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the first jhāna..."
    ―MN 64 

    So it's wrong to think that one can even *imagine* what rūpa and arūpa rāga refer to unless one has abandoned kāma rāga first and become an anāgāmi. All passion and desire that you can possibly recognize before that point is sensual, even if it inspires you to abandon the coarser stuff as meditation techniques do. 

    

    >And how does one come to know that object absorption is sensuality?

    Just ask yourself whether you would be annoyed if someone where to knock on your door and interrupt your meditation once you've finally achieved perfect focus on the object. With the pleasure that is truly beyond sensuality, being annoyed by even the most annoying things is impossible. Also, why is it pleasant? If it's not because you see sensual desire as a charcoal pit that you managed to escape from and thus feel immense relief (SN 35.244), it's not the pleasure born of withdrawal from sensuality, and focusing on an object precludes having the *context* of sensuality as a "charcoal pit" (or the context of anything, for that matter).

    Sure. 

    >So there is no need for going here and there through the suttas to find the answers to justify things. "Free from patchwork". 

    Exactly. It's about being honest with oneself about what is truly rooted in craving. Before getting the Right View, one by definition cannot see the full scope of what craving is, but if every single practitioner would at least apply that *mildly* accurate criterion they do have access to but  without compromises and wilful omissions, with relentless self-transparency, many of the contemporary approaches would not even exist. The  "patchwork" is always a result of such compromises.

    As the Buddha said, he does not praise or encourage even a fingersnap of being (bhava), because just a tiny bit of excrement smells just as bad as a lot ([AN 1.328](https://suttacentral.net/an1.316-332/en/)) So whoever presents nurturing of craving and attachment, even of a subtler kind, as part of the practice is going wrong somewhere.

    >is bhava/being equal to mara's domain?

    Most certainly not, in which case freedom would not be possible. An Arahant does not "destroy" Māra's domain, they abandon involvement with it (i.e., with the eye, ear, etc. and all the feelings associated with that).

    Bhava is your *attitude* of assuming the ownership of Māra's domain, which includes trying to abolish it and not perceive anything beautiful, etc., and that attitude is most acutely reflected in unrestrained actions of sensuality and aversion. So if that attitude is abandoned, there is no bhava, despite Māra's domain remaining exactly where it was.

    >"What, bhikkhus, is the Nibbana-element with residue left?

However, his five sense faculties remain unimpaired, __by which he still experiences what is agreeable and disagreeable and feels pleasure and pain.__ It is the extinguishment of lust, aversion, and delusion (=of bhava) in him that is called the Nibbana-element with residue left.

    ―Itivuttaka 44

    So the "place" where you go to escape from Māra is dispassion, which is to say that you don't actually go anywhere else. But, at the same time, the journey towards achieving that dispassion is by far the most challenging of all. It's not like "we're already in Nibbāna", as it's sometimes said.

### Seeing A Body Within The Body - by Bhikkhu Anīgha

&#x200B;

>When that simultaneous relationship is seen, whether in terms of the body, feelings, mind or phenomena, it becomes inconceivable to exercise a sense of ownership over both thing[1] and thing[2], the sum of which nothing can possibly be outside of. You now see that you cannot be that center even if you wanted to, and body[1], which is clearly not yours, becomes the “center” instead. Same principle applies to the other *satipaṭṭhānas.* They render ownership redundant and inconceivable.  
>  
>This “ownership becoming inconceivable” point cannot be emphasized enough, given that it’s possible for people to think that, because they can now apparently overcome the sense of self by “applying” some practice, they therefore have right mindfulness or became *sotāpannas.* This is not it. It is entirely out of the question for the assumption of  self and its associated suffering to ever arise again if “body within  the body”, etc., has been understood—*even* if one doesn’t do any meditation for the rest of one’s life -  Bhikkhu Anīgha, [Seeing A Body Within The Body](https://www.hillsidehermitage.org/seeing-a-body-within-the-body/)

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/17jbn8d/seeing_a_body_within_the_body_by_bhikkhu_anīgha/k722ut6/)** _2023-10-30 06:19:51 *(in reply to a comment not included)*:

    See the note I wrote at the very end. This is a different way of explaining the same principle, which Ajahn Nyanamoli usually illustrates in terms of a "container" that is more fundamental than everything in your experience, including your sense of self. I also used it myself in the Yoniso Manasikāra essay, drawing a comparison between the "womb/yoni" and that "container", seeing which there can be no notion of *me* being the first, "outside" of everything else that manifests and controlling it at leisure. Instead, "I" exists only as a result of being "nourished" by that container/womb (i.e. anything I can volitionally choose to do or even think requires my body to "allow me" to do so). 

    So, indeed, in that paradigm the thing that is "within" is the thing that is secondary, dependently arisen, and its "container" is that which it depends upon.

    I opted for this alternative description this time primarily because it appears to correspond to the Pāli most literally, which I realized through my own reading of the Suttas long ago. It works particularly well in elucidating the meaning of the Bāhiya Sutta, and it's also good because it makes it explicit that there *is* a center, which people are often all too quick to deny through various views and ways of misinterpreting *anattā*, to the point of believing that cessation of "I am" is cessation of __individuality/subjectivity__ or of agency, and thus "we are all one in the end", etc., a slipshod, misguided attempt to solve the problem of bhava, which ends up only *hiding* it. 

    This emphasizes more the fact that no matter how "internal" or "close" something feels, which there is no need to deny, it's still just as much of a mistake to regard it as yours and try to control it as something that is "out there". As a matter of fact, most of people's meditation is inadvertently about trying to control those "internal" things, such as their feelings, moods, etc., failing to see that that's another way of saying "mine".  This is why we say you need to *endure* your own "personal" moods, for instance, the way they arise and not try to replace them. People want to endure only "external" things like physical pain and bodily sensations, which hardly does anything in and of itself.

    But, as I wrote, it doesn't really make a difference in the end, because the point of both this and the "container" description is to point towards seeing  "with this, this is", which is the paṭiccasamuppāda/simultaneous dependence principle that is the only way out of the sense of self. 

    In fact, it may also be a test of one's understanding to see whether one perceives any seeming discrepancy between the two explanations/essays, which there isn't.

    Not totally sure what you mean with "verbal thinking", but I would really caution against the idea that the "voice in your head" needs to be stopped in order to gain samādhi, unless you've already mastered the first jhāna (and are thus a once-returner at the very least) and are trying to move on to the second. The first jhāna is the cessation of the possibility of *breaking into speech*, not the cessation of thinking and pondering, which is what you might be referring to as "verbal thinking". 

    That "verbal thinking" has to be *harnessed* to develop the right context, not gotten rid of, so as to withdraw the mind from sensuality and unwholesome states.
- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/17jbn8d/seeing_a_body_within_the_body_by_bhikkhu_anīgha/k7bsh6r/)** _2023-11-01 04:34:31 *(in reply to a comment not included)*:

    Absolutely. A noble disciple will remain a sotapanna *because* of their lack of skill in at least the first jhāna, and―it doesn't hurt to repeat whenever possible―lack of skill in the first jhāna is because of not knowing how to fully purify the mind from sensuality, not due to lack of success in concentrating on one object continuously. 

     Jhāna tends to be regarded as a special "state" that happens to you and is limited to that one occasion, but *in order to* enter jhāna you need to make your mind totally dispassionate and then find pleasure in that dispassion and detachment. Which means, attaining jhāna necessitates a complete transformation of your attitude towards the world, which sees passion and attachment as pleasant by default.

    That process of making the mind dispassionate through right recollection of the context of danger in sensuality (that he already sees to an extent), is exactly what a sotapanna has not completed yet, which is why by the point they succeed in that (which could take years) and thus start to abide in the first jhāna, they're well on their way to non-return already. *Mastering* it would entail being a non-returner, if not Arahant.

    >Even though a noble disciple [i.e. sotāpanna or higher] has clearly seen as it actually is with right discernment that sensuality is of much suffering, much despair, and greater drawbacks, still — if he has not attained the joy and pleasure apart from sensuality, apart from unskillful states, or something more peaceful than that — he can still return to sensuality. 

    >But when he has clearly seen as it actually is with right discernment that sensuality is of much suffering, much despair, and greater drawbacks, and he has attained a joy and pleasure apart from sensuality, apart from unskillful states, or something more peaceful than that, he cannot return to sensuality.
    ―MN 14

    (This very Sutta was given to a layman who was a sotāpanna, when he asked the Buddha why he still had unwholesome states arising for him despite having the Right View. The Buddha's reply is evidence that this person could not attain jhānas yet despite his Right View.)

    >whether I understood it or whether it was true ALSO counted on the body being first.

    Indeed. This is the only way to actually transcend the sense of self and thus the fetter of doubt, not to "figure it out" in theory. 

    It's by applying that principle in regard to  *everything*, not making an exception even for your state of confusion and lack of answers, that you find the way out of doubt and uncertainty about the Dhamma. And *then*, when you overcome all doubt in that "indirect" manner, you will recognize all the "theory" in the Suttas on the level where it needs to be seen, which means it won't be theory anymore.

### Beings are owners of their actions

In a way it’s funny the Buddha had to mention that beings are owners of their actions since beings normally regard the aggregates as mine, but this ownership doesn’t fully apply to their actions. Or rather, their ownership applies to their actions but there’s a kind of hiding mechanism from that ownership. It’s like the example Nanavira gave of the Judge giving death penalty (I think this was the example?), but excusing it as not *really their* action, since they’re just playing the role of their job. But in doing this, they forget that they were the ones who chose the job, and very well could’ve not. So the excuse doesn’t work.

Since the Buddha had to explicitly mention to us to see we genuinely *are* owners of our actions and their results, it means we *haven’t* been owning up to the full extent and are hiding the fact of our ownership somehow. I’m wondering, what are all the ways in which ownership of actions can be hidden from? Is there *a single* particular thing at fault which leads to hiding from it?

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/17d2y6a/beings_are_owners_of_their_actions/k5wirv7/)** _2023-10-22 00:13:06:

    >Is there *a single* particular thing at fault which leads to hiding from it?

    Yes, that's why accepting responsibility for actions is not *merely* about reflecting on the fact that one should, as if it were a matter of choice (at least the *complete* acceptance isn't). One needs to know the root of the issue, especially to take that responsibility to the point where it can give rise to the Right View.

    In a nutshell, there is one thing that if you learn how to do, you will always accept the right amount of responsibility even if you've never heard that expressio before. And that is, learning to endure ("on the right level", as we say) the mental displeasure which is the *result* of your past actions up to this point.

    That's because it is only possible to avoid responsibility by assuming that you have an external escape in any shape or form from that displeasure, which will automaticaly entail trying to use that assumed direction of escape to avoid that feeling.

    That "result" of past actions is not about some linear chain of cause-&-effect that has led you to your current *external* circumstances of being sick, poor, or something like that. The "result" is on the level of the wildness of the citta—how strongly it shies away from pain, and how fiercely it pulls towards the offers of pleasure.

    That wildness is brought about through the past choices of of greed, aversion and delusion by body, speech or mind that one has made, and it is through failing to pin that wildness down *this time around* and endure the tantrum that one committs more actions rooted in craving that bring about more results that you refuse to own up to and endure... and so on ad infinitum. That's saṁsāra, pretty much.

    When you make such choices, you're avoiding responsibility in the same way as you would when you're forced to take care of somebody else's dog that's been heavily spoiled prior to that. Given that it's "someone else's dog" and eventually you'll be rid of it (or so you assume), instead of actually trying to train it and subdue it's bad habits, you just give it a treat or let it go whenever it wants when it starts whining. 

    But the problem is, the dog is entirely yours, literally more than anything in the world you're have affection for, to the point where you will never be able to break away from it no matter how hard you try. Even death itself will not make you part ways.

    And, to be a broken record, seeing the signs of the mind through the Gradual Training is the first step towards "training the dog". Before that, you haven't even discerned what exactly its wild behavioral patterns are, and will just be blindly wrestling against the secondary pain that's already the *byproduct* of those patterns—potentially pissing off the dog even more while it's still not properly tied onto the leash.

    >When a sensual option has arisen for  me, and I can pursue it, I *know* I can get rid of the pressure, even if it's temporary, by pursuing it. There genuinely *does* seem like an escape externally, how does this escape not exist?

    Yes, I think this is something people would tend to get confused over. Another way of describing it that may be more useful: 

    Instead of trying to tell yourself that it "doesn't exist" in the way you're doing, acknowledge that there *is* an escape being presented to you, but now ask yourself whether it can actually provide what you're assuming it does.

    When you experience sensual desire, what you are actually wanting is to be free from pain and disturbance. So when you have a desire and you go on to "escape" the pressure through giving in, do you actually feel at ease in the way your desire was promising you, or is there a sense that when the next thing comes, you will feel even more pressure to go for it (or even that this same thing of which "just one bite" seemed like all you'd ever need, is now not enough)? Is there a sense that unpleasant things you experience are now even more harrassing than before you had given in to the pressure? Do you feel *safe* or do you feel *more vulnerable*?

    Also, does it work the same way when you engage with a sense object without desire, say, to eat when you're truly hungry and not for the sake of pleasure?

    (This will be more apparent if you had been properly restrained for a while before you gave in. If you hadn't been restrained, then you may not be able to feel the transition from wild to "wilder". And when you've been restrained for a while you don't even need to actually give in to recognize what's coming. You will feel the impending loss of control of your mind if you know how to look for it.) 

    >It seems according to what you've said, my practice of acknowledgement is entirely contrived and redundant since I'm not taking responsibility at the right place and the right time? Taking on responsibility rightly and unwholesome actions cannot both exist simultaneously? So to the extent that one is repetitively acting out unwholesomely whilst reminding themselves of the fact that *they* are doing that to pretend there is some acknowledgement of ownership/responsibility of one's action, it is actually just piling up further where *true* responsibility is?

    Yes, it's piling up the avoidance further. As I wrote, whether you've ever even *heard* the word "responsibility" before and been told you need to take it on, what truly matters is if you're able to endure the result of your past actions. That result is the extent to which the citta feels obligated to go for something that the *eye* likes and avoid something that it dislikes. 

    So pasting a label of "I'm responsible" on top of your actions is in and of itself irrelevant, because your ability to act is already what you're owning *too much* when you engage with sensuality and aversion.

    What you truly don't want to own up to, yet should be if you want to be free from kamma, is the displeasure that will occur if you *don't* committ the actions that are pressuring you. That's how you take responsibility for having willingly brought your own mind to that present state carelessly, and taking on that responsibility is what eventually "starves" the impulse to act and calms the mind down.

    As said in "The Mind Whisperer", the mind only understands the "language" of you *actually* not acting out of craving. It doesn't understand a word of English.

    >Sometimes, the pressure is so strong, there is so much mental chaos, confusion, uncertainty, pain, that it feels I'm forced to act out, that there is no other option apart from acting out. 

    Sure, that's how it feels because of the assumptions, but if you start contemplating rightly you would see that there is no such thing as true "forcing". Even if someone puts a gun on your head and asks you to do something, *you* are the one who chooses not to die and go along with the request instead. This may sound bleak and harsh, but it's actually hands-down the most liberating insight of all, that frees you from *anything* that could ever possibly impose itself on you (seemingly). 

    This connects with SN 35.228, the Sutta about the Arahant enduring the terrors of the ocean that I quote often. And a slight glimpse of that freedom is verifiable here-&-now, right where the presented "obligation" to act is, if you give up the assumption that whatever bad things will happen if you don't act out are "too much to bear"-that there is such a thing as a "too large wave". It will be so only if you choose to gratuitously decide upon a degree where "pressure is too much" that will ultimately be arbitrary, and you would be responsible for settling on any such notion.

    Of course, you don't have to try to become an Arahant in one go and renounce everything immediately, but real progress is only possible if one puts one's foot down to endure what seems like "too much", so as to not give up on the gradual commitments toward increased restraint that one already made. The mind presents things as "too much" only as a form of scare tactic so it can go back to the same dose of the drug it was getting before. If you don't let it for long enough, it will stop wanting to have it, and it will get used to the wholesome type of food you've been giving it.

    > I find myself intending to not give in, and then the next moment I find myself already engaging in that act and the intention already "changed on its own". But this doesn't just happen suddenly, it almost always occurs after I've been delighting in this sensual option for a while (over the time of some hours, or days), in some subtle sense, and then there needs to be like the right mixture of loss of context of the importance of restraint and certain level of pressure of the sensual option for this "automatic" shift in intention to occur. In these instances, I don't really feel the one responsible for starting this, yet it's precisely in these instances, as I understand what you said above, that I can truly acknowledge my responsibility/ownership of my actions; that it is entirely on me to give in and *not* do all the other possible things I could instead be doing.

    
    Exactly. The fortunate thing is, if you had been restrained beforehand, you never *actually* end up by accident at the point where not giving in feels "too painful".
    It always has to be because of the little, at the time seemingly harmless, delight and lust that you were cultivating, which was gradually inclining the mind away from restraint towards wildness again. Kind of like a small leak in your plumbing that you choose to ignore until it has caused visible structural damage to your house. 

    So you need to take responsibility for those little choices (as in, endure the pain of not making them), and then you won't ever have to worry about being overwhelmed. Endure this relatively smaller pain now so you don't have to endure the greater one later—it's a great deal, but no one wants to take it.

    >Bhikkhus, whatever a bhikkhu frequently thinks and ponders upon, that will become the inclination of his mind. If he frequently thinks and ponders upon thoughts of sensual desire, he has abandoned the thought of renunciation to cultivate the thought of sensual desire, and then his mind inclines to thoughts of sensual desire. 
    -MN 19

    "Inclining to thoughts of sensual desire" here doesn't mean the sensual *objects* arising on their own, as if the goal was to get rid of them and focus on something else to forget they exist. It means the pressure you begin to experience to act out of such objects.

    >Isn't being born in a bad environment also result from bad karma?

    It is, but it's not the aspect of kamma that matters when it comes to the practice. 

    The real vipāka that matters is the amount of greed, aversion and delusion that you have to deal with in the future and how far you will be from peace, because you can end up being born in a good environment even if in this life you were very lustful and angry. Your mind will have a greater tendency towards craving, and *that's* the reason you will suffer in your next life despite your fortunate environment.

    And if you were going in the direction of renunciation, you will suffer less if you are born in unfortunate circumstances.

    >My heart rate was up, I was agitated, and I felt a persistent need *to keep looking over my shoulder*. I felt totally, inexplicably vulnerable.

    That's how it becomes, and the amazing thing is, we spend our whole lives happily riding that feeling, to the point where we don't even recognize it anymore, and when it's not there we feel "bored". That's why the Buddha compared a sensual mind to a sick person whose perception of things is distorted.

    >This is what will eventually lead to these acts completely falling away as possibilities; the training should be leading to the trainer becoming completely redundant.

    Yes, and that's also how you start to see for yourself that "action is intention", as the Buddha said. You realize that this vulnerability only arises when *you* choose to go and pursue or delight in the pleasure. Eventually it becomes impossible to fall into self-mortification, where you think the *objects* are the problem, to any degree of subtletly (which one does in the beginning, even if one doesn't explicitly think of it that way), and equally impossible to compromise your own safety through actions.

### A Common Misconception about Equanimity

>Bhante what about gross things like poop or puke? I can't imagine it's really possible someone doesn't quiver when they see it and smell the nastiness.

This is actually not relevant and it's quite a prevalent wrong view, based on a misconception of what equanimity is (denial of the reactions of the senses), and confusing the "first arrow" (SN 36.6) to be the second. It reveals people's identification with their senses and failure to recognize the signs of the mind when they think their citta is equanimous because their body doesn't react in certain ways anymore. Like the idea that because someone doesn't flinch during self-immolation, they must be an Arahant.

True equanimity is being *internally undisturbed* when the senses react to things, be it strongly or weakly. That's the message behind SN 35.228 of "withstanding the force of the waves" and AN 6.55, which says the Arahant's mind is unmoved like a mountain *despite* the force of a violent rainstorm. Not that "there is no rainstorm anymore", which is possible only when one sheltering oneself from things. 

When the famous SN 36.6 ([see HH video on it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkwYOroXqK0&t=4)) talks about "bodily feeling", the first arrow, it's often implicitly interpreted as "bodily sensations" (because it's not uncommon to think vedanā means "sensation"). But all feeling is mental, even the bodily one, and goes as deep as where your moods are (the Sutta itself says there is "bodily feeling" in regard to the intellect). Seeing or remembering a close friend dying,  being diagnosed with a painless terminal cancer [and smelling disgusting things] are bodily feelings that are unpleasant even for an Arahant, but there is no resistance of their citta to it and thus no second arrow. The first arrow is in Māra's control, and by hoping to control it, one is in turn still controlled by him.

    >Bhante, can arahant still cry? There used to be debate about this sort of thing, because a respected teacher claims he's an arahant and he was crying when he told everyone this because he felt compassion towards everyone.

    An Arahant could cry in the case of severe physical pain, which can cause the eyes to tear up naturally, or perhaps in the case of some nervous disorder. But crying that results from wrongly attending to an emotion and taking it as mine—the type that accompanies sorrow, lamentation or despair—would not be possible, because that requires one to crave against the pain of that emotion. 

    If someone really is crying due to "compassion towards everyone", that sounds like a second arrow striking, and confusing compassion with empathy, i.e. *feeling* the pain of others, which is the *taking up* of a burden, as opposed to abandoning all burdens and wanting to help others to do so too (true, based compassion).

    > behave like every other normal human externally.

    So you can't really go as far as this when it comes to things normal people do that involve greed, aversion and delusion. 

    But certainly there are things that people, due to their own misconceptions of what unwholesome is, wrongly project into an Arahant, such as that they wouldn't be repelled by a bad smell, would be dismissive of all mundane affairs and conventions, would not recollect the past or plan for the future, would not change their posture or environment when experiencing discomfort, would always move and speak in a certain way, would not have preferences, etc.

    >Bhante let's say we have to take care of a sick person that need our help in defecating and other things. Isn't quivering and trying to look away and not wanting to see those nasty things and want the experience to be over quickly means the mind is still affected.

    Yes, if you are experiencing internal suffering and feel like you can't be at ease until the experience ends, the mind is affected. But if you experience intense unpleasant feeling yet are not afraid of the displeasure lasting forever hypothetically, then the mind is not affected. 

    But this is only possible with the Right View and beyond, and it's impossible to imagine it before that—whenever the puthujjana's mind is not affected, it's because the arisen displeasure is not actually intense.

### Doing Nothing or Contemplating

This is a question I had asked Bhante Anigha, and Bhante has advised to make a seperate thread for it, so here it is!

 My confusion has to do with whether what Ajahn Nyanamoli means by "not doing anything" has to do with literally not thinking any thoughts that arise, or whether we should actually be making an effort to contemplate and think in this period? 

I always thought what Ajahn Nyanamoli had meant by doing nothing/non-activity is that one should sit and allow thoughts to come up but not engage with or think any of them, regardless of their nature as wholesome or unwhesome. 

"Just allow your mind to come up with ideas and things to do, and then don't commit to them. Let those thoughts endure and just sit about". - The Only Way to Jhana

Contemplating still seems to be doing something - actively thinking - rather than allowing thoughts to endure and not thinking any of them at all? 

Which of these should I be doing? Actively contemplating, or not thinking any thoughts that arise and endure? The thing that Ajahn describes in The Only way to Jhana seems to be to have the benefit of increasing to one's ability to endure unpleasant thoughts and emotions, but the downside is that you are not engaging with any arising thoughts at all, as opposed to not engaging only with thoughts of an unwholesome nature, but cultivating those thoughts not of an unwholesome nature (like you would do through contemplation). 

The Ajahn Chah quote below is something that shows a bit of what I mean by actively contemplating and cultivating arisen thoughts of a wholesome nature. 

"Different phenomena may contact the senses, or thoughts may arise. This is called initial thought (vitakka). The mind brings up some idea . . . Once the mind has brought it up, the mind will want to get involved and merge with it. If it's an object that is wholesome, let the mind take it up. If it is something unwholesome, stop it immediately." - Ajahn Chah, Monastery of Confusion

Sorry for the long question and any difficulties reading my phrasing, it was a bit challenging for me to reword my reply as a seperate question.

Thank you !

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/17be6s2/doing_nothing_or_contemplating/k5mf52c/)** _2023-10-20 00:20:11:

    The answer to the confusion you have is simple: you are not truly "just allowing thoughts to come up" unless you have actively clarified the right context beforehand, because it's not a matter of choice. That "allowing" is possible only when the mind has been tamed to the necessary degree through the right context. (See SN 35.246 & MN 20).

    Instead, what you would need to do to *eventually* allow thoughts to endure is to understand (not just intellectually but concretely in your experience) what the expression "non-activity" is actually pointing to, as an example. This means seeing what the unwholesome activities that you are responsible for is and abandoning them, and that's done by seeing the sign of the mind, and right contemplations gradually point in that direction. 

    Otherwise, your attempt at "non-activity" will be about denying something that doesn't need to be denied and is not unwholesome, such as volition in regard to your thoughts.

    The problem is that usually when people try to "actively contemplate", they're just rehearsing ideas with restlessness and doubt, and when they start "just allowing things to endure", they're denying their volition and degree of real control (practicing "no-self" as opposed to "not-self"). 

    So true non-activity can only be present if you have learned how to contemplate correctly *without* falling off of the endurance of thoughts and trying to get rid of things, and learned how to endure thoughts rightly *without* losing the clarity of context which will mean you're not actually enduring them. 

    
    >"Just allow your mind to come up with ideas and things to do, and then don't commit to them. Let those thoughts endure and just sit about"

    In other words, this in itself is a contemplation, because you also need to be doing the work of clarifying what "let thoughts endure even" means (even this is not really understood by a puthujjana), not just sit back passively. The clarity of what "non-activity" is is in itself a wholesome thought that you're cultivating. Wholesome and unwholesome is not about what *objects* arise, but about clarity and lack of clarity about the true nature of things.

    One who abides in non-activity is still perfectly able to choose what to think and what not to think, recall memories, think about the future, contemplate the teachings, decide to stand up, walk or sit down, etc. (AN 3.64). What defines the non-activity is that there is full clarity on the peripheral level which remains steady *on its own* amidst the movement of thinking, volition and choice (even a very coarse choice to "actively contemplate" this or that) and that the mind is unmoved even when thinking about the most alluring or aversive things.

    
    [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9voIhZij5Io) and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBiB0W7U6FQ) explain the kind of contemplation would contribute to seeing what activities actually need to be abandoned. My [essay](https://www.hillsidehermitage.org/sila-is-samadhi/) also presents a similar line of inquiry while simultaneously highlighting the need not to misuse that inquiry to try to get rid of any arisen phenomena.

    Edit: And just to be clear, when I say "the mind is unmoved even when thinking about the most alluring or aversive things", I really mean that you're not holding anything back. You throw pure "gasoline" at the mind (the same things that would previously agitate it), and there is no possibility of a fire. This is the simile of the battle elephant in MN 125, who doesn't flinch even when threatened by spears on all sides. It's not because you're being gentle with the provocations.

    So that's the true "allowing thoughts to endure" (samatha) that one is training towards, because that's what can give rise to a mind that doesn't quiver in the face of anything, including death. One can't assume that one is already succeeding in that "allowing" before that point.

    >Bhante what about gross things like poop or puke? I can't imagine it's really possible someone doesn't quiver when they see it and smell the nastiness.

    This is actually not relevant and it's quite a prevalent wrong view, based on a misconception of what equanimity is (denial of the reactions of the senses), and confusing the "first arrow" (SN 36.6) to be the second. It reveals people's identification with their senses and failure to recognize the signs of the mind when they think their citta is equanimous because their body doesn't react in certain ways anymore. Like the idea that because someone doesn't flinch during self-immolation, they must be an Arahant.

    True equanimity is being *internally undisturbed* when the senses react to things, be it strongly or weakly. That's the message behind SN 35.228 of "withstanding the force of the waves" and AN 6.55, which says the Arahant's mind is unmoved like a mountain *despite* the force of a violent rainstorm. Not that "there is no rainstorm anymore", which is possible only when one sheltering oneself from things. 

    When the famous SN 36.6 talks about "bodily feeling", the first arrow, it's often implicitly interpreted as "bodily sensations" (because it's not uncommon to think vedanā means "sensation"). But all feeling is mental, even the bodily one, and goes as deep as where your moods are (the Sutta itself says there is "bodily feeling" in regard to the intellect). Seeing or remembering a close friend dying, or being diagnosed with a painless terminal cancer are bodily feelings that are unpleasant even for an Arahant, but there is no resistance of their citta to it and thus no second arrow. The first arrow is in Māra's control, and by hoping to control it, one is in turn still controlled by him.

    >Could this example of how I restrain myself regarding speech be taken further to the restraint of intentions to act mentally? An intention to think is present , and while it is present, neither denying it nor acting how it wants/pressures me to act, I reflect on it's nature? Basically, there is ACTIVITY, but no unwholesome activity, thus - "no activity"? 

    Yes, that's a good example that you can extrapolate to any form of pressure. You can't control how your senses react to certain people (thus it's not *in itself* unwholesome), but you become "complicit" in that reaction when you are not able to allow the displeasure to endure for as long as it wants, and are acting out of it even mentally, be it by indulging in hate or by trying to replace it with something else ("love").

    You need to be willing to endure that arisen intention to say something in anger "forever" if that's how it ends up being, as opposed to saying "no, this shouldn't be here because it's unwholesome", in which case that denial would become your activity, and you'd fail to see that the real source of dukkha is your *craving*, no matter whether it's to accept or deny the arisen intention.

    > Instead, __I use thinking neither to deny nor to proliferate the arisen intention,__ and instead use thinking to reflect on the arisen intention in order to assist my restraint and understanding.

    Indeed, that's the point I was making. You wouldn't be able to do any of this if you didn't first use thinking to recognize what exactly needs to be allowed to endure, and proceeded to just blindly "do non-activity". Furthermore, that recognizing of the intention and knowing that you should neither welcome nor deny it is all the wholesome thinking you need. You don't need to then go and try to love the person, for example, because where there is fabrication of love there will be hate (towards your own displeasure that arose on its own), and that's not wholesome. Genuine mettā would arise by itself as a result of you *enduring* the intention until you no longer care at all about its presence, not as a result of replacing it with another intention you think is better.

    Hence:

    >because if the intention didn't persist, what would even remain for me to reflect on in the first place?

    Exactly. Wholesomeness is none other than clarity and discernment of the offers of unwholesome kind while they persist. It's not in going somewhere else in the experience, as if you had an object that will magically not be underlain by craving if you just move your attention to it. Craving is always "behind" your attention.

    Truly allowing things to endure requires discernment, and discernment that isn't abstract depends on allowing things to endure.

    >Could you please confirm this is AN 3.64 that convey this idea? Because when reading it I don't find this idea, but that might be my understanding of it

    Well, it's not explicit, but the point is that if you are able to change postures, your mind is free to move in any direction. You are not locked in to some fixed state like people think. In the first jhāna at least you would be able to think about the past and future for sure, as there is no reason why certain types of vitakkavicāra should be prohibited. It's seeing the entire domain of vitakkavicāra as a phenomenon that leads you to the first jhāna, and once you see that, it doesn't matter at all *what* that vitakkavicāra is about. Memories of the past and thoughts about the future are no more special or likely to be unwholesome than the intention to stand up, for example. Both of them could equally be rooted in hindrances, and thus neither of them is a problem when the hindrances are absent.

    >Could you also confirm that in the last sutta cited in this essay, namely AN 10.61, the translation is "lack of ayoniso manasikara" and not "lack of yoniso manasikara"?

    Yes, a typo, it seems.

### Collection of Q/A type comments on the HH channel

I have greatly learned and cleared some of my misunderstandings from the comments section of HH videos especially when someone from HH replies to the comments. I thought it would be good to have a collection of all such Q/A kind of comments.

[Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P8pzs2XX4xBXdOJT5wtC0FkjLIxXUg5X/view) is an easy to read document for the same.

Hope this helps and please let me know if there are any issues with this or anything else.
Thank you.

Edit: [Doc link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dwd5ylXMQOXwJ_2aulgEd7O-tLQRKzZ_/view) that will get updated periodically

    This is quite useful, since those comments get buried up and forgotten. I'll show it to Ajahn Nyanamoli so perhaps he'll publish it too.

    Is it possible to compile the new comments from there onwards in intervals of time as well?

### Please me identify that state I keep going in.

Hi everyone,  
I have a question but some context first. I'm a tibetan translator, been meditating for 2 decade or so but mostly in the Theravadan traditions. I recently found Ajahn Nanamoli and Hillside Hermitage  and immediately tried to understand and implement his teachings.  
Since then, I've been trying to pay more heed to peripheral awareness and stay mindful in my daily life but something unusual is happening. Since a few days it seems I can trigger some kind of awareness watching state that I know nothing about. Basically, while I'm talking I'm able to observe myself talking, it feels that "I" is the one watching. What is strange is that when I speak I don't know who is speaking or how those words are coming out as I'm not in charge and I can't see myself thinking before words come out. What's weird is that this watcher that I feel is me is kinda empty because I don't choose/think the words coming out yet they come out. By the way, I'm a translator and I'm able to trigger this state while translating which normally requires a fairly high mental work. At times I'm also able to watch myself thinking. To trigger this state requires next to no effort, it's like switching a switch. It does not feel bad, it's just that this watching consciousness feels totally empty yet stuff/words are coming out of it ??  I wonder what is this ? I mean, should I try to cultivate that state.awareness or is it totally useless and should be discarded ? What is that state/ability ?  
Thanks to all and sorry for my poor attempt at describing it.

    This is the sort of thing one would tend to wrongly emphasize when there's still a remnant of a view that insight into the Dhamma is defined by some sort of "experience", or that it's an "altered mode of perception" that you just tap into, just without the aid of psychoactive drugs.

    If it were to be relevant to the path in any way, you would need to for instance see a crystal clear connection to the *inability* to act out of sensual desire (even if you wanted to) in the future as well, when you're not abiding in that state. This is what the  "states of awareness" the Buddha taught necessarily lead to (which is the sole reason he taught them), as opposed to just providing you with something that's more captivating than sense indulgence at the time. Besides, I'm sure tons of people achieve special states of awareness "empty of I", or so they think, during sexual intercourse and similar, proving that it's not even right mindfulness/samādhi/liberation which hinge fully on right intention and right effort.

    And if you were anywhere in the neighborhood of the right type of "states", or at least got a sense of how to direct the mind so as to develop them, you would also be equally clear about the sheer amount of work you've had to put in to dry your mind out from sensual desires and craving way beforehand, often involving quite a bit of internal turmoil in that *long* process, as opposed to them arising from some shift of attention that you suddenly discovered.

    You would be immensely closer to finding the way out of the sense of "I" by sincerely questioning why you regard this as special in the first place, because the "I" is where *background passion for, interest in, and enchantment with anything*, no matter how "spiritual", is. Understanding The Way out of any such passion whatsoever (which is essentially the Right View) is how the right type of "states",i.e. Right samādhi and Arahantship, eventually can be *developed* with total deliberation by means of that blueprint, instead of experienced by chance.

    >My question remain : while continuing to strive for right view and cultivating Sila with sense restraint, should I try to cultivate this way of being aware, this watching consciousness, and investigate more or should I just focus on sense restraint striving for understanding ?

    Well, even if, say, you put aside what I wrote above, there's still another reason why this wouldn't be something to cultivate. The phrases "I don't know who is speaking or where the words are coming from", are very likely revealing a subtle view that anattā is about "agecylessness", and that the lack of "I am" is about the actions somehow happening on their own or being disconnected from your point of view. This is a common misunderstanding of what anattā is, and the fact that you seem to regard this state as important points to that view being present to a degree.

    When you correctly "step back" from your experience to discern the unownable nature of your actions or similar, you know *exactly* "who" is talking, moving, etc. It's not that you "don't know" or it seems like it's "just happening". Anattā is about the fact that EVEN if you exert infinite amounts of control over anything and everything and manipulate your aggretates to a T, all that is  *still not yours* (which is why an Arahant still "controls" things externally). So, contrary to popular belief, in order to see anattā, you need to actually begin with accepting that *everything* you do is "yours". When you manage to abandon everything without forsaking that recognition, you are abandoning ownership on the right level, as opposed to denying the ownership through a preconceived idea of what the ending of kamma is.

    The right type of "stepping back" that even a puthujjana can do is something that would inevitably lead him to freedom from sensuality, and does not carry with it such coarse misconceptions of what not-self is—it's in agreement with mundane right view that "I am the owner of my actions" and so on, whereas "agencylessness" errs into the denial of self. That's why if a puthujjana develops the right type of "awareness" (which would lead them to samādhi like the Buddha's first teachers), they are *reinforcing* mundane right view and self-transparency, so if they were to hear the teaching on anattā, their minds would be swiftly liberated.

    >Also, for the last few months I've been trying to be as mindful as possible and I realise that I may have made a mistake when trying to keep track of peripheral  awareness and instead I think I was maybe in this state.

    So the peripheral awareness we teach would be about acknowledging that there is a sense of self and that *you* are doing everything without exception. It is also about putting everything in question and not taking for granted anything you experience, no matter how "right" it feels. Abandoning that "taking for granted" and "regarding as right" is much closer to overcoming the sense of self than a state that seems to be "empty of a doer".

    As a puthujjana, one would fail to recognize that there is a very real "I"  craving behind that whole "state", and would block one's own progress by thinking the sense of self has diminished to any degree.

    In short, it will only serve to foster wrong view.

    >maybe MN2 is relevant to the OP. "when he attends ayoniso the view 'I perceive not-self with self' arises in him as true and established" or maybe "Or else he is inwardly perplexed about the present thus: ‘Am I? Am I not? What am I? How am I? Where has this being come from? Where will it go?’" could be apt?

    The most important thing to note when it comes to this is the nature of a *view*. When MN 2 (and SN 22.1 has an equivalent variation that recurs often) says that "the view arises for him", people often misinterpret that as "he willingly takes up this  philosophical standpoint and openly proclaims it", and by extension believe themselves to not have any of these views despite being puthujjanas. But a view is much subtler than that, and a puthujjana *must* be having one of these despite all their conviction in the idea of anattā. Hence the Buddha does not give a third alternative somewhere in-between these views and the Right View, neither here nor anywhere else.

    A view is basically something that is "embedded" into your point __of view__, thus your "eyes" (including the mental "eye") carry the view no matter where they look (even if it's at the Dhamma and the Suttas that you understood intellectually). That's why "not holding to fixed views" is not a matter of choice. Not holding certain *opinions* is a matter of choice, but that's trivial, and the Buddha was pretty "opinionated" despite holding no views.

    This is why it's not about figuring out which one you're holding, and even if the Buddha himself told you, it wouldn't necessarily make a difference. If you "see" which one you have and are still a puthujjana, that's not it. And when you tell another, they will misunderstand and think they just have to change an *opinion*, or something on that deliberate level. So the Buddha is not telling one to "diagnose" which view is present. He's just saying, "there is self view; it will have to particularly manifest as one of these at any given time; this is the way out of it".

    >Its the kind of thing Ajahn is talking about when he brings up the wild animal tamer simile isn't it? a way of rephrasing what you are saying about how you (I/this intender of possible intentions/this king's cook) should taking up responsibility for what you are responsible for (this self im bound to/citta/wild animal)?

    Yes, you could say what you take responsibility for is your __feeding or starving__ the views of self, which will depend on your bodily and verbal actions, and  then your accurate understanding of what yoniso and ayoniso manasikāra are, as MN 2 says. For as long as the citta is not tamed through actual restraint and so on, self will be somewhere in the picture.

    And it's because views depend on the citta that you cannot take a neutral position outside of it and suddenly not have "I am" anymore, or even start grasping what not-self means until you tame it. If you forget that and start thinking you can temporarily have no sense of self as a puthujjana, it's not even that you will "start holding"—you will *proliferate* the already existing view of self, whichever form it takes.

### Sampajāno=Alert!!!

Sampajañña is big word in other tradition. whereas here  Satima is big word. and discussed in immense detail. However I could not find any video, where Sampajāno is discussed in detail.

is it that simple , Sampajāno =alert!!!!

HH usually  warn again  practice of observing,focusing, attending etc. but never mentioned that attending or observing is same as  sampajānakārī.   or  is there any value addition of being alert  on what you attend.

&#x200B;

Also when he says discern. does it mean anupassana?. like kayanupassana= discernment of kaya.

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/17ai3wn/sampajānoalert/k5h69xy/)** _2023-10-18 23:52:32:

    >Sampajañña is big word in other tradition. whereas here  Satima is big word. and discussed in immense detail. However I could not find any video, where Sampajāno is discussed in detail.

    Practically speaking, these are not two different things as overly methodical traditions/approaches might present them. Rather,  both sati and sampajaññā are necessarily present when one with Right View engages in Right Effort. So the aim must be to acquire that first, making sure not to think that one's current sati and sampajaññā are right even if it all makes sense in theory.

    >HH usually  warn again  practice of observing,focusing, attending etc. but never mentioned that attending or observing is same as  sampajānakārī.   or  is there any value addition of being alert  on what you attend.

    True, because "observing" is not sampajaññā.

    >“So too, bhikkhus, here some foolish, incompetent, unskilful bhikkhu dwells contemplating a body in the body (a feeling in feelings ... a phenomenon in phenomena) ardent, clearly comprehending, mindful, having removed covetousness and displeasure in regard to the world. While he dwells contemplating the body in the body (etc.) his mind does not become concentrated, his corruptions are not abandoned, he does not pick up that hint.

    >That foolish, incompetent, unskilful bhikkhu does not gain pleasant dwellings in this very life, nor does he gain  mindfulness and clear comprehension __(satisampajaññā)__ For what reason? __Because, bhikkhus, that foolish, incompetent, unskilful bhikkhu does not pick up the hint of his own mind."__
    —SN 47.8

    In other words, you can try to be as "alert" as you possibly can, registering every single tiny movement your body makes, not slipping for a second, and yet still there will be no sati or sampajaññā. That practice will actually be going in the opposite direction, because you can't be seeing the peripheral attitudes your mind exhibits *and* at the same time be intentionally focusing on particular objects that are way coarser.

    And note how this whole Sutta points out that the unskilled monk's practice is insufficient *simply* because he doesn't take the hint of his mind. It doesn't say that his effort in terms of the 4 satipaṭṭhānas is wrong, so he is already at least trying to reflect and look at the background of his situation instead of irrelevant details. So if one takes the effort to be about focusing and observing, one ends up even worse than that unskilled monk.

    
    >Also when he says discern. does it mean anupassana?. like kayanupassana= discernment of kaya.

    Not quite. Anupassana is more like "contemplation", which means it's not necessarily accurate (as will be the case before the Right View). "Discernment" (which you could even argue is equivalent to sampajaññā) is there only when the contemplation is right, i.e. when one takes the hint of the mind, as the Sutta says.

    And, just to emphasize, the cittanimitta and the Right View are intimately linked, so this Sutta also heftily reinforces the point that to do any mindfulness practice correctly, Right View must be present.

### How is the mind trainable when it is not in my control?

So Ajahn has been teaching about training the mind as the goal of the gradual training. But if really the mind is not in my control i.e. it is of the Mara's domain - is it really trainable? I mean it is but where am I wrong in this reasoning. Can't Mara keep my mind "wild" as in the simile of wild animals? Thanks.

(I am sorry if this seems a hypothetical question but just wanted to put it here. Let me know if this question is of the "unanswerable" or similar kind where the basis is wrong.)

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/17909gs/how_is_the_mind_trainable_when_it_is_not_in_my/k569pgr/)** _2023-10-16 21:39:03:

    >Can't Mara keep my mind "wild" as in the simile of wild animals? Thanks.

    No, that's actually the whole point we try to emphasize in various ways (with the whole "right endurance" especially).

    Māra has control of your *senses* (which includes the sixth, *mano*), but you and your past actions are solely responsible for your *citta*, and that's where Dukkha is rooted. That's why freedom from it is possible in the first place.

    >The eye is mine, ascetic, forms are mine, and the base where eye-pressure is cognized is mine.
    Where can you go, ascetic, to escape from me? The ear is mine, ascetic, sounds are mine … The nose is mine, ascetic, odours are mine … The tongue is mine, ascetic, tastes are mine … The body is mine, ascetic, tactile objects are mine … The mind (*mano*) is mine, ascetic, mental phenomena are mine, and the base where mental-pressure is cognized  is mine. Where can you go, ascetic, to escape from me?"
    —SN 4.9

    >Venerable sir, it is said, ‘Māra, Māra.’ In what way, venerable sir, might there be Māra or the description of Māra?”

    >“Where there is the eye, Samiddhi, where there are forms,  eye-consciousness, things to be cognized by eye-consciousness, there Māra exists or the description of Māra.

    >"Where there is the ear … the mind, where there are mental phenomena, mind-consciousness, things to be cognized by mind-consciousness, there Māra exists or the description of Māra.

    >“Where there is no eye, Samiddhi, no forms, no eye-consciousness, no things to be cognized by eye-consciousness, there Māra does not exist nor any description of Māra.

    >"Where there is no ear … no mind, no mental phenomena, no mind-consciousness, no things to be cognized by mind-consciousness, there Māra does not exist nor any description of Māra.”
    —SN 35.65

    And, to put it concisely "the place where Māra does not exist" is not a mystical realm that results from a meditation experience; it's the complete dispassion that results from understanding the nature of the six senses, recognizing that even the pressure they exert is not in one's control, but one's craving in regard to it can be *indirectly* abandoned (i.e. "tamed").

    The issue is of course that the whole reason why a person remains without the Right View is that they don't see that which must be "tamed", since they're used to recognizing only the things they can *look at*, which is necessarily going to be within Māra's domain, not the attitude in regard to it which is the *citta*. Even when they try to practice dispassion, this is what happens:

    >“Herein, what are the six kinds of equanimity based on the household life? On seeing a form with the eye ... on cognizing phenomenon with the mind (mano) equanimity arises in a foolish infatuated ordinary person, in an untaught ordinary person who has not conquered the boundary __[of the six senses]__ or conquered the results of actions and who is blind to danger. Such equanimity as this does not transcend the form ... mental phenomenon; that is why it is called equanimity based on the household life.
    —MN 137

    In other words, they can only make their *6 senses that belong to Māra* equanimous, but the *citta* remains on a subtler level untamed and liable to do whatever "it" wants (i.e. peripherally harbor greed, aversion and delusion) once they stop suppressing the sense domain, which is why the equanimity is fleeting and not fundamental. This is what pretty much any meditation technique or focusing practice gives you.

    Instead, by unwaveringly committing to virtue, sense restraint and watchfulness of intentions behind everything including your restraint—there is no way to just "figure out" the citta correctly by reflecting on it—it becomes clear that despite your 6 senses having their own tendencies to "pull" towards pleasure and away from pain, your *citta* does not need to be partaking in that (and you begin that "disconnect" in it's most basic form by none other than not acting out of desires).

    Once the *citta* is completely dispassionate towards the six senses as a result of the Gradual Training, you can't say that they are "pulling" anything anymore, no matter what Māra does with them. They can pull and cause dukkha only when there is a suitable basis of resistance to pressure in the *citta*.

    >“Bhikkhus, the uninstructed worldling speaks of ‘the ocean, the ocean.’ But that is not the ocean in the Noble One’s Discipline; that is only a great mass of water, a great expanse of water.

    >“The eye (ear... nose... tongue... body... mind), bhikkhus, is the ocean for a person; its current consists of forms (sounds... smells... tastes... touches... mental phenomena).One who __withstands__ that current consisting of forms (...etc.) is said to have crossed the ocean of the eye (...etc.) with its waves, whirlpools, sharks, and demons. Crossed over, gone beyond, the brahmin stands on high ground.

    > I thought the citta referred to the mind.

    Well, yes, the issue is there's no good term as far as I've found to distinguish citta from mano in English. "Heart" has unhelpful connotations.

    >I just looked into Nanavira's Note on Citta and I wasn't able to understand anything there right now

    Yes, I think he doesn't talk about citta in this acute sense anywhere in the Notes, although it's certainly implied. That's one of the reasons why, if one misunderstands him, which is not unlikely, one can end up thinking that seeing the Dhamma is *only* about grasping an idea with mano (which ignorance already implicitly believes). One would miss arguably the most important half of the equation, which a very explicit emphasis on restraint and Gradual Training makes harder to overlook.

    
    >It seems mano is a sense in the same way as the eye, but the citta is not?

    That's right. The citta and its affairs are not perceivable as objects of your senses. But it can't be emphasized enough that this doesn't mean it's "hidden" or that you need to wait for it to suddenly reveal itself. It's no more "hidden" than suffering, craving and defilements are, because the citta is what those things find footing in. 

    To have any chance of discerming the citta, one needs to first at least intellectually acknowledge that it will not be found where object are. Even if it's the "right" objects such as the accurate reflections that the Suttas talk about (which pertain to mano), that's still does not mean seeing the citta, and thus those reflections won't necessarily "land" where they have to (see SN 47.8, simile of the cook).

    In the case of a puthujjana, for as long as they are suffering or even *could* be suffering, they can know beyond doubt that the citta must be there: which means, it's always there.

    So if it sounds inconceivable that there can be something in your experience which is not on the same level as all other objects, reflect on the nature of suffering itself (of the existential kind). It's clearly not an "object" in the way one is used to, because if it were, you could simply stop perceiving it just like when you shut your eyes or cover your ears. You would at least be able to "stop thinking it" with mano. But you can't do any of that, and nevertheless it's there, manifest.

    __A reflection that points in the direction of distinguishing citta from mano:__

    Imagine a disagreeable experience. Now, that disagreeability itself is not the citta yet. No matter how sharp or personal it feels, that's still an affair of the senses ("the first arrow"), coming from mano in this case, and all this is "Māra's bait".

    Transparently asking yourself to what extent there is a seeming *need* to respond to that disagreeability and act out of it points in the direction of the citta. And, again, you wouldn't possibly be able to pin that "need" down into an object, in which case abandoning aversion would be as easy as stopping the sense object or arisen thought (and it's not rare to believe that's how it is, thus assuming the first and second arrows to be identical, and meditation to be about hiding away from any and all arrows).

    Hence, when there is none of that "need", which is the end result of the Gradual Training, then there is no suffering, despite Māra continuing to do with the five senses and mano, and their corresponding feelings, whatever he wants. When the Suttas say Māra was "tempting the Buddha for seven years", that's not *just* by coming to him face to face and engaging in poetry duels as it may superficially seem throughout the Mārasaṁyutta.

    The temptation comes from the fact that even he had no ultimate control over the feelings/pressure of his six sense base. Māra was just verbally reminding him of that on top of laying out the bait. So all the Buddha did is tame his citta to the ultimate degree so that it stopped wanting to *take* the bait, and that's all that's needed.

    Yes, and also there are many "layers" to that "getting absorbed", and thus also an increase in being able to allow particulars to endure without going with the grain of them (which is the whole point—to eventually not have to be actively holding back one's mind in any way in order for it to be free). 

    So it's about containing the assumption and then keeping it so until becoming absorbed is impossible even if you want to, not until a perfect way of relating to particulars is figured out, which is still "management".

    
    >a *driving need* to do something about *this*. 

    And even this is not necessarily an issue if there is no driving need to do something about "the driving need to do something about this" (hence there's no such thing as "subconscious urges", or valid excuses for not being restrained.) The developed mind is always effortlessly "one step ahead" whether you tell it to or not, and doesn't need to get rid or suppress anything.

    So the practice is to be trying to be a step ahead and restrain any unwholesome need *without* craving to get rid of it, no matter how subtle or peripheral it gets.

Is following HH on telegram needed for serious followers of the Venerable I noticed a couple of interesting articles on there but besides that I’d rather not need another app to deal with. But don’t want to miss out on any good teaching?

    >You don't *need* more content; in fact, if you stopped consuming any new content from HH, and simply engaged deeply with what is currently out, that would be enough.

    That is true in a general sense. But practically speaking, when there is the opportunity to do so, it's useful to hear the same thing put in a slightly different way a million as opposed to a thousand times if possible (*with an authentic attitude of trying to sift out misunderstandings*), since it reduces one's chance of thinking one understood it when one didn't to the maximum degree.

    The key is mainly to not start just collecting information and building an intellectual system for the sake of satisfaction, which will entail premature complacency, because then you'll  be inadvertently more preoccupied with fitting the new things you hear into your understanding, rather than the other way around. One can also be seeking more content due to pure, irrational craving against the pain of doubt, which is futile.

    Hence, again, the "authentic attitude of trying to sift out misunderstandings".

### What is the best way for me to familiarize myself with the Nikayas?

I had asked Ven. Anigha this question in one of the threads, but it was far too deep in the thread and so I've created another thread for this question upon Bhante's request. I'd appreciate anyone's advice.

I've only read MN "properly", and I barely remember the content from the MN because there are so many suttas and they're so long. I usually just research suttas based on a topic that I'm currently contemplating and MN and SN are usually more than enough for that. I've never tried to do any systematic reading of SN because there are just so many suttas to read from I don't know where to start and the same with AN. For DN, this is probably the one Nikaya that I've neglected the most because I the others were more than enough.

Even when I pick a topic I want to research, it's so hard to find the relevant suttas for those topics. Any strategy for familiarizing myself with them would be appreciated.

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/177tg1p/what_is_the_best_way_for_me_to_familiarize_myself/k4ww3ks/)** _2023-10-15 00:08:43:

    On the one hand, one should remember that ultimately one lacks the Right View not because one hasn't read enough Suttas and/or lacks the correct interpretation of "SN 95.30", but because one's mind has not been sufficiently cleared from obstructions (acting out by word, deed and thought; lack of sense restraint).

    Having said that, more familiarity with the early texts is never a bad thing *if one doesn't forget what the goal is* and instead begins to simply collect information to fit into a neat Dhamma "system". 

    The problem with trying to get too systematic about reading them is that, ultimately, what helps one recall Suttas easily *in the way that matters* is to actually understand them, and to see what they're talking about in one's own experience. 

    The results of a systematic study that isn't paired with that understanding will not only be inadequate in the ultimate sense, but even in the mundane, sheer intellectual familiarity sense.

    Because let's say you go through the Suttas by topic: that list of topics will likely have been arranged by someone who doesn't truly understand the *meaning* of the Suttas, and would not realize that some of them are actually very poignantly yet quietly describing, say, paṭiccasamuppāda. So you won't have truly learned the Suttas by topic except superficially.

    Nevertheless, one has to start somewhere, and pretty much any study you can put in, as long as, again, it's done for the sake of furthering clarity of discernment and not intellectual satisfaction, will be better than nothing. And as understanding increases from actual practice, you will see in hindsight that those Suttas actually meant more than you could even fathom at the time, and that is then building a "mental database" of the truly useful kind.

    
    Finally, learning Pāli for those who have the time to spare is highly beneficial, because that allows one to search for Suttas by their contents. Since they tend to use specific phrases again and again, once you know how a passage about say, sense restraint, is like in Pāli, you'll be able to find *all* Suttas on sense restraint. And if you're *reading* them in Pāli to boot, you're actually remembering all those phrases as you go on, so that will allow you to look them up in the future.

    
    Personally, I have never done "systematic study". Knowing Pāli and reading everything in it, coupled with a good memory which is a useful bonus, unlocks a different level of familiarity than reading translations ever could, not to mention the inability to be silently fed someone else's views as the Buddha's words. The problem is most people can't resist the temptation to become mere Dhamma scholars on account of this.

    That would depend on each individual, and fundamentally it's only right to say that they become particularly inspiring when one starts to understand them and *sees* the freedom from suffering being pointed at by those descriptions. That counts as "true inspiration" because a noble disciple's partially liberated mind can become fully liberated simply on account of it, whereas for a puthujjana, getting *too* inspired could mean they're overestimating their understanding—there should always a degree of doubt and confusion if they're being self-transparent.

    Besides that, I would probably just advise to read the entire Saṁyutta and Aṅguttara Nikāyas if possible, but not in a rush or as a scholarly endeavor (and there's tons of repetition so it's not as much as it seems.) The reason for that is that there's a lot of widely unknown material in there that's not only valuable in itself, but demolishes many  wrong views generally endorsed today.

    To give examples: SN 46.30 proves that the seven enlightenment factors are *acquired* by the stream enterer, whereas people like to believe they're already developing them before that point. Same with the five faculties: SN 48.18 shows that they are only present in at least the sotāpatti-magga (who is already a noble one, as the prior Sutta makes clear). All this squarely supports the point we so often repeat that there is no right practice, not even the basic faculty of mindfulness, present before sotāpatti.

    AN 10.61 shows that it's ceasing to act out by body, speech and mind that starves the five hindrances, not a focusing practice to stop thinking. There's also a myriad of Suttas disproving the common perceptions of what the jhānas and meditation are.

    So there's no particular selection; these gems are scattered all around, and they should provide enough "inspiration" to do away with all the mainstream approaches.

    >Reminds me of the preface of Clearing the Path:  

    Indeed, and there's another equally important quote of his

    >"...the Notes attempt to provide an intellectual basis for the understanding of the Suttas, without abandoning saddhā. It was, and is, my attitude towards the Suttas that, if I find anything in them that is against my own view, they are right, and I am wrong. I have no reason to regret having adopted this attitude."

    Often one will not realize/admit that one's judgement of "what resonates" or not is not accurate, and thus even allow oneself room to, if not reject specific Suttas, then at least shuffle over them inadvertently when they contradict one's view, especially when they threaten to demolish one's little "system".

    So it's just as important to deliberately use the Suttas *for the explicit purpose* of finding those discrepancies and correcting them, which is more unpleasant because it requires you to be fully authentic *the whole time* about your ignorance and the fact that you are seeking external help. 

    Just like a terminal patient who is intelligent enough to put away his pride and admit that he can't put his own inkling of what's helpful over whatever the head surgeon says. With the texts it has to be like this, especially the 4 Nikāyas. With modern teachers there's a lot of incompetent, even if well-meaning, "nurses" that pretend to understand the procedure the doctor has in mind, but will absolutely botch the *entire* thing up and have the patient die even sooner. So more circumspection is needed in that regard.

    >I tend to rely on my memory a lot - I remember what passages say, but I haven't made an effort to save references for others. Maybe I could try to do this more in the future - but I don't want to fall into a mode of collecting and organizing references.

    Yes, it's kind of not even "organizable" in a way unless it remains comparatively superficial. It will always be incomplete in a two-dimensional medium, though creating a reference "outside" can still be beneficial initially (especially for those Suttas that "don't resonate" which should be given the highest priority) if it's not made into scholarly data collection.

    Going through and being confident with A.K. Warder's book (there might be some lessons on YouTube) is already more than enough, and greater mastery than that might mean getting into scholarship for its own sake. There's also "A New Course in Reading Pāli" and perhaps others as well. 

    It's not necessary to know everything perfectly to start reading Suttas in Pāli. If one gets to the point where one can read them, generally understand the formation of words and needs a dictionary only for rarer terms, one might even put aside the books and just stick to the Suttas, and learn more technicalities later on if it seems necessary.

    If one can read Pāli like one reads English, that ought to be enough, and one will know when there's a need to analyze specific expressions more closely.

    Tool like digitalpalireader and Tipiṭaka Pali Reader (app) are extremely helpful. SuttaCentral can show Pali and English side-by-side (though the English is sometimes misleading when it comes to the profound stuff).

    I usually quote from Bhikkhu Bodhi's translations. They tend to have less deviant renderings at least compared to the others I've found, but even then, when I quote here I modify the terms that have been interpreted instead of translated, e.g. in the recent thread asking for two Sutta references it was "really knows" instead of "knowingly knows".

    His translations also tend to make use of Commentarial interpretations, such as that paticcasamuppada is a 3-life explanatory model, leading him to translate the literal "with this, this is" of the Pali to something like "when this exists, this *comes to be*" implying a temporal succession.

### Disambiguating the ambiguous notion of "contemplation" in the context of practice

In one of the comments in this subreddit a few weeks ago, I believe I stated that not *all* kinds of ambiguously-defined and ambiguously-directed contemplations are beneficial. But then I asked myself: well what kind of contemplation *is* beneficial? And I've been returning back to this question on and off for the past few days but haven't been able to make any progress.

When I refer to contemplation being "ambiguously-directed" I refer to the fact that it can be directed at any topics: politics, latest fashion trends, sensuality, non-sensuality, etc. There's an infinite quantity of subjects that can be contemplated, and certainly not all are considered good in the Dhamma. It's like having a bow and arrow: aiming the arrow everywhere is NOT good; if I end up aiming it at a person I will end up in a jail. So how to *decide* where to "direct" the arrow? Suppose I say I want to aim it at topics relating to the Dhamma:

* What does it mean to be "owners of your actions", and how do we ensure that we don't hide from that ownership?
* What is meant by *vinnana*? What is its nature? How does seeing its nature result in liberation?
* ...

I still do not know whether doing so is good or bad because that is determined through my current framework of good and bad which is rooted in wrong view according to the suttas. There have been many talks by HH about abstract vs practical Dhamma/contemplation/understanding, so it seems the "abstractness" is another factor used to determine whether a subject is useful or not. But abstractness isn't necessarily bad is it? It seems to be bad only if it's abstract for the sake of abstraction and has no practical roots. Practicality is good because I want to see whether that abstraction I've determined applies meaningfully to result in "*qualities that lead to dispassion, to being unfettered, to shedding, to modesty, to contentment, to seclusion, to aroused persistence, to being unburdensome*" as the suttas say. I can for instance abstractly contemplate the nature of vinnana as being liable to change, but it doesn't result in any particular orientation in experience itself that may contribute to "dispassion" of any kind. On the other hand, there are times where I've been thoroughly restrained and secluded and I can contemplate "all that is in front of me (the six senses) is dependent upon the body: is it possible for this 'all' to change? does its change have anything to do with my wish?" and immediately the "orientation" of the experience gets disturbed as its autonomous and independent nature is *revealed* and no longer points to 'me' as that too is equally liable to change; for a few minutes any pressure of whatever kind, physical or mental, ceases in its appearance.

There's quite clearly a distinction in *how* the contemplation takes place here: the first one was theoretical in the same way math would be, the second one was phenomenological (???). And this ambiguous difference in the *manner* of contemplation is what I refer to as "ambiguously-defined" contemplation; perhaps it should be "ambiguously-done" contemplation, but either way it refers to the *technique*. To apply this to the bow and arrow simile, the technique of holding the bow and arrow determines significantly where the arrow goes: holding it wrongly can end up hurting me myself since the string can hit me, or holding it wrongly can make the arrow go where I did not want it to be directed.

I've just *defined* the problem right now: that it is ambiguous to me from every perspective I can imagine. I have not even an ounce of clarity on this. I want to disambiguate this and have a precise notion of contemplation, is this possible? Or is this a wrong "direction" of the contemplation? Why is it wrong?

I would appreciate any insight on this problem.

    >I want to disambiguate this and have a precise notion of contemplation, is this possible?

    Practically speaking, the attempt to "disambiguate" it too much will result in it becoming theoretical, *even* if it makes perfect sense and is guided by phenomenology and the Suttas. However, this is not at all to say the right practice is somehow "indescribable and beyond words words", which is mysticism.

    "Theoretical" simply means that it's leaving the sense of self out of the picture, and this can happen no matter what you contemplate. Otherwise, somebody *telling you* the exact theme to contemplate would result in enlightenment automatically (which the extreme of rationalism as opposed to the mysticism of an esoteric  meditation experience). What gives rise to wisdom is not the subject of the contemplation itself, but rather being able to see the "level" where contemplation applies. Without seeing that level, the sense of self remains unpervaded by the contemplation, which means no true dispassion, even if you contemplate death itself and the utter destruction of everything that's dear to you with the utmost urgency.

    On the other hand, you may have not read a single word from the Suttas or even heard the word mind or consciousness, but if you see that what makes up your body is fundamentally not different from stones, leaves, and branches, and you are, first and foremost, discerning the body as a general phenomenon and not an object of perception, *and*, furthermore, also seeing that the things you hold dearly depend upon it, including your sense of self, then that "basic" contemplation will give rise to total dispassion.

    So it's about learning how to "trap" your sense of self into whatever you're contemplating. If you fail to do so, then, whether you recognize it or not and regardless of your views, the sense of self is the one contemplating at that moment, and thus craving is at work.

    You won't be able to get this perfectly right in the beginning, but this is exactly where virtue and restraint comes in. When your mind is throwing a tantrum on account of not giving it the things it wants, that's the perfect opportunity to start "trapping it" within your contemplation, because it's "movements" get highlighted. People often think restraint is for the sake of suppressing those movements and reaching the peace of an "empty mind", but that's not the case. It's to *reveal* the movements even more.

    Moreover, when you've been acting out of things, engaging with needless company, distractions, etc., your discernment and skill in contemplation will need to be manifold times sharper to be able to re-establish an accurate picture, and all your attempts will likely be theoretical even if you bring back all your past insights.

    And this is why an ordinary person needs to be manifold times more unforgiving with their restraint, while the one with the Right View and beyond can afford to drop the practice and *seemingly* get careless (as that layman Sarakāni who was drinking alcohol in the Suttas), but would be able to pick the right level of contemplation back up in a fingersnap as if nothing happened.

    That ability is also what makes the grasping at virtue and practices completely redundant, because one realizes that sitting cross legged 2 hours a day or any routine actions whatsoever one might assume are indispensable, do not magically contribute to having the right level to contemplate upon. Sure, certain habits of *abstinence* need to be in place well beforehand, but that in itself does not guarantee seeing the right level of contemplation.

    Rather, seeing the right level to contemplate on guarantees seeing the right level to contemplate on.

    >Thank you for the reply Bhante. So practical contemplations are those that involve trapping the sense of self, or seeing the redundancy of its mastery?

    >I wonder, does this apply to all contemplations or is this only for the satipatthanas? For example, we're told to contemplate that we're owner of our actions as part of daily contemplations, how would we do this in a manner that traps the sense of self?

    The point I was making is that no contemplation, no matter how accurate, traps the sense of self in itself, in which case enlightenment would be easy, and the utterance of another explaining such a contemplation would do 99% of the work for you.

    Instead, you learning how to trap the sense of self traps the sense of self. If you do so (which entails grasping the sign of the mind and getting the Right View), *anything* you reflect on will work and thus further develop the mind.

    Then, even something like this would "trap" lust, and thus the sense of self by extension:

    >"Come, bhikkhus, towards women old enough to be your mother set up the idea that they are your mother; towards those of an age to be your sisters set up the idea that they are your sisters; towards those young enough to be your daughters set up the idea that they are your daughters.’ This is a cause and reason, great king, why these young bhikkhus … lead the complete and pure holy life all their lives and maintain it continuously.” —SN 35.127

    
    >Also, we're told to contemplate so many different things in the suttas, the breath, body, feelings, mind, sickness, old age, death, etc. And it's difficult to figure out which contemplations apply to me and which don't, or at least which ones I should do. How should I go about figuring this out? I've just stuck with contemplation of the body for now

    You can take your pick from the Suttas. It doesn't really matter as long as you never forget that it's still not applying to the right level, and keep countinuously making effort to discern what that "level" is. 

    If today you contemplate the body and tomorrow your actions, the only relevant part that could contribute to the Right View is how with either of them you will be making the effort to uncover the signs of the mind. Intellectual insights about what the body/mind are and so on can be had by an intelligent puthujjana, and thus are not ultimately what liberates the mind (you would lose those when you die or get Alzheimer's, or when you're simply busy ATM). What liberates is the ability to know peripherally/implicitly the nature phenomena in their very arising, without you actively doing anything.

    Which is why, hypothetically, some Arahants could give much less technical descriptions of such things and be no less free from suffering. The point is that there is no longer ignorance, not that there is some *specific* knowledge that you could just directly hand over to someone else and "transfer" the Dhamma to them. Or rather, that's only half the picture.

    Hence, "to be seen by the wise for themselves", as the Suttas say.

    Edit: re "insights you would forget when you die": People who think special meditation experiences, visions, ideas and "eureka moments" constitute actual insight don't realize that all that will disappear if they just died or got Alzheimer's. Yet, this it not to say that insight is "beyond words" in some mystical sense.

### body within body !!!

I asked youtube but did not get answer.. Lets see  if someone here can help me.(I am sorry for very basic question..)

when you say body within body.. what is container body? and what body it contains? 

do you mean the contained body is the separate self or ego/panca-upadan-khanda. in other word see the self is contained by this physicial body.?

In other words the nama-kaya( mind) is contained in rupa-kaya( physical body)?

\-----

I asked this question 2 month back on  old video titled " Four Foundations of Mindfulness to Enter Jhana ".  which was based on MN125.Today I was again going thr latest video " The Mind Whisperer" also based on MN 125.

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/176rj53/body_within_body/k4pna59/)** _2023-10-13 14:42:11:

    "Body[1] within body[2]" means that you learn to see your entire experience,  the six senses and their objects, as a body[2] that is secondary, less relevant, on the "surface" of body[1]. "Within" means just that: body[1] sits at the "center" of body[2], and thus is more fundamental.

    Body[1] can be anything that is a simultaneous foundation for the body that you see, use, and are attached to. It's the material things that your body[2] relies on to exist, such as your organs, the 4 elements, your breathing, and mere material form that is no more special than that of a corpse.

    By repeatedly seeing that simultaneous *relationship* correctly— not by focusing on one thing alone, which would only sustain the sense of __me__ being at the core of the experience and looking at it—you eventually become unable to exercise any passion and ownership over *both* body[1] and body[2], which together constitute your entire life. You now see that you cannot possibly be that center even if you want to, and body[1], which is clearly impermanent, becomes the center instead. Same principle applies to the other satipaṭṭhānas.

    The well-known "in the seen just the seen" utilizes the same imagery of something being "inside". One learns to see that that "center", where the notion of self gets established, is nothing more than subtler phenomena that pertain to and thus depend on what is seen, namely less palpable thoughts, intentions, feelings, notions,  memories, etc. If you actually discern that that "center" is a *thing*, just much subtler than the sights are, you can no longer take it as your self. "In the seen just the seen" has nothing to do with the fallacious idea of "bare perceptions".

    But the caveat to all this is that, unless a person has the Right View, they cannot actually see this principle on the right level (because if they did, the view of self wouldn't be there still—it can't survive when those two things are seen simultaneously). So one must remember that whatever one is contemplating is still on the level of theory until that point, and not think that one already understood right mindfulness.

    Lastly, what allows one to get the Right View and see those two levels is seeing the "hint" of the mind (cittanimitta we often talk about), and for that hint to be grasped, one needs to have been living restrained from sensuality and not delighting in the company of others for a long time. Unrestrained actions ("me here" seeking the pleasant objects "out there") and company ("me here" and other people "out there") automatically abolish perspective and thus reinforce that wrong "center".

    >Bhikkhus, (1) it is impossible that a bhikkhu who delights in company, who is delighted with company, who is devoted to delight in company; who delights in a group, who is delighted with a group, who is devoted to delight in a group, will find delight in solitude when he is alone. (2) It is impossible that one who does not find delight in solitude when he is alone will acquire the hint of the mind. (3) It is impossible that one who does not acquire the hint of the mind will fulfill the Right View. (4) It is impossible that one who does not fulfill the Right View will fulfill Right Composure. (5) It is impossible that one who does not fulfill Right Composure will abandon the fetters. (6) Without having abandoned the fetters, it is impossible that one will realize Nibbāna.

    It's impossible to determine in advance how long it will take. (See SN 22.101 & AN 3.92).

    Practically, one should be thinking in terms of years and not months or weeks. Obviously, the quality of one's effort and the views that one carries are influential factors, because one can live two times more isolated than most enlightened monks did in the past, never see anyone, and eat once a month, but because of one views (e.g., that meditation is about focusing and Nibbāna is a special experience or vision that just "occurs"), one wouldn't see the signs of the mind any better no matter how long one's been locked up in a cave.

    Also, the learning to recognize those signs is not like gaining proficiency in some contemporary meditation technique. It's something that you cannot even imagine until you already achieved it, because your very imagination is fully immersed in the ignorance of those signs, regardless of how much the Dhamma "makes sense". On the other hand, you can certainly imagine how it'd be like to master a focusing practice, which means it's not in any way a profound development of the mind resulting from abandoning ignorance.

    Lastly, the Sutta speaks of *delighting* in company, not in company per se. So what one needs to do is strive for immaculate and relentless self-transparency in regard to every minute one spends in the presence of other people, and avoid it if no justifiable reason for it is apparent. Noticing when the mind is clearly just craving for its frequent dose of distraction and entertainment: one needs to start *taking the hints* of how "I have to talk to this person for X practical reason" turns into "let's have a fun chat".

    That's how one stops delighting in company and will automatically start reducing it to the lowest possible minimum.

    >Can you also throw some light on what is internal and external, in context of "Body\[1\] within body\[2\]"

    That's a more advanced topic and it's not even essential to know about it. 

    I will mention though that it's not, as generally interpreted, about contemplating external things like people as opposed to internal ones, which I've seen leads some to think that reflecting on worldly phenomena contributes to enlightenment. 

    Rather, when the person with Right View practices satipaṭṭhāna, they will be doing so automatically in *any* one of these 3 ways at any given time, and they will be abandoning covetousness and grief towards the world. And that's what matters.

    So the effort is in truly trying to *discern*—not just "figuring out" through reasoning—what "body in the body" even means. Once one learns to discern it, one will have the Right View.

    >Moreover , when You say 'Same principle applies to the other satipaṭṭhānas.'.that is tough to grasp, as all bhikhus leaves that on us to contemplate,. so I humbly request to repeat it for other satipattha. 

    >At list Vedan\[1\] within Vedana\[2\].does that means two vedana symulteniously exist? same is to Dhamma\[1\]->dhamma\[2\], citta\[1\]->citta\[2\].

    Yes, liberation is possible in the first place because there *are* always two things simultaneously present—one less "far away", the other more "far away"—in one's experience (thus the fallacy in "non-duality"), so one can never be a true master of it. The two things mutually determine each other at the same time (this is paṭiccasamuppāda) and there's no room for a master in that, despite the fact that the same feelings and significances continue to manifest.

    In the case of feeling, there's always a feeling in your experience that's more "central" than all the others, which are comparatively fleeting. An example of this is when you've having a good day, and all the particular things you encounter, some of which may be quite unpleasant, don't disturb you as much.

    So you see that at the core of those other feelings, determining them, lies that more primary feeling. When this is seen, you don't then need to go and remove the sense of ownership and tell yourself that feeling is not yours. It won't be yours because you're no longer the center whether you like it or not, but rather that "core" feeling is (and always was).

    With the mind it's the same. A more primary state of mind always underlies all the more particular moods that may arise. So you discern that as the center. This is how you would begin to see what actually determines an action as unwholesome. It's whether that "core" has greed, aversion and delusion in it and you're acting out of it, not whether externally you move like this or talk like that.

    
    With dhammas it's more varied, but to give an example, you would see the sense bases as the "center" and everything else as surrounding that. Only by not seeing that that's the actual center and thus automatically *being* the center oneself, can there be lust or aversion towards sense experiences. And that's also how the hindrances work: they hinder you because their center  is "inside you" and you don't know how to see it so as to "vomit it out", thus everything you do is acting out of those hindrances, even the Dhamma practice initially. It's not because of what comes *to* that center, which is why it's futile to try to stop one's thinking, concentrate, etc.

    But it doesn't hurt to repeat that one is *trying* to discern all this. It's catastrophic to fall into the view that one is already doing it correctly and is somehow not a sotāpanna yet, or worse, that one is when one is not.

    >It's just that "center" for me has connotations of "me" surrounding the body(1) which is at center,  instead of "me" being enclosed by body(1). 

    Yes, that's pretty much the point. It's not about denying that experience has a center, because it does even for an Arahant, otherwise there would be no differences in traits between two Arahants.

    Correctly aeeing that the "gravitational center" of experience is a *phenomenon* (say, your actual heart), and that everything else is "orbiting around it", automatically prevents the assumption of self from taking place (thus it gives rise to the Right View automatically). One doesn't need to go and "stop the self", which only results in still maintaining that same self.

    
    >How can we understand body(1) when all our experiences are from the perspective of body(2)? 

    >We can be peripherally aware that body(1) exists beneath body(2) by recognizing that our perceptions are only possible due to our senses, which cannot be directly perceived outside of our sensory experiences. In essence, we can't directly grasp "body(1)" but can only "experience bodily perceptions (body(2))."

    Exactly; that's the difficulty. If you just try to *look at* body(1) (even with your direct thoughts), it will for that very reason be within body(2), and thus *you* as the center/master will be implicitly existing behind that "looking", even if you whole-heartedly believe that "there is no self" and "it's just a body".

    It's about learning to "take the hint of" how body(1) is *implied* in body(2), without making it into a new thing. As I mentioned in the other post above, sense restraint is the primary aid to that. When your experience is "swirling" because of a desire that you're not satisfying or an unpleasant thing you're not getting rid of, it becomes much easier to see what that "swirling" is happening around. This would over time reveal what the sense bases actually are, i.e. the *actual* center that you have no say in.

    So if body(1) is not clear, or if it feels like you already see it and are somehow still not a sotāpanna, then improving your sense restraint is the way to break the plateau and uncover the work that is left. 

    The extent to which you suffer when you increase sense restraint is the extent to which you still don't actually see body(1).

    The "swirling" (agitation on account of not giving in to desires) is a symptom of the illness, which is the lust in the citta. One needs to allow the the "swirling" to endure so as to be able to discern its actual root eventually, and not try to get rid of the symptoms by attending to bodily sensations and similar instead. That would make one even more ignorant of the simultaneous cause of those symptoms.

    Any of these different ways of looking at experience works, and the point is not to try to draw parallels between them, which most Arahants in the past surely wouldn't have been able to do because they didn't have access to every single Sutta like us today.

    When you learn to see your experience as a whole properly (sign of the mind), you don't need to label it as 5 aggregates, namarūpa and whatnot. You simply see that the whole thing that you can control is there enduring, standing upon something else that you have no control over. 
    Sakkāya will be there for as long as that is not seen correctly through any of these frameworks that the Buddha formulated.

### How Gradual Traning, Not Focusing, Leads to A Calm Mind



- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1758cvj/how_gradual_traning_not_focusing_leads_to_a_calm/k51ufsr/)** _2023-10-16 00:19:41 *(in reply to a comment not included)*:

    >There seems to be clear distinction between me and my mind - there is me training my mind, me taming my mind, me suffering on account of minds actions, me communicating with mind.

    >What is this "me" and what is that mind?

    >"Me" is rational part of mind and "mind" is more primitive, hidden under surface part of mind or something different altogether?

    It won't quite be possible to figure it out through reasoning alone,  because that will be "you" theorizing, even if it's perfectly accurate (though it often isn't), with the mind invisible "behind you". 

    A crucial view not to fall into is that it's "hidden" or "subconscious" by any means, which leads people to believe in "subconscious urges". The mind right "there" from the day you were born, just "closer" than the actions, thoughts and ideas that you would call "me" or "mine". And it's certainly not "in your head/brain", because that's the *result* of the mind being there and enduring.

    Practically, the best way to *discern* this distinction as it really is is sense restraint. The longer you spend not going towards pleasure and avoid pain impulsively, the clearer it will become, in the way that matters, that there is "something" there that does not obey your will and actions ("you") directly and has its own agenda. That's the only way to discern it for what it is and not just theoretically.

    Also, some people seem to think speaking in terms of a "me" is  contradictory to the Dhamma, but that's disproven by the Suttas.

    >"Bhikkhus, I will teach you the burden, the carrier of the burden,  the taking up of the burden, and the laying down of the burden. Listen to that….

    >“And what, bhikkhus, is the burden? It should be said: the five aggregates subject to clinging. What five? The form aggregate subject to clinging, the feeling aggregate subject to clinging, the perception aggregate subject to clinging, the volitional formations aggregate subject to clinging, the consciousness aggregate subject to clinging. This is called the burden.

    >“And what, bhikkhus, is the carrier of the burden? It should be said: the person, this venerable one of such a name and clan. This is called the carrier of the burden.

    “And what, bhikkhus, is the taking up of the burden? It is this craving that leads to renewed existence, accompanied by delight and lust, seeking delight here and there; that is, craving for sensual pleasures, craving for existence, craving for extermination. This is called the taking up of the burden.

    “And what, bhikkhus, is the laying down of the burden? It is the remainderless fading away and cessation of that same craving, the giving up and relinquishing of it, freedom from it, non-reliance on it. This is called the laying down of the burden.”
    —[SN 22.22](https://suttacentral.net/sn22.22/en/bodhi)

    And innumerable others where the Buddha says, "the monk directs *his* mind like this and like that".

    [Theragātha 19.1](https://suttacentral.net/thag19.1/en/sujato) is about a monk "talking to his mind".

    It's also good to note that it's "citta" being discussed here. *mano*/the realm of thinking is not that which is liberated, and is part of what the Buddha called "the All", i.e. where dispassion must be developed (which is not *at all* to say "stop thinking").

    [This](https://youtu.be/eYuaf0iW8wc?si=fCkVz5Rw9nb2hpj) goes into the difference between the two.

    
    Lastly, contrary to this mind being taken as a self as one discerns it more and more, that very discernment of it is what prohibits the assumption of self.

### Has Ven Nyanamoli talked about the anapanasati sutra, right mindfulness and right concentration?

I find his talks advanced and a bit tough to follow.  It’s my fault, I just find it like trying to learn quantum mechanics from listening to a fast conversation between two people who are already experts in quantum mechanics.

But I have read his two books and I like most of what he says.  But he says focusing meditations are not what I’m supposed to be doing.

Instead I should be trying to get right view, or just sit and endure sitting there without doing anything in the present moment.  I know I’m butchering his instructions, but you get what I’m talking about - I’m not supposed to sit there and focus on my breath or whatever.

But unless I’m misinterpreting his definition of “focusing meditation”, didn’t the Buddha teach being in the present moment with right mindfulness and right effort, and being aware of the breath in a one pointed way, and doing that all the way to jhana?  Isn’t that how the Buddha himself reached enlightenment?

Am I missing something obvious here?  Thanks very much for your insights.

Sorry, autocorrect changed ‘sutra’ to sutra in the title.

    >didn’t the Buddha teach being in the present moment with right mindfulness and right effort, and being aware of the breath in a one pointed way, and doing that all the way to jhana?  Isn’t that how the Buddha himself reached enlightenment?

    In brief, no, he did not, assuming we agree that the Suttas are the only reliable guide and put aside the Commentarial notions that have seeped into contemporary views of meditation.

    Hypothetically, if you took somebody who has never heard a word about Buddhism or meditation at all and made them go through the early texts, they would 100% not end up with the idea that the Buddha taught one pointed focusing on one's breath (which is not what Anapanasati is). They would instead conclude that the Buddha mainly taught *contempation* of wholesome and unwholesome phenomena, and that samatha and jhānas are a result of that. 

    They would also realize that Anapanasati cannot possibly be something *completely different* than that right reflection and thinking which he taught 99% of the time, so they would interpret the meagre amount of occurrences Anapanasati in light of that other 99%, instead of the other way around as it is today. Anapanasati, although highly praised by the Buddha in only a handful of Suttas, is nowhere near a frequent mention, which is vastly incongruent with how many people today cannot conceive of "meditation" that does not involve the breath.

    In fact, there is evidence to think that the Buddha only intended Anapanasati for advanced practitioners (i.e. with the Right View), given the assembly of exclusively Noble Ones that received the Anapanasati Sutta, and the fact that he discouraged his own son from doing Anapanasati before he was ready, in MN 62. And what you most certainly won't find anywhere is an instance of him instructing laypeople (i.e. non-renunciates) on Anapanasati as it's done today.

    Furthermore, the  "meditation" for abandoning the hindrances and entering jhāna that recurs all over the Suttas, unlike Anapanasati that is extremely rare in comparison and doesn't occur in explicit connection to jhāna, is *contemplating and reflecting* on the dangers of sensual desire and unwholesome states.

    "One-pointedness" for ekaggatā and "absorption" for jhāna are also completely inaccurate renderings, and thus ideas too. These have become ingrained due to to translators and Buddhist teachers reverse-engineering the Dhamma— by means of the views of what jhāna/meditation was *already* assumed to be in times when nobody acknowledged that the Commentaries don't agree with the Suttas. And most of them continue to spread those ideas even now, despite often labeling themselves as early Buddhists who reject later interpretations.

    "Agga" (from eka-agga, "one point") never actually means "point" in *any* context in Pāli. It means "tip; peak" or even "place". And "jhāna" (from the Pāli *jhāyati*) actually means "[1. to meditate, think upon, contemplate](https://obo.genaud.net/backmatter/glossology/pali_roots.htm#Jh)". Plus, the English word "meditation" itself had nothing to do with one-pointed focusing 2 centuries ago, before Buddhism (*of the Commentaries*) made its way into the West. The latin word from which "meditation" is derived means "to think or reflect upon, consider, design, purpose, intend", not "observe physical sensations exclusively until you lose all reflective awareness".

    Thus, when the Buddha told monks "Monks, meditate (do-jhāna), do not be negligent!", as he frequently did, he was literally talking about *contemplating rightly*, which is what results in Right Samādhi when there is Right View (see DN 2, MN 19, MN 20, MN 39, MN 106, SN 35.246... the list goes on.)

    So, technically, you don't need to sit down and literally "do nothing" the whole time. If you want to "meditate" even if you don't have the Right View yet, you simply do precisely what that word actually means, and which the Buddha instructed innumerable times: 

    >Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu resorts to a secluded resting place: the forest, the root of a tree, a mountain, a ravine, a hillside cave, a charnel ground, a jungle thicket, an open space, a heap of straw.

    >“On returning from his almsround, after his meal he sits down, folding his legs crosswise, setting his body erect and establishing mindfulness before him. Abandoning covetousness for the world, he abides with a mind free from covetousness; he purifies his mind from covetousness. Abandoning ill will and hatred, he abides with a mind free from ill will, compassionate for the welfare of all living beings...
    —MN 39

    And how does he do this?

    >...bhikkhus, a noble disciple __considers__ thus: ‘Sensual pleasures here and now and sensual pleasures in lives to come, sensual perceptions here and now and sensual perceptions in lives to come—both alike are Māra’s realm, Māra’s domain, Māra’s bait, Māra’s hunting ground. On account of them, these evil unwholesome mental states such as covetousness, ill will, and aggression arise, and they constitute an obstruction to a noble disciple in training here. Suppose I were to abide with a mind abundant and exalted, having transcended the world and made a firm determination with the mind. When I do so, there will be no more evil unwholesome mental states such as covetousness, ill will, and presumption in me, and with the abandoning of them my mind will be unlimited, immeasurable, and well developed.’ When he practises in this way and frequently abides thus, his mind acquires confidence in this base. Once there is full confidence, he either attains to the imperturbable __(=up to the fourth jhāna or the dimension of infinite space)__.
    —MN 106

    *(incidentally, synonymous language permeates the entire Anapanasati instruction—"he __understands/discerns/reflects upon/considers__ his breathing in this way and that way", not "he focuses on its (irrelevant) sensations").

    
    And the catch is, you *need* to have purified your behavior and livelihood from those same unwholesome things for these contemplations to yield any significant result, because otherwise your considering of sensuality as a trap is not genuine, evidenced by the fact that you still go and pursue it when you're not meditating. Hence the necessity of virtue, celibacy and gradual training that we often emphasize.

    This [essay](https://www.hillsidehermitage.org/sila-is-samadhi/) goes into further detail on the type of contemplation that can result in the samādhi that the Suttas portray.

        One additional remark I didn't include:
        Note that MN 106 quoted above goes all the way up to the *base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception*, and this is probably the only Sutta where the Buddha gives explicit instructions on how to reach the formless states. And in every single case, this hypothetical monk—who nobody can deny is doing full-on samatha—does so by frequently __considering/reflecting__ on the right themes until the mind is confident in them.

        What is then to be said of someone who, under the pretext of samatha, wants to *deactivate* their capacity to reflect upon anything by focusing on tactile sensations of breathing and thus suppposedly reach the first jhāna.

    I don't use translations; I read the Pāli directly.

    But when I have to quote in English, I usually use Bhikkhu Bodhi's translations for convenience, and also because he tends to be more loyal to the Pāli. I still often make amendments on certain terms, since he uses Commentarial/Abhidhamma/Visuddhimagga concepts to interpret things and sometimes skews his renderings so that it all fits his overall view (especially when it comes to rebirth, paṭiccasamuppāda and meditation). 

    Every translation is an interpretation to a degree, but one should take any seemingly necessary deviations from the Pāli as a sign that *one's interpretation* is wrong, rather than as a sign that the Buddha meant one thing but said another (or could not come up with a more accurate term) and then distort the entire Canon accordingly. A good example of this the various translations of "vitakkavicāra", whose meaning is actually as unambiguous as it gets.

    Well, perhaps "discouraged" is not the right word. The point was that Rāhula asked him solely about Anapanasati, and he replied with all these other things instead and left Anapanasati for the very end. 

    The Buddha never answered something other than what he was asked without a good reason. So, at minimum, he was implying to Rāhula that he also needs to understand the principle behind these other practices; at most, he was telling them he needs to learn how to do them *before* Anapanasati. And both scenarios are in conflict with the common idea of Anapanasati as the core of the practice, *the* meditation everyone should be doing (another notion from the Commentaries and nowhere found in the Suttas), and everything else as merely complementary or even optional. 

    Notice especially the very first thing he starts with: "be like earth, so that agreeable and disagreeble things will not overwhelm your mind". This is crucial because it's the principle behind *any* correct meditation, which is why he mentions it first, and it's exactly what people miss when they do Anapanasati as a form of focusing. They're using it to run away from agreeable and disagreeable things and towards the random breath sensations ("stopping the mind-wandering"), and not using the *memory/context* (sati) of the kāya-saṅkhāra as a basis to "be like earth" in the face of pleasure and pain—which are experienced precisely through  that very "mind-wandering" they so crave to get rid of.

    This means that it's not even "pure samatha" as it's sometimes claimed, because samatha is about being totally undisturbed by anything like the earth (which is why it's not *exactly* identical with vipassanā, but obviously the two are inseparable). Samatha is not about *not perceiving* those pressures, in which case, how would you even know you're truly calm and undisturbed.

    On a similar note, see what you need to to *before* practicing mettā in AN 8.63. People instead tend to practice mettā __because__ their mind cannot remain internally steady in the face of displeasure/annoyance, so they seek to contrive this artificial feeling of pleasure and happiness to cover up the displeasure ASAP, because if they don't, they will eventually crack and indulge in ill-will. But the Buddha says here, similar to MN 62, that you must be unmoved by the pressuring things *first*, and not use mettā to get rid of them.

    And because people take it the wrong way around, it all remains a mere-cover up that doesn't address the underlying problem. So even after a lifetime of Anapanasati, mettā, or whatever, defilements would come back if they stopped meditating for a while (and deep down they know, which is why they cling to their formal meditation sessions as a sacred ritual).

    >...that seem to talk about focusing on the breath in some way.. are not correct in that they are instructions based on a tiny sliver of the suttas and more aimed at expert monastics?

    No, not quite. The point is more nuanced than that, so sometimes people don't fully get it. Those instructions are not correct because they are not what Anapanasati is, given that they're based on a notion of what __sati__ is that does not agree with the Suttas. In other words, we're saying nobody who wants to practice Buddhism needs to do that, and an "expert" even less so.

    On the other hand, Anapanasati as taught in the Suttas, which most certainly should be practiced by one with the Right View, is not about focusing, but about what literally everything else the Buddha expounded on is about—contemplation and discernment of the relevant things (=not bodily sensations). And it being a form of contemplation is exactly why it requires the Right View to provide the rewards the Buddha spoke so highly about.  

    If Anapanasati—the *"abiding of the Noble Ones and of the Tathāgata"* as described in SN 54.11—were about focusing, anyone at all could obtain right mindfulness and right samādhi if they just follow a specific set of instructions, and this is exactly the modern belief that is not supported by the Suttas. If it really worked like that, you'd expect him to be handing those instructions out like free alms for the poor, but he never did. Not once do we see the Buddha teaching Anapanasati to laypeople *at all*, let alone those who were not celibate and were not stream enterers.

    
    >Most Buddhists are saying one thing, and you and Ajahn Nyanamoli are saying a different thing.  Both sides can’t really be correct.  The simplest solution is that the majority is correct, but what they’re saying doesn’t align with the suttas.  This is a strange situation.

    And that shouldn't be a deterrent if one is using the correct criteria to determine what's right or wrong (to the limited extent that it's available even without the Right View).

    All you need to ask yourself is: do you *see* how focusing on your breath mechanically (which, to repeat, is not Anapanasati) will free you from suffering, or does it only provide a temporary relief from it by *preventing* the things that cause suffering from coming to you? 

    Do you *know* that being tremendously skilled in focusing will prevent the severe pain of sickness, aging and death from affecting you? Isn't that already assuming that those overwhelming experiences will manifest in the way *you* expect them to, thus giving you the necessary "space" to focus away from them?

    With death especially, the whole point of it as that you *can't* look away to something else to lessen the pain anymore, hence the famous simile the Buddha gave of the four mountains crushing you from every direction. It's your mind and the mental suffering (which, incidentally, people wrongly assume ends when the heart stops beating). No more objects of your senses to hide behind—nothing else to focus on.

    "Like an approaching mass of fire,
    are death, sickness and aging.
    There is no power to oppose it,
    no speed's enough to flee."
    —Sirimaṇḍa-Theragātha

    Actual Anapanasati paired with the Right View, on the other hand, would free one from death once and for all.

    > Only in that dozens of Thai forest teachers say that if my sila is good and I focus on my breath in the right way for long enough, and apply right effort to bring up the seven factors of enlightenment, then samadhi will happen which is yoked with vippassana and the resulting insights will free me from suffering to some degree.  Supposedly.  

    Yes, and that sounds good enough to most people. The problem is that, as the Buddha often emphasized, hearsay and tradition should not be the guides for one's practice. Of course, some degree of faith is necessary, but not to the point where you "just do it" and have not clarified your views into first of all what freedom actually is, and secondly how this will lead you to it.

    Even as an unlightened person who doesn't know what Nibbāna is, one needs to know *why* what one is practicing is at least most likely to be right and how it's freeing one. Fundamentally, suffering is caused by wrong view, and what these techniques do is take your *existing* views and run with them, because you're not supposed to be thinking and questioning such things but only watching the breath, or whatever focusing object you might be instructed.

    And any insights you might get from it will not change your actual *views*. You might change your *opinions* about certain things, but psychotherapy also helps with that. Views are much more fundamental, on the level of *why* are you even practicing anything in the first place, so your views are actually lurking untouched *behind* all that focusing and pleasure of the wrong kind. You can see that people often describe their insights as "special experiences", and none of that is changing the view behind it all.

    You'd also see that the amount of suffering it will permanently have allayed when you skip your daily dose of these practices for a good while is about the same as when adhering to literally any religion, that makes you be more careful with your actions and attitudes. That's the only permanent change that's really occurring, and it wasn't even because of the focusing per se.  People don't realize how much their serious commitment to meditation techniques is simply getting them to be more restrained, and that *that's* why they suffer less.

    Furthermore, it's good to note that when one speaks about "the tradition", even specific subsets like the Thai Forest or any other, the sense of uniformity is actually illusory. They may agree on the focusing as a principle, but even then they disagree on what degree of it is necessary, and on other points that are not as minor as people think. Therefore, it's not even an "us vs. the rest" thing, as if  "the rest" were actually on the same page except on the surface. And people who practice these techniques usually turn a blind eye to that, because syncretism is always the easier route.

    What the myriad of teachers describe are not "different takes on the same thing"—there are irreparable discrepancies on doctrinal points from teacher to teacher that would simply not occur within the Noble Saṅgha. 

    *“What do you think, Ānanda? These things that I have taught you after directly knowing them—that is, the four foundations of mindfulness, the four right kinds of striving, the four bases for spiritual power, the five faculties, the five powers, the seven enlightenment factors, the Noble Eightfold Path—do you see, Ānanda, __even two bhikkhus__ who make differing assertions about these things?”
    “No, venerable sir, I do not see even two bhikkhus who make differing assertions about these things.* —[MN 104](suttacentral.net/mn104/en/bodhi)

    

    

    
    >"Isn't that already assuming that those overwhelming experiences will manifest in the way you expect them to, thus giving you the necessary "space" to focus away from them?"

    >I don’t quite follow this, I’m interested in reading an expansion or unpacking of this.

    This is basically a phenomenological description of how a focusing practice wrongly attempts to deal with suffering. With the ordinary issues and concerns in your life that make you suffer, you always have a bit of room to block them from your awareness and forget about them, by attending to something else instead. A whole gamut of things can serve as that "something else"—drugs, relationships, food, psychology, positive affirmations, God, entertainment, a focusing object. This is essentially how sensuality works. 

    As the Buddha said in SN 36.6, when a puthujjana is struck with suffering, he knows of no other way to escape it other than to replace it with pleasure. Following the same tendency in another form, when your mind thinks of something unpleasant, you immediately shut it off by focusing on a different object to get a relief, and you just keep doing that until all you have is the chosen object. You then feel pleasure because the pain is gone, like someone who lies down on a perfectly comfortable mattress. It's not the pleasure of someone who abandoned craving against pain.

    Hence the point I made: death or any severe form of displeasure, even the death of a loved one before your own, is called "severe" precisely because you have no room to shy away from it and find a mental hiding spot. It takes over your experience completely and doesn't allow you to look away.

    Therefore, to put it concisely, the only way to not suffer internally even in the face of extreme displeasure, which is what everyone wants, is for the mind to be at peace without having to replace that displeasure, so that *while facing it*, there is no anguish.

    In [MN 125](https://suttacentral.net/MN125/en/sujato), the Buddha compares a battle-elephant that can withstand blows in battle without flinching with the developed mind that results from the right practice. The Gradual Training and Right Mindfulness train the mind to be just like that, and focusing, ironically, is training the mind to be more tender and often shirk back from things that it could withstand in the past, so it develops neither samatha (imperturbability) nor vipassanā. 

    (And just to be clear: none of this means you need to go and torture your body. Withstanding pain refers to the mental kind of not getting what you want, or getting what you don't want. That's what death is when taken to the utmost, so bodily endurance alone will not train you for that. Even if you do ascetic practices, it's to train the mind, not the body.)

    If you want to sit and practice, you don't need to "do nothing" literally. Ajahn phrases it like that because, to someone who is used to always having some technique to distract them from their own mind and feelings, this feels like "nothing", and it can be overwhelming because you come face to face with what you actually have inside for the first time.

    When you're alone with nothing to do, you should make effort to ponder on the Suttas, think about what views you may have that may be preventing you from understanding them, see if there's anything you can improve in terms of your restraint, and contemplate to what degree your practice has truly *freed you from* (not covered up) severe forms of suffering, and your greatest fears and worries. Eventually, that will become "concrete" enough, and you'll see that there's a mountain of real work yet to be done.

    >But Anapanasati is for the fulfillment of the Satipatthana, right, just with breath as peripheral anchor while attending to and contemplating them?

    More accurately, the breath is a peripheral anchor to let the senses [pull as hard as they want without actually being allowed to reach their intended targets](https://suttacentral.net/SN35.247/en/sujato), and the four satipaṭṭhānas are inherently implied in that for one with the Right View, although later on the noble disciple can choose to emphasize one of them more (See SN 54.6, "How to Calm Your Mind" chapter in Dhamma within Reach, and "Recollectedness of Breathing and Calming of Aversion" in the newer Jhāna Book from AN, as well as their respective talks on the channel).

    >And these trainees, who were still aspiring and hadn't attained security yet, weren't sotapannas with Right View yet were they?

    No, the word "trainee" (sekha) in Pāli always refers to sotapannas or higher (they "aspire" to the security *because they see* that other shore). This fact alone reflects the point we often make that the "training" *starts* with the Right View, and before that one is more like trying to rescue oneself from the incoming misfortune of training and advancing further in the Eightfold Wrong Path ("aṭṭhaṅgiko micchāmaggo" discussed many times in the Suttas), which starts with none other than the lack of knowledge of the Four Noble Truths (wrong view).

    I'd recommend to revisit as many Suttas as you can with this actual meaning of "trainee" in mind in case you were not aware of it before.

    Nevertheless, the Buddha in the Sutta you cite *does* advice monks who are newly ordained (whose separate mention proves that they were still not "trainees" despite having fully commited to the holy life) to practice the four satipaṭṭhānas before the Right View. What needs to be kept in mind is what the Buddha said is the prerequisite for the four satipaṭṭhānas, which gives one a hint of why they are never taught to laypeople who are not *already* stream enterers at least (and even that was rare—Anāthapiṇḍika is moved to tears on account of hearing a discourse on the six senses for the first time in MN 146, and Nakula's Father who was also a stream enterer was exhorted on the five aggregates in SN 22.1)

    >But, Master Gotama, what things, when developed and cultivated, fulfil the four establishments of mindfulness?”

    >“The three kinds of good conduct, Kuṇḍaliya, when developed and cultivated, fulfil the four establishments of mindfulness."

    >But, Master Gotama, what things, when developed and cultivated, fulfil the three kinds of good conduct?” 

    >“Restraint of the sense faculties, Kuṇḍaliya, when developed and cultivated, fulfils the three kinds of good conduct. [i.e., he's not just referring to the 5 precepts. Not even the 8 or 10, for that matter]

    —SN 46.6 (AN 10.61 says the same)

    (And obviously the point is the restraint, not the robe and shaven head)

    Also, see the point I made on this thread about Rāhula, the Buddha's own son who was then a novice, in MN 62. He was essentially being exhorted on the more rudimentary four satipaṭṭhānas, and Ānāpānasati was left for the very end. AN 8.63 is about how your mind needs to be "unmoved by unskilful states" (which obviously rules out actions by body and speech out of such states) before you can really start practicing things like the brahmavihāras an—also not taught to laypeople in the Buddha's time—and satipaṭṭhānas. Though one may think even non-celibate laypeople should be perfectly able to generate warm feelings for others, mettā, which is undebatably perfect friendliness and absence of hatred, is much closer to the complete dispassion of the first jhāna than people realize.

    >They give up these *__five__* hindrances, corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom.

    >Then they meditate with a mind endowed with friendliness towards the first, second, third, and fourth directions. Below, across, everywhere, __to [the] Allness__ (sabbattatāya)—they __dwell having pervaded__ (pharitvā viharati) the world __consisting of [the] All__ (sabbāvant) with a mind that is abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.

    —DN 25 (my own, literal as possible translation)

    Compare this with a popular rendering:

    >Then they meditate spreading a heart full of love to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of love to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.

    Which has very different implications. Firstly, there is a tinge of the first hindrance not having been abandoned, and secondly, the "and to the second, and to the third...", showing that the idea of a "process of spreading" is being read into the Pāli, which only says "thus the first, thus the second..." which there is no reason not to understand as "all simultaneously", coupled with the "they __spread__ a heart...", whereas  the Pāli really says "they *dwell having spread/pervaded*". 

    Regarding what my translation says about "the All", this is eseentially what Ajahn Nyanamoli has made sure to explain in the videos addressing Brahmavihāra (search for "Brahmavihara", "metta", "friendliness" and the second anapanasati talk I mentioned abiove on the channel), that the non-ill will is to be fundamentally directed towards one's own senses (the All) so as to apply on the right level, whereas "pervading individual people with love" fails to do so, and always entails that "process" of well-wishing that was read into the second translation above.

    The "having pervaded" as opposed to the "they spread" part also proves the same point essentially: it is by seeing that entire "All"—which does not *take time*, only discernment—that the friendliness starts applying to the whole world/All as soon as one "sees" it and directs that attitude towards it.  ("sign of the mind" we often talk about is pretty much what allows one to recognize the All). It is therefore inherently a completely detached, dispassionate and thus *unlimited* attitude, as opposed of "going towards" things which is what you're doing when you're "spreading" to beings one by one. And this does not change the fact that the term "friendliness" is perfectly accurate to describe the attitude too.

    
    See [this reply](https://reddit.com/comments/17s4wti/comment/k8rgard) on what causes one to not be able to recognize the "All" properly, which again connects with the point in AN 8.63 about what needs to be done *before* practicing mettā.

    (I know half of the reply was not directly related to your question, but in the process of writing it occured to me, so I'll probably be recycling it as the nucleus of a future essay on mettā. It's not totally unrelated anyway).

    Also, forgot to bring up the fact that the satipaṭṭhāna refrain always says "he abides independent, not holding anything in the world". This is often taken to be a simple matter of choice, more or less regardless of what one does "off the cushion", but ultimately "not holding anything in the world" *starts* on the level one's actions, and of course a commitment to morality and ethics is not enough to avoid unwholesome. Hence the necessity of purity in regard to the 3 doors for satipaṭṭhāna to have a real foundation.

    > That may be true, but overdoing sense deprivation before you are ready will end up being counter productive.

    "Overdoing sense deprivation" at any point is counterproductive, and it's not what Ajahn Nyanamoli is teaching. I'm assuming you're not referring to keeping the precepts and not seeking sense pleasures as "deprivation", which would be absurd. Being unable to see the difference between sense restraint and sense deprivation is being unable to see the Middle Way.

    Here's what the Buddha had to say on breaking sense restraint:

    >It would be better, bhikkhus, for the eye faculty to be lacerated by a red-hot iron pin burning, blazing, and glowing, than for one to grasp the signs and features of a form cognizable by the eye. For if consciousness should stand tied to gratification in the signs and features, and if one should die on that occasion, it is possible that one will go to one of two destinations: hell or the animal realm. Having seen this danger, I speak thus.

    >“It would be better, bhikkhus, for the ear faculty to be lacerated by a sharp iron stake burning, blazing, and glowing, than for one to grasp signs and features in a sound cognizable by the ear. For if consciousness should stand tied to gratification in the sign or in the features, and if one should die on that occasion, it is possible that one will go to one of two destinations: hell or the animal realm. Having seen this danger, I speak thus...
    —SN 35.235

    There's a universe of difference between "not grasping signs and features" and "sense deprivation", and Ajahn Nyanamoli expounds on this incessantly in different ways, to the point of (necessary) redundancy, because the distinction mostly eludes people, especially those who haven't gotten used to correct restraint yet, for whom it will feel like they need to deny the entire world and go blind and deaf to be perfectly restrained. Sense restraint, on the other hand, can never be overdone, just like mindfulness cannot.

    What the Buddha said to someone who seriously broke his commitment to restraint (the first monk who broke the 1st pārājika):

    >Haven’t I in many ways taught the abandoning of sensual pleasures, the full understanding of the perceptions of sensual pleasure, the removal of thirst for sensual pleasure, the elimination of thoughts of sensual pleasure, the stilling of the fevers of sensual pleasure? It would be better, foolish man, for your penis to enter the mouth of a highly venomous snake than to enter a woman. It would be better for your penis to enter the mouth of a black snake than to enter a woman. It would be better for your penis to enter a blazing charcoal pit than to enter a woman. Why is that? For although it might cause death or death-like suffering, it would not cause you to be reborn in a bad destination. But this might. Foolish man, you have practiced what is contrary to the true Teaching, the common practice, the low practice, the coarse practice, that which ends with a wash, that which is done in private, that which is done wherever there are couples. You are the forerunner, the first performer of many unwholesome things. This will affect people’s confidence, and cause some to lose it.”

    > Of course we should strive to grasp at no forms, but being able to do this is a gradual development. I think some leeway in sense restraint is acceptable as someone is developing on the path. 

    You seem to be making a leap from the inevitable fact that, sure enough, one's restraint will not be perfect overnight, with *justifying* unrestrained actions and presenting them as compatible with the path, and these are earth and sky.

    Firstly, you can't be perfectly sense restrained overnight no matter how hard you try and how many things you refuse to perceive, because sense restraint is a matter of right mindfulness and discernment, and not of blind avoidance of everything. Renouncing everything suddenly and locking yourself in a cave is rooted in aversion most of the time, so it's actually a *breach* of sense restraint. It's a lazy attempt to take a shortcut, and leads to another form of craving instead.

    What everyone can certainly do is abandon *actions* that they obviously know are rooted in desire and aversion, and this is covered ideally by the Eight Precepts (7 if one meal a day is not an option). 

    Now of course, not everyone can take them on all at once, but if they allow themselves to hold a *view* that they can still practice towards Nibbāna with subpar virtue, they'd be shooting themselves in the foot big time, because it's almost guaranteed that they'll find a comfort zone in a level that's far from sufficient. So what one needs to do is tell people the truth—that they can't have their cake and eat it too—and they will decide for themselves how far to go. And at the end of the day, if the practice does not give the result they expected, they won't be left wondering why.

    It can be compared to a drug addiction. The average addict will undoubtedly not be able to quit cold turkey, but if you diminish his sense of urgency to quit by telling him that it's not *that* bad, and he can be healthy enough if he just exercises and eats better, he likely won't be able to quit all the way ever, or at least not soon enough. 

    With the addiction to sensuality it's even worse of course, because there's a whole thicket of deeply ingrained views ensuring that it's not abandoned. Give yourself a chance not to swim against that torrent as hard as you can, and you're done. It may take you years and you may slip sometimes at first, but you can't *not* be giving it your 100%, especially as a layperson in modern times flooded with temptations, and still reach the other shore. That'd be wishful thinking, based on not even seeing the magnitude of one's predicament.

    >But what would you say to an addict who tries to quit cold turkey and becomes severely distraught. Would you tell them to take a step back and approach the issue more gradually?

    Sure, but never to *excuse* his inability to quit cold turkey through a view. That's why the Suttas speak of a "sense of shame and fear of wrong doing". Nobody starts perfect, but the closest to perfection initially is having this quality to the greatest possible degree. It may be rather jarring to feel perpetually inadequate, but one shouldn't expect the practice to be pleasant right off the bat, because every *real* increase in abandonment of the drug will produce more withdrawal symptoms. 

    
    >Reduce the amount of addictive substances they are taking and spend more time developing the Eight Fold Path, etc, with the understanding that as one develops, their capacity to let go of the addiction will improve?

    This is mainly where I don't agree. Firstly, there is no Noble Eightfold Path for one without Right View. Secondly, even for a Noble individual, there would be no partaking in the Eightfold Path if they fell into a view that they're practicing it despite not being sufficiently restrained (which is why they wouldn't believe such a thing; at best they would transparently admit that they've derailed from the path temporarily). So rather than watering down what the path is, one should be clear that it won't be accessible until one's virtue and behavior is brought in order. If this recognition is compromised, any "understanding" that comes will be based on wrong view.

    
    >But then you say there’s a risk of becoming complacent. So how does one strike that balance?

    By turning up the sense of urgency to the max, and keeping the eyes on the actual prize, without falling for a prize that presents itself as more accessible. You won't get there right away for sure, but you will not fool yourself, and that's what matters most.

    > But I also think it’s counterproductive to expect or force a result that’s not ready to be had.

    Yes, but the problem is one cannot be the one *deciding* how much is ready to be had, because one's judgement is thoroughly infected with ignorance. So what one needs to do is maintain the honest recognition that there is no practice happening yet, and then one won't have to be "forcing" anything. The "speed" of abandonment will adjust itself automatically. If within this container, an option to abandon something comes to mind, it's because you *can* do it without tightening too much, although you may not *want to* because it'll hurt.  Most importantly, one will allow no room to settle prematurely on something that seems like the path (to one's ignorance) but isn't, which is all too likely to happen.

    Fundamentally, one has to abandon the view that one can determine what is too tight and what is too loose before stream entry (and the monk who was given this lute simile was most likely at that level at least). It's not something that depends on an opinion or view. For a puthujjana, those will always be affected with avijjā, which seeks to preserve itself in the sneakiest ways at any cost.

    >and then practice other aspects of The Path so that your capacity to reduce increases further.

    The issue is, there are no "other aspects" that don't rely on the abandonment of what is unskillful in word and deed *beforehand*. If you're referring to mindfulness and meditation, that *presupposes* purity of behavior. Meditation that operates within and excuses non-restraint only fuels wrong view. So at that point, a person's "meditation" (in the correct sense of that word) should be to reflect on how to go about purifying their behavior, how many unskillful things they still need to give up, and why they should be giving them up.

    Yes, I anticipated that common argument. The thing people overlook with it is that all these stream enterer laypeople you read about in the Suttas became enlightened after *talking to the Buddha for the first time*. They didn't need to spend years building up their practice. That's not due to some magical cause, but because that's how much those people's mind's were already not *as* passionate for sensual pleasures, which is what determines how well it will "absorb the dye" of the Noble Truths. And if you read closely, you see exactly what the Buddha did before teaching them the core of the Dhamma.

    >Then the Blessed One gave the householder Upāli progressive instruction, that is, talk on giving, talk on virtue, talk on the heavens; __he explained the danger, degradation, and defilement in sensual pleasures and the blessing of renunciation. When he knew that the householder Upāli’s mind was ready, receptive, free from hindrances__, elated, and confident, he expounded to him the teaching special to the Buddhas: suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path. Just as a clean cloth with all marks removed would take dye evenly, so too, while the householder Upāli sat there, the spotless immaculate vision of the Dhamma arose in him: “All that is subject to arising is subject to cessation.”
    —[MN 56](https://suttacentral.net/MN56/en/BODHI)

    "Free from hindrances", the foremost of which is sensual desire, means that the person's mind was able to, at that time at least, *completely* abandon any interest in sense pleasures from the very bottom of their being (since that "bottom" is where the true hindrances are). They didn't just stop thinking about sensuality for 30 minutes of formal sitting or a 10 day retreat. In other words, you could say that person was internally a complete renunciate at that moment.

    So, if a person has spent years practicing, knows *dozens* of Suttas (those laypeople got only one) and knows more details about Buddhism than even some monks back in the day and yet are still not stream enterers , it's because their mind is not as naturally clean as these laypeople's. That means they will have to spend potentially years drying up their mind from the moisture of sensuality to the best of their ability, which means strict virtue and restraint to eventually, to get to the point these people were *already* at, and light the fire of true wisdom. 

    There is no other hidden reason for failing to understand the Dhamma when you hear it in so much detail apart from the mind not being sufficiently confident in renunciation, which is what determines the actual hindrances. (Note incidentally that for these people there were no concentration techniques involved to purify the mind).

    Lastly, the Sutta says this man was drinking *as* a stream enterer. One should not think that a stream enterer's external engagement with sensuality in any way compares to what's happening with a puthujjana internally.

    What people need to be told is the harsh truth: that the Dhamma is out of bounds for whoever is not willing to give up sensual pleasures. The majority of people will not be able to stomach this, and that's fine, because it means that at least sometime later on, if they ever decide to take up the practice, they will be clear about what it is and won't be cheating themselves with a watered down version of it. 

    The people who reject the instruction forever when you tell them this will do so because they were not ready to hear it to begin with, and even then it's better for them to dismiss it and take up some other practice, and at least not forsake the undistorted recognition of Dhamma as Dhamma, whether they agree with it or not. The Buddha didn't teach the Dhamma for the majority—he even refused to teach at all until he saw a handful of beings with little dust in their eyes.

    If someone *is* able to stomach this, then the strength of their faculties will by itself take care of how quickly they will be able to give up their addiction. It's a much more uncomfortable route than believing the Dhamma is compatible with at least a bit of sensuality, and will involve uncertainty, remorse and internal conflicts more often than not, but that's the comparatively microscopic price to pay for actual liberation.

    Also, when people have mental breakdowns after trying too hard to be restrained, that because they were acting out of craving and impulsiveness, even if they were living naked under a bridge, eating once a month from a dumpster. Correct sense restraint (i.e., with discernment) will result in a lot of (necessary) internal discomfort, but breakdowns and similar would only happen when there's been craving involved. Thus, no amount of it can bring bad results if done properly.

    The Suttas are abundantly clear about this if one reads them honestly. A few specific examples that stand out:

    >"Now these three similes occurred to me spontaneously, never heard before. Suppose there were a wet sappy piece of wood lying in water, and a man came with an upper fire-stick, thinking: ‘I shall light a fire, I shall produce heat.’ What do you think, Aggivessana? Could the man light a fire and produce heat by taking the upper fire-stick and rubbing it against the wet sappy piece of wood lying in the water?”

    >“No, Master Gotama. Why not? Because it is a wet sappy piece of wood, and it is lying in water. Eventually the man
    would reap only weariness and disappointment.”

    >“So too, Aggivessana, as to those recluses and brahmins who still __do not live bodily withdrawn from sensual pleasures, and whose sensual desire, affection, infatuation, thirst, and fever for sensual pleasures has not been fully abandoned and allayed internally,__ even if those good recluses and brahmins feel painful, racking, piercing feelings due to exertion, they are incapable of knowledge and vision and supreme enlightenment; and even if those good recluses and brahmins do not feel painful, racking, piercing feelings due to exertion, __they are incapable of knowledge and vision and supreme enlightenment.__ This was the first simile that occurred to me spontaneously, never heard before.

    And that's only a short selection.

    >Also, are you saying a drug addict who cannot give up their addict cannot make progress on the Dhamma path?

    More accurately, a drug addict has made progress on the Dhamma path *to the degree* they have given up their addiction. There is no measure of progress *apart* from that because Dhamma *is* non-greed, non-aversion, and non-delusion. 

    And the addict has acquired something worse than the addiction itself if they develop a view that *excuses* their not giving it up as soon as possible. Even though the person without that view—who transparently acknowledges that no amount of the drug is OK—may initially stumble in their attempts at giving the drug up entirely, it's a completely different situation happening in their mind. As the Buddha said, wrong view is by far the most pernicious of all unwholesome things.

### Daily Routine

What would be the ideal daily routine for someone on a holiday with a whole month to devote themselves to the practice of Dhamma, while adhering to the precepts, practicing restraint, and maintaining moderation in eating, according to Bhikkhu Nyanamoli's teachings? How can one structure their day to get the right view and make the most of this extended period of Dhamma practice?

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/170jti5/daily_routine/k3ps4vo/)** _2023-10-06 13:49:31:

    Having a routine or not is not what determines one success. If a person has the tendency to procrastinate, not do things they know they should do or get easily distracted, then establishing a routine could be useful. But if that's not the case, then the desire for a routine could be a sign of an achievement-oriented mindset that's not in line with how progress in the Dhamma actually works.

    Development in the Dhamma is measured by how much one is incapable of suffering amidst suffering, and that criterion, or what that even means, is inherently not seen by one without the Right View. 

    Thus, the measurable results that such a person  could be hoping for at the end of their adherence to a schedule will necessarily be things that don't pertain to the ultimate goal,  such as intellectual familiarity with the teaching, or the more "palpable" yet mundane return on investment that is obtained from wrong meditation. It is already too easy to confuse these things with real understanding, and not challenging the assumptions behind one's insistence on a routine can make that mistake even more likely.

### How do 'Choiceless Awareness,' 'Open Awareness,' and 'Do Nothing' align with Nyanamoli's Mindfulness Approach to Peripheral Awareness?

Hello everyone, I'm seeking some insights.

When Nyanamoli discusses the correct approach to maintaining our mental state—avoiding excessive focus (absorption) while retaining peripheral or contextual awareness— which mindfulness practices or teachers, such as 'choiceless awareness,' 'open awareness,' or 'do nothing,' closely align with Nyanamoli's concept of peripheral awareness? I'm in search of an alternative explanation of Nyanamoli's idea to gain a better understanding, specifically only in the context of establishing mindfulness.

Thanks!

&#x200B;

EDIT:  

Perhaps I have expressed myself in a confusing manner. I am not referring to comparing the entire practice of "choiceless awareness" or "do nothing" or any other practice with Nyanamoli's peripheral awareness/contextual awareness. Rather, I am referring to whether the way peripheral awareness is explained is similar to that of other teachers who use different terminology, regardless of what you do with what you are aware of during meditation; that would not be the subject of comparison in this case.

For example, on the contrary, imagine a teacher who asserts that attention should be very focused on the object and seek absorption. An example of this would be to say that Pa-Auk understands mindfulness in the same way as this imaginary teacher.

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/16yjuh1/how_do_choiceless_awareness_open_awareness_and_do/k3dx24w/)** _2023-10-04 04:13:06:

    It would be misleading to draw comparisons based on the technicalities of how the practice of mindfulness is explained, because there's nothing in that which inherently guarantees that the relevant approach will be in line with the Dhamma. Such technicalities are secondary.

    To illustrate, someone could easily extract a "system" from HH teachings that would in the letter be very similar to what some "choiceless awareness" teacher says, who also happens to encourage that same awareness during sexual intercourse, for instance, as opposed to presenting that as antithetical to the development of right awareness (which is made "right" by none other than the abandonment of unwholesome as its foundation).

    On the other hand, there could hypothetically be a teacher who does not speak in terms of peripheral awareness or of "how to meditate" at all, but who insists on complete renunciation and abandonment of the world *without* resorting to absorption into trance states (which precludes abandoning anything relevant), and that would actually be much closer to the meditation Ajahn Nyanamoli is teaching. The Suttas define right meditation as the surmounting of sensuality and all unwholesome states, not as a specific manner of directing your attention. 

    If it were clear to people (which it seems to have been back in the Buddha's day) that concentrating upon one thing cannot possibly constitute samādhi—but only *suppression* of those unwholesome states, which isn't samādhi—then there would be no need to give any detailed descriptions of what to do with one's awareness. Ajahn Nyanamoli does so only because of the prevalence of such misunderstandings contemporarily.

    To put it simply, Ajahn Nyanamoli's instructions are not merely an approach to peripheral awareness coupled with a greater emphasis on Right View and dispassion, and it cannot be reverse-engineered by combining those elements. The whole is more than the sum of its parts in this case.

### My shaky reasons to keep the precepts

I had been keeping the 8 precepts quite easily last month, but near the end of the month I asked myself whether I really knew how keeping the precepts would lead to the ending of suffering. And I could give an artificial reason as to how it would: acting out of the 8 precepts necessarily implies acting out of craving, and if I abstain from acting out rightly, I would be diminishing craving, which is the cause of suffering. By this reason, I would be less liable to suffering.

This felt artificial because although "craving is the cause of suffering" seems intuitively true, I haven't arrived at the truth of that for myself. Since if it were the case that I *truly* identified craving as suffering, 99% of present efforts in my life would collapse. It felt like someone else did the homework for me to arrive at the "truth". Instead of knowing the Noble Truth of Cause of Suffering, I know, and can guarantee, the equivalent Puthujjana Truth of Cause of Suffering: the World *has* suffering, and removal of *things in the World* is removal of suffering. It is of absolute certainty to me that when I'm suffering, I can, by means of interacting with the world, remove that suffering. If I have some diagnosable dental issue, I can get it fixed. Except of course when I can't, which is what happened to me and what led me to look for some internal way out of suffering when I had significant chronic pain. This kind of certainty is not present to any extent with holding the view that "craving is suffering" although it sounds intuitively true.

I never had a single strong reason for keeping the precepts, the reasons would fluctuate. Sometimes it would be because of the fact that I was suffering significantly and keeping the precepts could somehow help in removing the suffering *eventually*. Sometimes it would be for worldly reasons like removing entertainment to get work done. But the reason was never established on genuinely seeing a correlation between breaking them and harm. I now am utterly clueless regarding why I should keep the precepts since I can simply abstain from entertainment while doing work to get it done quickly, and then proceed to go back to entertainment. But after a while, I start to see some kind of fundamental dissatisfaction in all the entertainment I engage in: I hop from one thing to another thing to another thing, and there's just constant dissatisfaction on some level while doing all of this even though it feels pleasant on the surface. But this fundamental dissatisfaction doesn't seem dissatisfactory enough for me to quit entertainment. I can tell myself that I had suffered significantly before, and it was indeed quite a significant amount of suffering but it barely causes any emotional reaction now. Same is the case for future suffering, it feels artificial.

I can't find good reason anymore even though I'd really like it if I had one. I want a reason that is absolute in some sense, that I can keep regardless of my mind's moods. But I don't know if that absoluteness depends on the reason *itself* or on myself to keep that reason absolute. I went from the 8 precepts to just the 5 now since they've been the natural state for me. I would like it if I could get some help on how to proceed from this slug. It feels like I'm stuck in some kind of loophole here. What *is* a good reason to keep the precepts?

- **[Bhikkhu_Anigha](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/16wf0s3/my_shaky_reasons_to_keep_the_precepts/k2zlyx2/)** _2023-10-01 12:04:02:

    In order for the practice to be correct in the first place, one has to be doing it without the aid of external motivations. Having an external motivation for your practice is none other than *sīlabbataparāmāsa*.

    "External" doesn't just refer to things literally out there in the world; it includes even an inspired mood that you might have one day but not the next.

    And the crux of the entire Dhamma is that the ignorant mind inherently *resists* the burden of having to say no to unwholesome things—that's the *sole problem*, which is why one is responsible for it. That's why it feels like there must be a *justification* for renunciation: you wouldn't do work that is uncomfortable unless there's a reward at the end, and this itself is the principle of gain and sensuality. 

    So the solution is not the find the perfect motivator, which will mean you're still operating in terms of sensual craving, but to stop resisting the work altogether, so that it's not uncomfortable anymore. Only then your views about sensuality can start to change; otherwise, subtler sensuality will be your motivation for abandoning coarser sensuality.

    So, counterintuitively, renunciation becomes pleasant and sustains itself *not* when that burden of responsibility to say no to things is not there anymore, but when you start finding that *same burden* pleasant. That will happen if you learn how to stop resisting it and see it for what it is. And nothing that just happens to you or that you hear from someone else will magically get you to stop resisting it in an instant. 

    >I can't find good reason anymore even though I'd really like it if I had one. I want a reason that is absolute in some sense, that I can keep regardless of my mind's moods. But I don't know if that absoluteness depends on the reason *itself* or on myself to keep that reason absolute.

    *You* keeping the reason absolute is what can eventually result in the reason that is absolute *in itself*. That's why enlightenment cannot be attained without "manly restraint, manly effort, manly determination," as the Suttas say. You can't expect it not to be *your* burden to go against the grain of your mind's moods until then. Nevertheless, that "manly effort" will not be equally unpleasant forever. You just can't know for how long.

    This is why there's always a need to keep one's trust in the practice one step ahead of one's reasoning (not *discard* one's reasoning like some would say), and endure the pain of doubt that results from that. 

    Insisting in having the reasoning first and the trust second will lead to one's practice being dependent on one's moods, because reasoning is subjective and is inherently secondary to moods, despite what rationalists would like to argue.

    >How do I develop trust when by definition a person without Right View is steeped in ignorance?

    Precisely by not forgetting this. The thing is that trust (saddhā) is often misconceived as an unquestioning attitude towards one's practice or teacher, which leads people to either adopt blind faith and wishful thinking, believing that that's somehow wholesome in-&-of itself, or to (rightly) reject that attitude, but then go too far into the opposite position and become skeptics who put their own judgement above all else and insist on following their own personal system of beliefs, or assume that whether bits and pieces from various teachings "resonate" with them is an accurate criterion. And *both* of these attitudes overestimate a puthujjana's ability to know what is beneficial and what isn't.

    To start with, right trust needs to remain on the level of "there is suffering, there is a way out, and there are those who have attained it". Nothing can be done until this is acknowledged. One's reasoning then needs to assist in preventing that trust from becoming blind faith or mere superficial inspiration, and directing it instead towards something that is least likely to be wrong (based on: concordance with the Suttas, what results people who practice this are actually getting, do they tell you "there is nothing to be attained, just stay in the present", does it force you to scrap the way you exist entirely or is it rather like a hobby, does it emphasize self-honesty or self-oblivion, does it regard it as "allowable" to not be restrained just because you wear a shirt and jeans instead of a robe, etc.)

    Once such a teaching is found, your trust must be made firm enough to stick to it and not change your mind before you have actually tested it far enough for oneself, or found compelling evidence that it's wrong which isn't based on your opinions or how it makes you *feel*. You employ that trust to refrain from fault-finding that relies only on your *beliefs* of what is right as opposed to universal principles (e.g. do become suspicious of someone who doesn't keep the precepts, doesn't live in seclusion, or is shady in their dealings, but not immediately of someone who merely doesn't fit your preconceptions of how one should talk). Your reasoning then needs to keep reminding you behind the scenes that no matter how convincing this all is, you still cannot say for sure for as long as you lack the Right View, *without* overriding the trust you have.

    This combination gives rise to a setup that does not allow you to find misguided, premature certainty and commit mainly based on your emotions (which is how you could end up "burnt") nor to throw your hands up in the air and conclude that there is no way out and indulgence in the world is justified. And it forces you to *endure* the doubt and uncertainty of not-knowing and not cover them up, which is the prerequisite for arriving at where doubt and uncertainty cannot reach.

    >Can it be "There is suffering, there *might* be a way out, and if there is a way out others probably attained it"? Because, to be honest, I don't actually know.

    It could start like that, but as one begins to recognize more profoundly the nature of dukkha, one would not be able to tolerate the possibility that there is no way out and still keep one's sanity. You wouldn't be 100% positive that there is a way out until you realize it, but at that point it would become unthinkable to just give up the search and go back to "normal life". Most people's recognition of dukkha, despite it *being there*, is not this strong, and that's partially caused by having covered up the liability to suffering by means of sensuality and comfort for too long.

    >“And what is the result of suffering? Here, someone overcome by suffering, with a mind obsessed by it, sorrows, languishes, and laments; he weeps beating his breast and falls into bewilderment. Or else, overcome by suffering, with a mind obsessed by it, he embarks upon a search outside, saying: ‘Who knows one or two teachings for putting an end to this suffering?’ Suffering, I say, results either in bewilderment or in search. This is called the result of suffering.
    —AN 6.63

    >Bhikkhus, here some clansman goes forth out of faith from the home life into homelessness, considering: ‘I am a *victim* of birth, ageing, and death, of sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair; I am a victim of suffering, a *prey* to suffering. Surely an ending of this whole mass of suffering can be known.’—MN 38
    .

    

    >I thought TWIM was the thing because unlike everything else I've tried, it was actually based on the suttas. But with more knowledge, I realized it wasn't. In total, this has been about 8 years of practice.

    If it took you so long to put aside these teachings, it would be good to examine your motivations for taking up the practice to begin with, and to what extent you have seen the problem of dukkha. These practices you mention wouldn't be perceived as sufficient for very long for someone who has authentically recognized that they are "prey to suffering" and feels the acute burden of that situation. It would quickly become clear to them that the burden they are carrying is not being permanently lessened, and that they're merely being given various management strategies (based on ceasing to acknowledge the suffering, more often than not), with which one can only cross one's fingers (or be full on deluded) that they'll work at the time of severe loss, illness and death.  The fact that they talk about the Suttas wouldn't be enough to obscure that insufficiency.

    
    So try to reflect more on what dukkha actually is, especially  that "liability" and being "prey to it" aspect. The fact that things *could* happen to you at any time—loss, sickness, aging, death, disappointments or simply perpetual dissatisfaction—irrespective of how relatively free from immediate dukkha you may be at the time (and you are especially vulnerable when that present not-as-bad state depends on things and people that you could very well lose).

    A recognition along the lines that "sensuality is unhappiness" is not quite enough, since the practices you mentioned technically provide an alternative to coarse sensuality that could seem sufficient for the ignorant mind, which inherently doesn't see the full scope of what sensuality is.
     
    When you feel that no matter what you do and where you hide, suffering *could* be about to pounce on you, you will have an accurate criterion to measure which teachings can potentially solve that situation, and you will instead lack the gumption to not practice.
