### [What is the "you" that chooses what to allow the wild animal to engage with?](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1hru147/what_is_the_you_that_chooses_what_to_allow_the/)

What is the "you" that chooses what sense objects to engage with or present to the wild animal?

Do you have control over that "you" and the choices it makes? Or is that also determined by further factors down the chain?

If you do have control, then what is the you that has control? Isn't that antithetical to the teaching of the Buddha? You would be some kind of seperate acausal entity. You could've chosen not to be in ignorance in the first place. Whether or not you are pressured by the world would be completely up to you. But we know that we are ALREADY pressured - that's the starting point.

If you don't have control, what is the basis for that "you" that chooses what to engage with? And therefore, what is the basis of an ignorant mind, and what is the basis of an enlightened mind?

    >What is the "you" that chooses what sense objects to engage with or present to the wild animal?

    In simple terms, you could say it's the faculty of attention.

    >Do you have control over that "you" and the choices it makes? Or is that also determined by further factors down the chain?

    You can only attend to something because it is there as possible-to-be-attended-to already, cognized by your sense bases, without you having any ultimate say in what's available and what isn't.

    >You could've chosen not to be in ignorance in the first place. Whether or not you are pressured by the world would be completely up to you. 

    From the above, you can see that this doesn't really follow. In your own experience, is moving your attention to something else a fundamentally reliable method of avoiding suffering? If so, how come many people fall into depression anyways?

    >what is the basis of an ignorant mind, and what is the basis of an enlightened mind?

    Not sure what you mean by this. Assuming you're asking what is the cause of each, a simple way to put it is that the ignorant mind continues to put an emphasis on the little control that it has and overlooks the more fundamental non-control. The enlightened mind does the opposite.

    It bears mentioning that "not allowing the wild animal to engage with things" is not what leads to enlightenment alone. That's what anyone who attains samadhi even with wrong view would have to do. A tamed animal (assuming the taming came from the gradual training and not a meditation technique) is but a *suitable basis* for enlightenment.

### [Is jhana necessary for enlightenment?](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1hrlr9i/is_jhana_necessary_for_enlightenment/)

I don't even fully understand what jhana is, mostly because of the many contradictory teachings from many different people who all say they know what it is and how to get it. I've sort of decided for a while to just not bother with the whole matter and do my practice. But is jhana a necessary part of the Buddha's instructions for awakening? If I don't know what it is, will whatever it is be cultivated if I'm practicing everything else correctly? 

My basic point is - do I need to have this term clearly defined in the correct way, and is jhana a state I need to work towards intentionally, or is it something that will arise naturally by doing other things that support it?

    >My basic point is - do I need to have this term clearly defined in the correct way, and is jhana a state I need to work towards intentionally, or is it something that will arise naturally by doing other things that support it?

    Unless you've already been leading a lifestyle of virtue (avoiding any verbal or bodily action driven by defilements and not just keeping rules), celibacy, restraining your senses, not tolerating the slightest unskillful thought, and seclusion for a good while and somehow you still haven't attained jhāna, then the answer is the latter. The Buddha always began his instructions on how to enter jhana not with a special technique for focusing on sensations, but by listing all these things, starting all the way down from virtue.

    The contradictory teachings you mention are due to an underemphasis or altogether dismissal of those prerequisites. For someone who does fulfill them, and doesn't get distracted by any of the various views about what jhāna is, withdrawal from unwholesome states will take place regardless of their wishes. And that withdrawal is pleasant and joyful on its own because the hindrances are a burden that is now gone, because they were not acted out of and fueled for long enough. Not because some contrived method of fabricating joy is involved. Each teacher coming up with their own such method and justifications for it and putting that first, giving the prerequisites an honorary mention, if any, is the reason for all the discrepancies.

    And yes, jhāna (read: successful abandoning of sensuality and all forms of aversion) is indispensable for enlightenment.

    >And am I correct that you are saying jhana is not a state to be arrived at by putting yourself in a trance through a series of steps in accordance with a technique? Rather jhana is the pleasure that arises when one is sufficiently withdrawn from sensuality because of the intentional act of abandoning it throughout their life, not just temporarily during meditation, while being asleep, or for a period of time on retreat?

    Correct.

    >Does this mean there are non-Buddhist jhanas that Hindu yogis can attain through trance states, but this is something different from what the Buddha called jhana?

    Yes. They're such a different thing that arises out of such a different mode of practice (which the Buddha happens to never have talked about) that it's a bit of a stretch tocall them jhānas, really. The fact that the people who practice that way are often still engaged in sensuality outside of their meditation points to the fact that it's not the state the Buddha described, on account of which even a puthujjana would go beyond such pleasures.

    >Does this imply that jhana is a sensual experience too, but just a highly refined sensual experience because it is free from unwholesomeness?

    "Sensual experience" and "free from unwholesomeness" going together is a contradiction in terms. One enters jhāna by being completely withdrawn from sensuality, as the Suttas always say.

    >How would one go about "letting go" of jhana?

    [By applying the same attitude to it as one did to sensuality and the world in order to enter jhāna](https://suttas.hillsidehermitage.org/?q=mn64#mn64:9.1_mn64:9.9).

    >Then what you are saying is that jhana will not arise for anyone until anagami stage?

    Certainly not. Often people struggle to see the middle line we are trying to convey between "jhāna can be attained by anyone and their mother by doing a meditation technique" on one extreme and "jhāna cannot be attained by anyone but an anāgāmi". 

    Jhāna is the culmination of building up a momentum of renunciation and disinterest in the world through one's lifestyle. But that doesn't mean that the opposite momentum towards sensuality can never return. It will sooner or later, even if only in a next life, unless one develops the insight that destroys the fetters regardless of jhāna.

    People who have been well withdrawn from sensuality, company, distractions, and worldly activity for a good while would be able to see that their minds have greater perspective, and are in general less disturbed by things. A lot of people would report that after staying at a monastery for a while. That's at least a few steps in the direction of jhāna. 

    But this would soon fade once they return to the world and start breaking precepts again, etc. One would also ironically be prevented from getting to that modicum of proper samādhi even if the external conditions are right when engaging in a meditation technique, since that's often yet another activity of pursuing pleasure and avoiding pain that takes the place of the external activities that were abandoned. What comes out of that isn't a truly calm state, but another ecstatic pleasure that tires you out eventually.

### [Getting up early and napping during the day](https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1hrco03/getting_up_early_and_napping_during_the_day/)

So, I get up pretty early and after I eat my meal for the day at 8:00 I'm often useless for the next several hours and struggle to meditate or be mindful.  I eat in moderation so that's not the issue.  I have to fiercely fight to stay awake after eating and often can't sit down for a couple hours after eating or I'll just go into oblivion.  I'm tempted to take naps all the time but it's really hit or miss if they actually make me function better.  

Is it better to just power through and not nap until my mind stops steering to that as an option and gets used to it? (like it does steering to eat more after my meal but before noon since it's "allowable") 

This sleep stuff really sucks because it feel like my body wants to get up this early, and I'd probably feel gross going back to more sleep at this point. Sometimes it's like the only time my mind relaxes and the pain in my neck goes away is when it's time for bed. It's really frustrating that calm might only come at that time and I have to meditate and live with anxiety and neck pain otherwise.  I feel like I'm over determining things but I don't know how to stop. 

Edit: A few of you mentioned food intolerance and I think that must be it.  I think it's my whey protein.  I had an inkling that might be an issue for a while but didn't test it out properly.  It's that subtle inner feminine voice that I seem to often miss or ignore, and then stumble around this way and that before I finally listen to them to see that once again, they were right.  It's a very male thing to prioritize thinking, logic, and prior determinations over intuition.

    If you know you're not tired due to some specific physical reason like recent strenuous activity or some food intolerance, then the problem might be that you're expecting the dull state after the meal not to be there, with the wrong view that "only then" can you practice. That aversion would in turn make the sleepiness worse.

    The hindrance of sloth and torpor is not due to the drowsiness after the meal in and of itself, but due to your *ayoniso manasikāra* towards it:

    >“And what, bhikkhus, is the nutriment for the arising of unarisen sloth and torpor and for the increase and expansion of arisen sloth and torpor? There are, bhikkhus, discontent, lethargy, lazy stretching, drowsiness after meals, sluggishness of mind: frequent *ayoniso manasikāra* to them is the nutriment for the arising of unarisen sloth and torpor and for the increase and expansion of arisen sloth and torpor.
