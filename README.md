# Packages for PDF local package generation

[Install pandocs and PDF generation for the proper OS by following this link.](https://pandoc.org/installing.html)

[Install the latest Source Serif font from this repo.](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-serif/releases) This should be the *_Desktop.zip, not *_WOFF.zip which is intended for web.

For Windows, unpack the zip file, select all the *.ttf fonts, right click, then click on "install" to add the fonts to the OS.

Installing fonts in other OS's should be very similar.
